Because two other hypothalamic peptides, neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide, increase food intake by a mechanism that depends on activation of opioid receptors, we assessed whether MCH or orexin-A also elicits food intake via opioid receptor activation. A dose of naloxone (0.3 mg/kg, ip) that had no effect on its own reduced the acute orexigenic effect of third ventricular (i3vt) orexin-A (3 ng/rat). However, this same dose of naloxone had no effect on i3vt MCH (5  microg/rat)-induced hyperphagia. Because the opioid system has also been linked to food selection, we investigated whether MCH or orexin-A alters food choice when rats have simultaneous access to two diets differing in the relative amounts of fat and carbohydrate. Whereas i3vt MCH stimulated intake of both diets and did not alter food choice, i3vt orexin-A stimulated intake of only the high fat diet. These data indicate that despite several similarities between MCH and orexin-A, these two lateral hypothalamic area peptides stimulate food intake by recruiting different neural circuits and exert different effects on food choice..

Animals with lesions of the LHA exhibit hypophagia, increased metabolic rate, decreased arousal, and extreme weight loss (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). They also fail to respond with appropriate adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to homeostatic challenges such as fasting (6). Because electrical stimulation of the LHA results in a vigorous feeding response as well (see review in Ref. 2), the LHA was historically regarded as the hypothalamic feeding center and was considered to be an important integrating site for the somatic and autonomic controls over ingestion. Related to these functional observations, the LHA has extensive anatomical projections within the hypothalamus as well as throughout the entire neuroaxis, facilitating its coordination of metabolic, motivational, motor, autonomic, and arousal processes important in energy homeostasis (6)..

MCH is expressed predominately in the LHA (10, 11), and several lines of investigation implicate it as a key regulator of food intake and body weight (7, 12, 13, 14). First, MCH gene expression is influenced by changes in energy balance. The adipocyte hormone leptin inhibits MCH gene expression, and food restriction increases MCH gene expression (15). Second, intracerebroventricular administration of exogenous MCH stimulates food intake (7, 13, 14), and mice that overexpress MCH are obese and insulin resistant (13). Finally, mice with targeted disruption of the MCH gene have reduced food intake and body weight accompanied by increased metabolic rate, resulting in little or no body fat (15)..

In this regard they are similar to agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptides made in the same population of neurons within the arcuate nucleus. Both NPY and AgRP, when administered exogenously, increase food intake (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). As axons from the LHA project to the medial hypothalamus, including the arcuate, and as the AgRP/NPY neurons in the arcuate project to the LHA (27, 28, 29), understanding the functional interactions among these peptides is important. NPY- and AgRP-induced increases in food intake are dependent on opioid receptor activation, as this action is blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (30, 31). Activation of the opioid system, in turn, has been associated with increased intake of preferred, high fat-containing diets (32). Consistent with this, we found that AgRP selectively increases the intake of a high fat diet when rats have simultaneous access to two diets differing in their relative amounts of carbohydrate and fat (31). On the other hand, administration of NPY reportedly increases the consumption of high carbohydrate diets (33, 34), although this has been attributed to a stimulation of whichever diet an individual rat prefers (35, 36). The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether the orexigenic action of MCH and orexin-A depends upon activity at opioid receptors, and whether these peptides influence diet selection..

However, the same dose when administered in conjunction with i3vt AgRP reliably reduced the increase in food intake elicited by AgRP (31). Experiment 1 was a replication of that experiment to confirm that 0.3 mg/kg NALX, ip, is, in fact, subthreshold in this cohort of rats and to reconfirm that it attenuates AgRP-induced overeating. Rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups (n = 8 or 9/group) matched by preexperimental body weight and food intake. On the test day, food was removed 2 h before lights off. Thirty minutes before lights off, rats in two groups received an ip injection of 0.3 mg/kg NALX, and rats in the other two groups received an equal volume of saline. Ten minutes later, one naloxone and one saline group received an i3vt injection of 1 nmol AgRP/2  microl, and the other two groups received saline (2  microl). This dose of AgRP elicits a reliable and long-lasting increase in food intake (25, 26, 38). Five minutes before lights off, food was returned to the cages, and intake was measured after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h. Water was available at all times..

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the orexigenic effect of orexin-A critically depends on activation of opioid receptors downstream of its receptor, whereas the orexigenic action of MCH does not. The data also indicate that although both orexin-A and MCH can increase food intake, their effects on food choice are quite distinct. Although orexin-A selectively stimulates consumption of a HF diet, MCH stimulates intake of each diet comparably.

The opioid system has long been implicated in the regulation of food intake, with increased opioid activity in the brain leading to increased caloric consumption (30, 39, 40, 41). In particular, opioids modulate the incentive value of food, with opioid agonists increasing and opioid antagonists decreasing it (30, 40, 42). Consistent with this, opioids alter the relative selection of, or preference for, specific foods. ss-Endorphin, for example, increases intake of a preferred HF diet (43, 44). Likewise, in the present experiments orexin-A selectively increased consumption of a preferred HF diet, and orexin-A-stimulated intake of pelleted chow was attenuated by the prior administration of naloxone. Hence, we conclude that orexin-A, like AgRP, uses opioid-mediated circuits for its orexigenic action. In contrast, a comparably orexigenic dose of MCH did not alter diet selection, and an MCH-elicited increase in pelleted chow was not influenced by naloxone. We therefore conclude that the opioid system is not a downstream mediator of MCH s orexigenic action..

The opioid system has long been implicated in the regulation of food intake, with increased opioid activity in the brain leading to increased caloric consumption (30, 39, 40, 41). In particular, opioids modulate the incentive value of food, with opioid agonists increasing and opioid antagonists decreasing it (30, 40, 42). Consistent with this, opioids alter the relative selection of, or preference for, specific foods. ss-Endorphin, for example, increases intake of a preferred HF diet (43, 44). Likewise, in the present experiments orexin-A selectively increased consumption of a preferred HF diet, and orexin-A-stimulated intake of pelleted chow was attenuated by the prior administration of naloxone.

We therefore conclude that the opioid system is not a downstream mediator of MCH s orexigenic action..
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	46	Considerable controversy surrounds the contention that macronutrient intake is selectively regulated by different central nervous system systems (45), including the opioids (42, 46, 47). As an example, when a drug or other treatment is given, it cannot easily be ascertained whether an increase (or decrease) in one particular food choice relative to another reflects a preference (aversion) for a specific macronutrient (e.g. fat vs. carbohydrate) or whether it reflects a magnified (minimized) preexisting preference based upon palatability (48). Regardless of the actual mechanism, the critical observation is that orexin-A and MCH influence food intake via distinct mechanisms that can be dissociated by use of opioid antagonists and/or by considering food selection. Because AgRP s orexigenic action is also reduced by naloxone, and because AgRP selectively increases intake of the preferred HF diet (31), we conclude that orexin-A and AgRP act through a common mechanism. Recent data from our laboratory (49, 50) and others (51) indicate that an orexigenic dose of AgRP increases Fos activity in the LHA, and dual label immunohistochemistry indicates that the increased activity is in orexin-A-producing neurons. Importantly, AgRP does not increase Fos activity in MCH-producing neurons (50, 51). Hence, functional anatomical data are consistent with the pharmacological and behavioral data..

The present data do not allow determination of whether AgRP stimulates orexin-A neurons, and these, in turn, stimulate food intake by acting via opioid receptors. Additionally, these data do not determine whether the pathway is orexin-A to AgRP to opioid circuits, or whether other relay sites are involved that integrate information from both AgRP and orexin-A inputs. Added to this are the facts that AgRP neurons in the arcuate cosynthesize NPY, and NPY-elicited food intake is also naloxone dependent. Hence, NPY, AgRP, and orexin-A all appear to share a common circuit at some point..

Much of this growth has been fueled by the application of sophisticated molecular biological approaches and the pressing clinical need to treat the exponential growth in obesity. To develop appropriate therapeutic strategies, however, this "alphabet soup" of peptides and transmitters will need to be organized into functional circuits. The identification of such functional circuits will depend on intensive efforts to delineate both the neuroanatomical relationship among these systems as well as their functional interactions. The present results demonstrate that two peptides located within a single hypothalamic subarea, peptides that appear to be regulated similarly by energy balance and that each stimulate food intake, act via distinct behavioral and neural mechanisms. Such results point to the complexity of a homeostatic system that was designed to do much more than regulate the intake of a rat with ad libitum access to a single caloric source. Rather, the existence of two LHA subsystems that influence food intake in different ways emphasizes a system with great flexibility to respond to a myriad of environmental and physiological challenges..

In this context, however, it remains debatable whether class II MHC molecules are the initiating event or rather the consequence of the autoimmune attack. In addition, the role of epithelial class II expression once the autoimmune attack has begun is unknown. We generated transgenic mice expressing in the thyroid follicular cells the class II transactivator, the master regulator of all the genes in the class II MHC pathway. The study used a cohort of 245 CBA/J mice (127 wild-type and 118 transgenic), both in basal conditions (n = 63) and at different time points after immunization with mouse thyroglobulin (n = 182). In basal conditions, transgenic mice were similar to wild-type controls and did not develop spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis, despite the aberrant expression of class II MHC molecules on thyrocytes. After immunization, thyroiditis was 8% more severe in transgenics than controls (95% confidence interval from 1.8 to 13.4%; P = 0.033), especially during the florid stages of disease. These findings suggest that expression of class II MHC molecules on epithelial cells is not sufficient to initiate autoimmunity but mildly modulates an already established autoimmune attack against the target organ..

The first described and most potent genetic influence known to affect susceptibility to autoimmune thyroiditis, however, is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

Its main functions are to guide the intracellular processing of antigens and to display antigenic peptides on the plasma membrane for recognition by T lymphocytes (7). It is the most gene-dense region of the genome, containing 224 loci (96 pseudogenes and 128 expressed genes) grouped in three classes. Class II MHC genes are constitutively expressed only on hematopoietic cells involved in antigen presentation (dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and cortical thymic epithelial cells) but can be induced by inflammatory stimuli on many other cell types (such as endothelial cells, hepatocytes, ss-cells of the pancreas, and thyrocytes). Little is known about the biological significance of this observation, although it has been implicated in allograft rejection (8) and subsequently in autoimmunity. In this field, Bottazzo and Feldman hypothesized that class II MHC molecules, when aberrantly expressed on epithelial cells, confer to them antigen-presenting functions favoring the initiation of autoimmune diseases (9, 10)..

There are, however, important factors that could confound the above-described association. First, MHC loci are found together at frequencies much higher than would be expected by random combination of their frequencies in the population. It is thus possible that the genes causing disease are not the MHC genes per se but rather genes that travel with the MHC. For example, polymorphisms of the LMP2 and LMP7 genes, which are embedded within the class II region, have been associated with ankylosing spondylitis (20). In addition, the same allele that is associated with a particular disease is also common in the normal, unaffected population, and actually the majority of patients with the susceptible allele do not develop autoimmune disease. Finally, it is unknown whether to initiate autoimmunity MHC molecules have to be expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells within secondary lymphoid organs or rather on nonhematopoietic cells of the target organ itself, such as the thyroid follicular cell in the case of autoimmune thyroiditis..

Sera were diluted in PBS (1/100, 1/400) and incubated overnight in Immulon2 ELISA plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA), precoated with mouse thyroglobulin (100 ng/well). After proper washing, mouse thyroglobulin-specific IgG subclasses were detected using secondary antibodies against IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The color change of p-nitrophenol phosphate was measured at 405 nm using the Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each plate included a homemade standard curve, derived from serial dilutions of a pool serum with known mouse thyroglobulin antibodies. The standard curve allowed us to express the results in arbitrary units (rather than absorbance), thus adjusting for intra- and interassay variability..

The first phase analyzed cross-sectionally whether the mean severity of thyroid lesions (the thyroid histopathology score) differed between wild-type and thyr-CIITA transgenic mice. The crude (unadjusted) effect of the covariate genotype on the outcome thyroid histopathology score was calculated by simple linear regression, ignoring the effect of all the other covariates. Then, the net (adjusted) effect of genotype on thyroid histopathology score, holding all other covariates fixed, was calculated by multiple linear regression. The covariates relating to thyroid histopathology score considered for inclusion in the model, in addition to genotype, were sex, transgenic line, day of killing after the first immunization, total T4 at d 0, TSH at d 0, and thyroglobulin-specific antibodies at d 0. Day of killing after immunization was treated as a dummy variable, with d 0 chosen as the reference category. Using stepwise backward selection, we removed sex, total T4 at d 0, TSH at d 0, and thyroglobulin-specific antibodies at d 0, based on P values greater than 0.05. The final multiple linear regression model, therefore, included genotype, transgenic line, and day of killing as covariates used to estimate the mean thyroid histopathology score. Analysis of the residuals after fitting this regression model indicated nonnormality and heteroscedasticity. We thus used bootstrapping with 2000 replications to estimate SE around each regression coefficient and perform valid hypothesis testing from regression analysis of the nonnormal thyroid histopathology scores. We also analyzed the cumulative incidence of thyroiditis in transgenic and controls, labeling as thyroiditis cases those mice with a thyroid histopathology score greater than 2.5%. RRs at each time point after immunization were then expressed as ratio of the incidence of thyroiditis in transgenic over the incidence in wild-type mice. Confidence intervals around the RRs were calculated in the logarithmic scale and results then exponentiated. Fisher s exact test was used to test the null hypothesis that RRs were equal to 1..

In both groups of mice, thyroid lesions were already present, although minimal (12% of the total thyroid area), at d 10 post immunization (Fig. 5). They then increased to 65% on d 14 and reached a peak of 90% on d 21 (Figs. 3, C and D, and 5). In wild-type mice, the thyroid histopathology score decreased to approximately 45% and remained around that value until d 100 (Fig. 5). In thyr-CIITA transgenic, instead, the score remained higher and became significantly higher than controls at d 35. Simple linear regression assessing the crude effect of genotype on score revealed that transgenic mice tended to have a more severe disease, with an average score that was 5% higher than that seen in wild-type, although this difference was not marked (P = 0.046). Multiple linear regression showed that, holding transgenic line and day of killing constant, thyr-CIITA transgenic mice had an average thyroid histopathology score that was 8% higher than that seen in wild-type (95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 13.4%; P = 0.033).

Among the humoral predictors measured in this study (total T4, TSH, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b thyroglobulin antibodies), TSH was the best predictor of the thyroid histopathology score. Multiple linear regression showed that for every 100-U increase in serum TSH, the score increased by 6.1% (95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 8.0%; P  <  0.00001)..

In some cases, such as ankylosing spondylitis (29) and birdshot retinochoroidopathy (30), the strength of this association is so high (i.e. RRs around 100) that there should be little doubt about a causative role of MHC molecules in the pathway leading to autoimmunity. Yet, quoting from S. Beck and J. Trowsdale, "in no case can it be argued that a particular MHC allele is necessary or sufficient to cause autoimmune disease" (31). Also unknown is the importance of location; that is, whether MHC molecules play a causal role when expressed in secondary lymphoid organs or rather on parenchymal cells of the organ targeted by the autoimmune attack (32)..

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	65	We focused on class II MHC molecules and used experimental autoimmune thyroiditis as a classical model of organ-specific autoimmunity. Class II molecules are primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells of the hematopoietic lineage but can also be induced on endothelial and epithelial cells. This observation raised the question of whether nonhematopoietic parenchymal cells can function as antigen-presenting cells and whether they are required for damage to the target organ. Much of the work comes from the transplantation field and has generated conflicting results. On one side, Lakkis et al. (33) found that mice lacking all secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues) are incapable of rejecting either skin allografts or primarily vascularized cardiac allografts, suggesting that secondary lymphoid organs are required for initiating the immune response. Similarly, Teshima et al. (34), using a model of graft-vs.-host disease in bone marrow chimeras expressing MHC molecules only on antigen-presenting cells but not on epithelial or endothelial cells, found that the graft was capable of inducing epithelial damage in the target organs (skin, gut, and liver) of the host that expressed MHC molecules only on the host antigen-presenting cells and not on the host target epithelium. These studies are consistent with recent direct visual evidence of the immune response, indicating that naive T cells constantly roam through secondary lymphoid organs where they encounter antigen-presenting cells that have taken up antigen from the target organs and brought it into the lymphoid organs (35, 36, 37, 38). These studies are also consistent with the notion that naive T cells possess receptors necessary for homing to secondary lymphoid organs rather than to nonlymphoid organs and with the notion that nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells usually lack the costimulatory molecules required for complete T cell activation. On the other side, however, Kreisel et al. (39) showed that naive CD8 T cells can indeed be activated in vitro and in vivo by nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells, most likely endothelial cells, and lead to prompt rejection of the cardiac allograft, suggesting that endothelial expression of MHC molecules can direct pathogenic immune responses independently of the expression of MHC molecules on professional antigen-presenting cells..

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	67	We expressed via transgenesis the transcriptional regulator CIITA specifically in a nonprofessional antigen-presenting cell, the thyrocyte. CIITA is a transcription factor that when defective causes a severe primary immunodeficiency called bare lymphocyte syndrome (22), entirely attributable to the absence of class II MHC expression. CIITA is a true coactivator because it does not bind directly to DNA but mediates its function on the class II MHC promoter through interaction with other proteins (40). It is considered a master regulator because it is necessary and sufficient for the expression of all the genes in the MHC class II pathway (21), although it has been recently shown to control other genes outside the MHC (41). CIITA has three different isoforms synthesized from different, cell-specific promoters (42); promoter 1 is used in dendritic cells, promoter 3 in B lymphocytes, and promoter 4 in nonhematopoietic cells. We have previously shown in vitro that promoter 4 mediates interferon--induced transcription of CIITA in thyrocytes (43), and thus we used the type 4 isoform of CIITA for the present study..

They did not develop spontaneously autoimmune thyroiditis despite the aberrant expression of class II MHC molecules on thyrocytes. These findings are in agreement with a recent report by Li et al. (44), which shows that thyroidal expression of class II molecules driven by the TSH receptor promoter does not lead to apparent thyroid autoimmunity. The phenomenon does not seem to be limited to the thyroid gland. Stuve et al. (45) expressed CIITA, in fact, specifically in the central nervous system (using the promoter for the glial fibrillary protein), and Herkel et al. (46) expressed it in the liver (using the C-reactive protein promoter). In both cases, despite the aberrant expression of class II MHC molecules on astrocytes or hepatocytes, mice did not develop spontaneous autoimmunity. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the expression of class II MHC molecules on nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells is by itself not sufficient to initiate an autoimmune disease. We can postulate that this expression is more likely the results of inflammatory stimuli (such as interferon- and lipopolysaccharide) released once the immune cells infiltrate the target organ, rather than being the initiating event that recruits the immune cells to the target organ..

Upon immunization, thyr-CIITA transgenic mice developed thyroiditis that was moderately more severe and of greater incidence than that observed in wild-type littermates. The difference in severity, although higher in transgenics at all time points, became significantly higher only at d 35 after immunization. These results suggest that thyrocytes expressing class II MHC molecules play a secondary role in the initiation phase but can serve as better targets and facilitate greater immunopathology, once the process has already begun. Lack of significant difference in thyroiditis severity at earlier time points (d 10 to 28) can be explained by the fact that the immunization protocol we used was very effective in inducing thyroid lesions in the majority of the mice (incidence comprised between 86 and 95% in wild-type and 100% in transgenic)..

In these diseases, in fact, collectively referred to as autoimmune thyroiditis, the expression of class II molecules may indicate a particularly severe stage of the disease. This question is difficult to assess in humans; the use of a mouse model is essential because it allows us to analyze disease over a period of time, rather than at a single time point..

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	75	The greater severity of thyroid lesions displayed by thyr-CIITA transgenic was not a result of a greater number or function of activated T cells, considering that the CD4 T cells in the cervical lymph nodes expressed similar levels of activation markers in both wild-type and transgenics. The difference is more likely explained by the fact that thyrocytes expressing class II MHC molecules are better recognized by autoreactive CD4 T cells once these T cells have already expanded. In other words, thyrocytes may serve as endogenous immunogens that potentiate and expand the reactivity of T cells initially selected by the thyroglobulin immunization protocol. It is well established that T cell activation requires formation of a specialized cell-cell junction with the antigen-presenting cell, called the immunological synapse, which facilitates the outcome of immune recognition (48). The center of the synapse is occupied by T-cell receptor/CD3 complexes and CD4 coreceptors on the T cell side and by MHC/peptide complexes on the antigen-presenting side. Also in the center are costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD40 ligand on T cells and B7 and CD40 on antigen-presenting cells. The periphery of the synapse is instead occupied by integrins, such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and CD2 on T cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CD58 on antigen-presenting cells. To function efficiently as antigen-presenting cell, the thyrocytes that aberrantly express MHC class II molecules should also express costimulatory molecules and integrins. Thyrocytes from patients with Graves  disease and Hashimoto s thyroiditis have been shown to express the integrins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CD58 (49, 50) and the costimulator CD40 (51, 52). The expression on thyrocytes of B7, probably the most potent costimulator, is less firmly established, although it was reported in Hashimoto s thyroiditis (53) and differentiated thyroid tumors (54). B7 costimulation could also be supplied in trans from professional antigen-presenting cells to parenchymal cells (55). Thus, in theory, thyrocytes aberrantly expressing class II MHC molecules possess the signal transduction circuitry necessary for full T cell activation, although it is unknown whether individual components can associate in the supramolecular activation complex. Here we show that expression on thyrocytes of class II MHC is insufficient to initiate autoimmune thyroiditis. These results emphasize the importance of location in the initiation of the immune response, a location that likely requires the interaction between autoreactive T cell and antigen-presenting cells within the secondary lymphoid organs..

Central administration of AgRP produces a robust increase in food intake, and this effect can be blocked by administration of nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist. Such results implicate opioid receptors as critical to mediating the effects of AgRP. To determine which opioid receptor subtype is critical, we first determined the highest i3vt (administered into the third ventricle) dose of two specific opioid antagonists, nor-Binaltorphine or ss-funaltrexamine, that did not influence food intake on their own. Then, rats were pretreated with either of these two antagonists before i3vt AgRP and access to a high-fat diet. For neither the - nor the  micro-specific antagonist was there any effect to block the effects of AgRP on food intake. However, administration of both the - and  micro-receptor antagonists does significantly reduce the effect of AgRP. The current results implicate opioid receptors as critical downstream mediators of the potent effects of AgRP to increase food intake but indicate that either  micro- or -receptor activation is sufficient for AgRP s effect..

The MCs are a family of peptides that include -, ss-, and -MSH and ACTH. -MSH is an agonist at both the MC3 and 4 receptors, and central administration of -MSH or synthetic analogs, such as MTII, reduce food intake and body weight (3, 4). A unique feature of the MC system is that, in addition to the well-documented role for endogenous agonists, there is also an important role for endogenous antagonists for the various MC receptors. The first antagonist described in the MC system was agouti signaling protein (ASP). ASP acts in the periphery to alter MC1 receptor signaling to regulate peripheral skin and hair color (5). Overexpression of ASP results in a yellow coat color via the MC1 receptor (6). Overexpression of ASP also results in increased food intake and obesity via interaction with MC3 and 4 receptors in the CNS (4)..

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	7	Given that ASP is not normally found in the CNS, a role for ASP in regulating MC receptor signaling in the brain is unlikely. However, a homolog of ASP termed agouti-related protein (AgRP) is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in a population of neurons adjacent, but not overlapping, with neurons that produce -MSH (7, 8, 9). AgRP acts as an antagonist at the MC3 and MC4 receptors (7, 10). Hence, AgRP opposes the actions of -MSH. Consistent with this, AgRP and the -MSH precursor, proopiomelanocortin, are regulated in opposite directions by energy balance and leptin. Food deprivation decreases proopiomelanocortin gene expression, whereas it increases AgRP gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (11, 12, 13). Overexpression of AgRP results in an obese phenotype similar to that of mice that overexpress ASP (10)..

Although the short-term effects of AgRP seem to depend on antagonism at the identified MC receptors, the long-term effects do not (14). Moreover, like neuropeptide Y (NPY), the orexigenic effect of AgRP can be blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (16, 17). Thus, the potent effects of AgRP to increase food intake depend critically on activation of opioid receptors. Opioid receptors come in three identified subtypes:  micro, , and (18); and of these, both  micro and have been strongly implicated in the control of food intake (19). Thus, the aim of these experiments was to assess the role of these specific opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP to increase food intake..

Nor-Binaltorphimine (NorBNI) hydrochloride and ss-funaltrexamine (ss-FNA) hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). NorBNI has been widely used as a selective antagonist for -opioid receptors (20, 21), and ss-FNA has been widely used as a selective  micro-opioid receptor antagonist (18, 22). The selective antagonist action of ss-FNA has a unique time course, becoming more selective for this action over an apparent 20 h after administration (23). Thus, for all of the experiments, ss-FNA is actually administered 20 h before food intake measurements. AgRP was dissolved in physiological saline, which served as the control solution. NorBNI and ss-FNA were dissolved in 100% methanol that served as their control solution. All solutions were administered i3vt in a 2- microl vol..

For the remaining 22 h, the rats had access to pelleted laboratory chow (Harlan-Teklad, Indianapolis, IN). This paradigm was used because it produces very reliable 2-h intakes and because both AgRP and the ligands of the opioid receptors potently influence intake of a preferred HF diet more than other diets (24). Consequently, if opioids are important in mediating the effects of AgRP, it is more likely to be observed during HF feeding than alternative paradigms. Water was available ad libitum.

The one-way ANOVA on 2 h cumulative intake was significant [F(3, 18) = 3.211 P  <  0.05]. Injection of 10 nmol NorBNI significantly reduced intake of the HF diet during the first 2 h of the dark phase, compared with vehicle (P  <  0.05). The total 2-h intake is representative of the intake at earlier times (data not shown). The 5-nmol dose had no reliable effect on 2-h intake and was therefore the highest subthreshold dose for use in subsequent experiments (see Fig. 1). No dose of NorBNI reduced chow intake over the subsequent 22 h (data not shown). In all of our experiments, methanol was used as the vehicle. Under some conditions, methanol has been shown to be toxic to neurons. To determine whether methanol could independently influence food intake in our rats, we compared the food intake on the day before the beginning of the injections to the methanol-alone condition. On the methanol-alone day, rats ate 13.8  plus or minus  0.96 g; whereas, on the noninjection day, rats consumed 14.2  plus or minus  1.1 g (P  >  0.05, paired-sample t test), indicating that, in this paradigm, methanol alone did not have a significant effect on intake..

The one-way ANOVA on 2-h cumulative intake was significant [F(3, 18) = 3.334 P  <  0.05], and post hoc analyses revealed that injection of 1 nmol ss-FNA significantly suppressed 2-h intake of the HF diet, compared with vehicle (P  <  0.05,). There was a nonsignificant trend (P = 0.06) for the 0.5-nmol dose to inhibit food intake (see Fig. 2). Consequently, we chose to use 0.1 nmol as the highest, clearly subthreshold dose for further experiments. Chow intake over the following 22 h was not reduced by any dose of ss-FNA..

There was no effect of NorBNI to influence food intake [F(1, 16) = 1.3, P  >  0.05], nor was there a significant interaction between AgRP and NorBNI [F(1, 16) = 0.72, P  >  0.05, see Fig. 3]. Thus, unlike subthreshold doses of the nonspecific opioid antagonist naloxone, NorBNI did not reduce AgRP s orexigenic effect at 2 h. It should be noted that the baseline food intakes (both on uninjected days and on the vehicle-injected days) are lower in experiments 3, 4, and 5 than in experiments 1 and 2. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were all run during the summer months, when both the ambient temperature and ambient humidity are higher than in February, when experiments 1 and 2 were run. Despite the vivarium being both temperature and humidity controlled, we have observed in other experiments that the animal rooms do have higher levels of humidity during the summer and that this reduces consumption of the HF diet. Importantly, the dose of NorBNI that we determined to be subthreshold in experiment 1 remained subthreshold in experiment 3 despite the lower baseline food intakes..

This result is potentially analogous to NPY, where suprathreshold doses of either - and  micro- (but not -) receptor antagonists reduce the orexigenic effect of NPY (25).

Microinjection experiments have identified numerous sites, at every level of the neuroaxis, in which opioid agonist and antagonists affect food intake (for review, see Ref. 30). In particular, whereas opioid agonists and antagonists increase and decrease food intake, respectively, they also influence food choice. Both - and  micro- selective antagonists have been found to decrease intake of an HF diet to a greater extent than they decrease intake of a high-carbohydrate diet (31). Controversy exists, however, as to whether the effect of opioids is to alter the animal s choice of macronutrients or simply to drive the organism to consume more of an already preferred food (32). Regardless of the interpretation, this is consistent with an important role for these opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP. Similar to what occurs after manipulation of opioid receptor signaling, administration of AgRP selectively increases intake of a preferred HF diet (17). Additionally, stimulation of  micro-receptors in the nucleus accumbens preferentially enhances HF feeding (33). Such strong parallels between AgRP and opioid receptor ligands on food intake and food selection strengthen the hypothesis that these two systems interact in an important way to influence food intake and food choice..

In these experiments, the opioid receptor antagonists were delivered into the third ventricle and, hence, close to the hypothalamus. However, given the lipophyllic nature of these compounds and the rostral- to-caudal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system, it is likely that these antagonists could interact with opioid receptors in a variety of neuroanatomical sites (34). Although these experiments, therefore, cannot determine the exact location of the critical  micro- and -opioid receptors, some clues can be derived from the areas that show increases in fos-like-immunoreactivity after third-ventricular administration of AgRP. Two hours after AgRP administration, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, and paraventricular and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. After 24 h, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus of the solitary tract (35). All of these regions show evidence for  micro- or -receptor binding and/or expression, but only the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral hypothalamus show high levels of binding for both receptors (33, 36, 37). Future research will need to address whether the activation of either  micro- or -receptor subtypes sufficient to produce AgRP s effects is in the same neuroanatomical sites or occurs as a result of activation in disparate sites..

In these experiments, the opioid receptor antagonists were delivered into the third ventricle and, hence, close to the hypothalamus. However, given the lipophyllic nature of these compounds and the rostral- to-caudal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system, it is likely that these antagonists could interact with opioid receptors in a variety of neuroanatomical sites (34). Although these experiments, therefore, cannot determine the exact location of the critical  micro- and -opioid receptors, some clues can be derived from the areas that show increases in fos-like-immunoreactivity after third-ventricular administration of AgRP. Two hours after AgRP administration, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, and paraventricular and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. After 24 h, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus of the solitary tract (35). All of these regions show evidence for  micro- or -receptor binding and/or expression, but only the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral hypothalamus show high levels of binding for both receptors (33, 36, 37). Future research will need to address whether the activation of either  micro- or -receptor subtypes sufficient to produce AgRP s effects is in the same neuroanatomical sites or occurs as a result of activation in disparate sites..
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	55	A separate (but related) question is which endogenous opioid ligand or ligands that are blocked by the specific receptor antagonists have increased release after AgRP administration. The search for specific functions of opioid ligands has been hampered by the fact that they all interact with multiple subtypes of opioid receptors (20, 38) and the recent demonstration that opioid receptor subtypes can make heterodimers (39). Nevertheless, both ss-endorphin and dynorphin have high affinity for both  micro- and -opioid receptors (40, 41, 42), and ss-endorphin is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (43), in cells that have been hypothesized to express the MC3 receptor (44, 45) and in the nucleus of the solitary tract in a region of high MC4 receptor expression. Thus, it is possible that AgRP given into the third ventricle could exert direct effects on one or both of these ss-endorphin populations. Food intake stimulated by ss- endorphin can be significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by pretreatment with either the  micro- or the -selective antagonists (46, 47). As reported by Silva et al. (47), because the antagonists only worked at high equimolar doses, relative to ss-FNA, it is conceivable that they could be exerting their effects through multiple (rather than specific) opioid receptors. Because none of the antagonist doses used in the Silva study completely eliminated the ss-endorphin-induced feeding, they proposed that, analogous to our findings with AgRP, blockade of multiple opioid receptors might be necessary to produce this effect. Dynorphin is made both in the paraventricular nucleus and lateral area of the hypothalamus, and both regions express high levels of the MC4 receptor (48). Both our group and Berthoud and colleagues (35) have shown that the AgRP-induced fos in the lateral hypothalamus is colocalized with orexin-A immunoreactivity. Because dynorphin is heavily colocalized with orexin-A in the lateral hypothalamus (49), this provides direct evidence that AgRP can activate dynorphin-containing neurons. Use of either mice with targeted deletion of ss-endorphin (50, 51) or dynorphin could clarify the role of these two opioid peptides in the orexigenic actions of AgRP..

Given its large number of different receptors and ligands, however, it is likely that its role is not one-dimensional and, rather, encompasses a number of aspects of ingestive behavior (19). The present data point to a specific role for  micro- and -opioid receptors in mediating effects of the hypothalamic MC system. This intimate relationship with the MC system points to the long-term regulation of energy balance as one of the important roles played by the opioid system. Future research will need to address the functional interactions of the opioid system with hypothalamic peptides and also explore the potential involvement of the opioid system in the etiology and treatment of disorders of energy-balance regulation, such as obesity..

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Schizophrenia is associated with widespread cognitive impairments, some of which, such as those affecting memory and vigilance, have an impact upon independent living (Velligan et al, 1997). Amelioration of such impairments might improve the quality of life, therefore we studied the effects of a putative cognitive enhancer, modafinil, upon prefrontal function in people with chronic schizophrenia. Modafinil (2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulphinyl] acetamide) is a novel agent that promotes wakefulness and is licensed in the UK and USA for the treatment of narcolepsy (Cephalon, 1999; US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group, 2000; British Medical Association, 2004). Its precise mode of action is uncertain, although in animal models it has been shown to elicit `early gene' expression in anterior hypothalamus (Lin et al, 1996) and anterior cingulate cortex (Scammell et al, 2000), findings congruent with its properties. Very recently, modafinil has been reported to enhance short-term verbal memory in people with schizophrenia (Turner et al, 2004)..
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	14	   METHOD TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHOD RESULTS DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   On the basis of animal studies, we chose to probe cognitive functions that would engage `higher' executive regions, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (implicated in vigilance). However, in view of the uncertain mechanism of action of modafinil, and emerging evidence of a possible risk of psychosis exacerbation (Narendran et al, 2002), we utilised a relatively small dose of drug. Our study was conducted between 28 August 2002 and 4 July 2003..

On each day, patients received oral modafinil (100 mg) or placebo 2 h prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Administration and scanning times were predicated on the drug's pharmacokinetics in humans; peak plasma levels occur 2-4 h post-acute oral dosing (Cephalon, 1999; Robertson  and  Hellriegel, 2003). Randomisation, performed by a pharmacist (not a member of the research team), was achieved by drawing labelled counters; this ensured that approximately equivalent numbers of patients received modafinil and placebo on day 1, and vice versa on day 2. Patients were required not to smoke or consume caffeine prior to scanning. They were admitted for 24-h observation after the scanning procedure. The outcome measures were: a difference in fMRI signal, during a working memory task, between the modafinil and placebo conditions; a difference in behavioural performance (accuracy), during the same intra-scanner task, between modafinil and placebo conditions; and a patient-wise bivariate correlation between the first two measures..

This difficult task required subjects to monitor, update and temporally `tag' the contents of their working memory (Manoach, 2003). A series of numbers (between 1 and 4) was presented visually, in a pseudo-random order, one every 2 s. Colour coding of these stimuli cued patients to indicate (by pressing a button) either which number was currently presented on the screen (the `0-back'; baseline condition) or which number had been presented two trials earlier (i.e. the `2-back'; active condition). Stimuli were delivered using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc, California, USA) software running on a personal computer via a video projector and mirror located inside the scanner bore. Patients responded by pressing one of four buttons on an intra-scanner box optically connected to the computer system via an interface (New Micros Inc, Texas, USA). In an alternating, blocked 0-back/2-back design, 15 consecutive `0-back' stimuli (lasting 30 s) were followed by 15 consecutive `2-back' stimuli (also lasting 30 s).

Different performance levels have been permitted in previous studies. Some have incorporated a wide range of accuracy among patients with schizophrenia (Callicott et al, 1998, where performance was relatively poor; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 2001; Bertolino et al, 2003) whereas others have set more stringent thresholds (Callicott et al, 2000, 2003). Comparison with a healthy control group necessarily requires comparable levels of performance across the groups, but in our study we wished to compare patients' performances against themselves (on and off modafinil). Hence, we allowed for a range of performance accuracy. This was partly pragmatic, given that we were deliberately studying people with chronic schizophrenia and prominent negative symptomatology (the likely recipients of putative cognitive enhancers), but also design-led because we required a range of performance across the group to detect changes in performance within subjects exposed to modafinil (hence avoiding `ceiling effects') and to allow for post hoc correlations with performance per se (Manoach et al, 1999; Callicott et al, 2000, 2003)..

The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response that is measured by fMRI is thought to represent a vascular marker of neuronal activation (Logothetis et al, 2001). Following timing and movement correction, spatial normalisation and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half-maximum (Friston et al, 1995), we used a `boxcar' wave convolved with a synthetic haemodynamic response function to model the BOLD response. Each patient had two fMRI data-sets (modafinil and placebo); for each individual data-set, a first-level voxel-wise contrast of activation during the working memory v. baseline was undertaken. This generated contrast images, which were then used in a second-order (random-effects) group analysis..
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	30	Random-effects analyses allow quantitative inferences to be drawn regarding the average behaviour of the population from which patients are selected, across different scanning sessions. Such an analysis is mandatory in psychopharmacological designs where the main effect of interest exists only between distinct scanning sessions (i.e., modafinil v. placebo; Friston et al, 1999). Individual contrast images were entered as data points in a whole-group analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that compared brain activation during working memory v. baseline conditions on modafinil with activation during working memory v. baseline on placebo. Order of scanning (whether modafinil was received on day 1 or day 2) comprised the `nuisance' covariate. This produced a group parametric brain map of t-statistics, in the stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI; Evans et al, 1993), showing brain areas more activated during working memory than baseline conditions on modafinil compared with placebo. We emphasise that intra-session effects (working memory v. baseline) were modelled at the first level but that the main inter-session effect (modafinil v. placebo) was modelled in the second-level (random effects) analysis..

That is, of five patients who received `typicals' the majority responded positively to modafinil (both physiologically and cognitively). Conversely, of 12 patients receiving `atypicals' only one exhibited this pattern. Moreover, a post hoc analysis confirmed that the positive correlation between anterior cingulate cortex signal and performance change was most significant in the five patients receiving `typical' antipsychotics (Spearman's =1.00, P not calculated). Conversely, when these patients were excluded from the group analysis, the latter was no longer significant (for 12 patients receiving `atypicals', =0.03; one-tailed P=0.47). Exclusion of those subjects whose performance was at the level of chance on placebo led to exclusion of three of the four subjects receiving depots and a reduction of the anterior cingulate cortex/performance correlation to trend significance (=0.58; one-tailed P=0.06). Hence, it is possible that those receiving depot medication derived the greatest benefit from modafinil (perhaps as a consequence of greater initial deficit) and contributed most to the findings..

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Neural response We administered a single low dose of modafinil to people with chronic schizophrenia and assessed working memory during fMRI. Our data reveal a specific effect of the drug upon an area of the frontal lobe called the anterior cingulate cortex. Importantly, this effect was specific to the active memory condition and not the baseline state. Anterior cingulate cortex is involved in a wide range of executive functions (Bush et al, 2000) and has been activated during working memory protocols in previous studies (Callicott et al, 2000, 2003; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 2001). Its activation in people with chronic schizophrenia appears to be enhanced by modafinil (Fig. 1)..
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	61	Cognitive response Despite enhanced anterior cingulate cortex activation at the group level (during working memory performance), most of our patients did not exhibit enhanced cognition. For the group as a whole there was no effect of modafinil upon working memory (on this protocol). Therefore it might be posited that increased anterior cingulate cortex activation is either unrelated to cognition or indicative of reduced efficiency of cognitive processing (Callicott et al, 2000; Manoach, 2003). If greater anterior cingulate cortex activation occurs without an increase in cognitive performance then brain function might be said to be less efficient in the presence of modafinil. However, it is important to note that cognitive function did improve in a minority of patients, and that although it might be posited that this is to be expected statistically (as merely a manifestation of variation around the mean), there is a feature of the data that runs counter to this interpretation. This is the positive correlation between anterior cingulate cortex activation and cognitive improvement (Fig. 2). If modafinil simply made anterior cingulate cortex function less efficient, then we should expect such a correlation to be negative. The positive correlation implies that the magnitude of anterior cingulate cortex activation and cognitive performance are indeed related in the context of modafinil exposure; those exhibiting the greater anterior cingulate cortex response also exhibit the greater cognitive enhancement (of working memory)..

The numbers are small but there may be a rationale for this finding. The neurotransmitter systems implicated in the promotion of wakefulness by modafinil include the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. Although antipsychotics share antagonism of the dopaminergic system (especially at the D2 receptor), the typicals and atypicals differ in their affinities for other receptors, particularly 5HT2A (Keefe et al, 1999). In animal models modafinil's effect of increasing alertness is attenuated by 5HT2A antagonism (Shelton et al, 1995), hence, it is possible that atypical antipsychotic treatment (if antagonising 5HT2A) might constrain the cognotropic effects of modafinil (a hypothesis deserving further study). Alternatively, the ability of atypicals themselves to enhance cognition (albeit to a limited extent; Keefe et al, 1999) might curtail further improvement (on modafinil)..

First, for the reasons described, we deliberately utilised a relatively low dose of modafinil. This may have been sub-optimal. Nevertheless, one of our participants underwent psychotic relapse 4 days post-drug. We cannot determine whether modafinil was responsible. Although covert non-adherence to concurrent medication cannot be excluded (he was receiving an oral antipsychotic), we must be wary of seeking to exculpate the test medication. However, a psychotic reaction to a single dose of modafinil is unprecedented (to our knowledge), although there are cases of psychosis emerging de novo in those receiving multiple doses. The manufacturer's prescribing information reports that: `one healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of [modafinil] and sleep deprivation. There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.' (Cephalon, 1999). The British National Formulary does not mention psychosis as either a contraindication to or a consequence of modafinil exposure..

TNF has been very extensively studied47 and plays an important role in inflammation, bacterial,51 and viral infection,52 tumor cachexia, and the immune response. It is produced by a variety of cells including prominently monocytes, macrophages, and some T-cell subsets. In mice, variants in the TNF gene that affect the levels of TNF production are associated with variations in the level of susceptibility to renal disease in a lupus-like syndrome.53 Polymorphisms in the human TNF gene are associated with increased susceptibility to fatal cerebral malaria,54 rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,55 and perhaps other autoimmune disorders.56-59.

Within 15 kb upstream of the human TNF cluster is a gene designated B144 or LST-1 (leukocyte-specific transcript),66 a homologue of a partial cDNA first identified in the mouse.67 The transcript of this gene is expressed exclusively in monocytes, macrophages, and some T cells. Expression of the gene at the RNA level is increased by various activating stimuli, and in particular by -interferon (-IFN). The most probable gene product is encoded in an open reading frame whose cognate amino acid sequence is over 50% identical between humans and mouse. The amino acid sequence contains a long hydrophobic region near the N terminus but otherwise shows no apparent relationship to proteins of known function. The interpretation of the open reading frame and the regulation of this gene is complicated by the remarkable degree of alternative splicing that is seen in the mRNA products..

Exons 5 and 6 may be associated with any of the 5' exons and may be separately or jointly omitted from the final mRNA product. The result is that 24 or more forms of mRNA may be seen in U937 monocyte cells. Some of these forms could encode altered forms of the putative protein while others affect only the 5' untranslated region. The gene is also peculiar in that one spliced form apparently has a GA dinucleotide as the first bases at the 5' end of an intron. The first two bases of introns are generally GT with an occasional GC, so that the B144 splice site is highly unusual and perhaps unique. The mouse gene also seems to have multiple alternative splice forms in cultured cells. The amount of B144 mRNA in some cells is quite substantial and it would be surprising if the protein were not formed in significant amounts, although there are presently no publications characterizing the putative protein..

It is highly conserved between rodents and humans. The mRNA is upregulated by -interferon and is expressed by a subset of macrophages infiltrating allografts. The putative amino acid translation lacks a hydrophobic leader sequence. However, it has strong homology to the EF hand protein motif found in calcium binding proteins involved in neutrophil activation74 and also in a myeloid chemoattractant protein.75 Not all cytokine genes encode leader sequences and it remains possible that the AIF-1 protein may be secreted or released from injured cells.

By analogy the MHC-encoded IkBL molecule is a candidate for a regulator of inflammatory responses although it is described as being widely expressed.

The structure of the genes and predicted coding products resemble that of class I genes but they are clearly a divergent family. They are also characterized by very large first introns. The only members of the group known to be expressed as mRNA are MIC-A and B, whose genes lie telomeric to the IkBL gene and centromeric to HLA-B. The MIC-A protein is expressed and properly folded independently of 2-microglobulin and is preferentially expressed in the intestinal mucosa.86 Curiously, the transcription of MIC-A is upregulated by heat shock. Thus, the gene shares properties with the class I genes per se but has at least one functional feature that would relate it to the heat shock genes located more centromerically..

One generally expressed gene, ZNF173 or the "Acid Finger Protein," 102 has several earmarks of a transcription factor including paired zinc fingers and an acidic domain. Two other members of this family, ZNF178 and 960-205, encode proteins resembling ZNF173 but lacking the acidic domain that could potentially act as a transcriptional activator. One of these, 960-205, has a limited pattern of expression, including undefined cell types within the spleen (unpublished data, August 1995)..

Between the olfactory receptor cluster and the hemochromatosis locus (Fig 1) is the gene for yet another "orphan" protein of the immune system whose mRNA so far has been found only in the thymus (unpublished data, July 1996). It is aptly called thymus specific serine protease (TSSP). The predicted protein has a hydrophobic leader sequence, suggesting that it is either membrane bound or secreted. Because it lacks a clear internal membrane anchor sequence the latter is more likely, and it will be of some interest to immunologists to learn more of the function of this gene..

Recently an RNA transcript encoded by the FAT 9104 gene and containing sequences of one of the human MHC olfactory receptor-like genes was detected in spleen mRNA. Closer examination showed that the olfactory receptor antisense sequence was included in the probable 3' untranslated region of the novel FAT 9 transcript. (unpublished data, June 1995) This transcript putatively encodes a protein of about 130 amino acids. On Northern blots it is found predominantly in lymph nodes as compared to spleen, thymus, bone marrow, or a variety of other tissues and organs. The encoded protein does not have obvious homologies to any proteins in the database. Therefore, FAT 9 seems to represent yet another example of an MHC gene that functions specifically in the immune system..

This high degree of polymorphism is believed to be driven by selection for particular alleles in response to rapidly evolving parasites, or by kinship recognition (see below). Certain of these allelic variants influence the predisposition toward various diseases, including common autoimmune disorders. It is possible that as a particular haplotype expanded in a population, other genes with alleles that act either to protect against the environmental stress or as modifiers of some of the potential adverse effects of the particular class I and class II alleles, were also selected. For example, it is not inconceivable that a class II allele associated with early onset of a severe autoimmune disease might become associated with alleles of linked genes that themselves have a protective effect against that particular autoimmune disorder. The consequences could even include a paradoxical effect in which alleles protective against the development of a disease would be found at a higher incidence in affected individuals than in controls..

The large number of alleles for the peptide-binding regions of classical MHC surface antigen genes are commonly attributed to selection for immune resistance to parasites.1 However, kin recognition43 with potential effects on mating preferences, relative fertility, and frequency of abortions, could also favor a high level of heterozygosity and the expansion of rare alleles in the odorant determining genes of the MHC. If the peptide binding regions of the class I and class II antigens themselves are, by any mechanism, the odorant determining molecules then the above effects could contribute to the selection for diversity of these regions. In this regard, some portions of the olfactory receptor genes show a relatively high level of nonsynonymous substitutions compared with synonymous nucleotide substitutions,113,114 reminiscent of the similar phenomenon in the coding regions for the peptide binding segments of the MHC class I and class II genes, Ig-related genes,115 and in flowering plant self-incompatibility loci.116,117.

Recurrent spontaneous abortions and infertility have been reported to be associated with the sharing of HLA antigens between husband and wife, although there are also a number of negative studies125-128 and the subject is somewhat controversial. These studies are difficult because of the outbred nature of the human population and the polymorphism of the MHC. In particular, any possible synergistic or additive effect by more than one locus within the MHC would be difficult to detect in most populations. Recent investigators have suggested that different regions of the MHC may affect different aspects of fertility,125 including the suggestion that homozygosity at DR may affect fertilization and implantation while homozygosity at HLA-B may affect fetal loss.128.

Alternatively it may be due to some undefined disadvantage during pregnancy accruing to fetuses that are histocompatible with their mother. However, the reduction in homozygotic individuals has been seen even in developed countries127,128 where the current generation would not be expected to show any significant reduction of homozygotes due to fetal wastage or postnatal morbidity due to infection..

The lack of linkage disequilibrium was interpreted as evidence of an additional nonlinked locus causing the same hemochromatosis phenotype. In their follow-up studies from Australia, Jazwinska et al146 recently reported that the severest phenotype was found in patients with the ancestral haplotype, spanning the region from HLA-B through and beyond HLA-F (Fig 1). Because all of their patients were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, they suggested that there was a second modifier gene close to HFE that varied with the haplotype. In contrast, Feder et al found that in the United States hemochromatosis phenotypes associated with homozygote Cys282Tyr, heterozygote Cys282Tyr, or homozygote non-Cys282Tyr mutations could not be differentiated from each other on clinical grounds. Although the association of the Cys282Tyr mutation with hemochromatosis is a compelling argument for causation, an explanation for the non-Cys282Tyr patients is lacking. It is possible that some cases of non-Cys282Tyr hemochromatosis are caused by alternative mutations of HFE. However, proof of this awaits the cloning of the remaining 1.7 kb of the HFE cDNA and identification of alternative mutations. Curiously, a new syndrome of liver iron overload with normal transferrin saturation was recently described by Pippard147 and Moirand et al.148 This discovery adds further weight to the speculation by Feder et al that mutations of other genes may cause a clinical picture indistinguishable from hemochromatosis..

Based on the estimated incidence of hemochromatosis, the high carrier frequency, and the frequency of the Cys282Tyr mutation, it can be estimated that the Cys282Tyr mutation may be present in at least 50 to 100 million individuals.

If the rate of recombination in this region were comparable to the average rate over the genome, one would expect that 4% of meioses would result in separation of HLA-A and HFE markers. At this recombination frequency linkage disequilibrium should have dissipated over a relatively short period of time, yet it has not. Possible explanations for preservation of linkage disequilibrium through this 4-Mb region include multiple identical HFE mutations on the same haplotypic background, recent origin for the HFE mutation, recombination suppression, or perhaps simultaneous selection of HLA-A alleles such as HLA-A3 and the hemochromatosis mutation. Of these, the first two explanations are less likely. The possibility that the identical HFE mutation could occur multiple times on the same haplotypic background suggests that there might be an inherently unstable sequence in the HFE gene, such as a trinucleotide repeat that is known to expand over successive generations or a CpG dinucleotide. This is not the case. The HFE mutation that is associated with the most common haplotype, A3/B7, is the G to A transition at nucleotide 845 of the open reading frame that causes the Cys282Tyr missense mutation. Furthermore, our own work and others have shown that the mutation is very stable in families, and as yet no examples of spontaneous mutations of this type have been reported..

This diminishes the rate of disruption of the favored combinations of alleles that would result from recombination or reassortment of chromosomes in meiosis. If recombination rates were the same in all MHCs then there would be an optimal low rate of recombination sufficient to generate favorable combinations of alleles but low enough to limit the genetic burden of recombinant nonoptimal chromosomal segments.171 However, different MHC regions exhibit heterogeneous rates of recombination, controlled at least in part by sequences within the MHC itself. This permits recombination of alleles so as to generate, among others, favorable combinations in chromosomal segments that may then be relatively locked in by recombination suppression. These chromosomal segments would be advantageous and thus expanded, generating extended haplotypes that show linkage disequilibrium in the population. The same considerations could apply to the occurrence of olfactory receptor genes linked to the MHC. If class I genes in particular are determinants of odor, as reviewed above, then there might be coselection of receptors that are responsive (or nonresponsive) to the class I-determined odors..

This diminishes the rate of disruption of the favored combinations of alleles that would result from recombination or reassortment of chromosomes in meiosis. If recombination rates were the same in all MHCs then there would be an optimal low rate of recombination sufficient to generate favorable combinations of alleles but low enough to limit the genetic burden of recombinant nonoptimal chromosomal segments.171 However, different MHC regions exhibit heterogeneous rates of recombination, controlled at least in part by sequences within the MHC itself.

However, there are at least some cases where the evidence is strong that non-class II genes of the MHC also play a role in the predisposition to autoimmunity. The identification of additional genes in this region that modify the propensity for autoimmune diseases could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In recent years analyses of MHC encoded transcripts has shown that there are within the MHC more than 10 different structurally diverse families of genes whose patterns of expression indicate a specific role in the immune system. The number of different MHC genes functioning in the immune response and the extensive regions of linkage disequilibrium seen in some instances in the MHC make it particularly difficult to use positional genetic approaches to assign disease contributions to particular gene products. Short of understanding the regulation and function of each protein at a level such that the effect of amino acid or nucleotide sequence variations could be predicted, perhaps the best genetic approach is to look for sense changes in codons or variation in known promoter elements for each gene, and then test in large populations to see if there is any correlation with disease manifestations independent of their disequilibrium with the class II genes. This could be very difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which is the extensive degree of linkage disequilibrium and the consequent occurrence of extended haplotypes in this region..

This nomenclature is confusing because it had been previously dubbed "HFE" years ago in anticipation of its discovery, and "HLA-H" had already been used to designate an MHC class I gene several years earlier that mapped between HLA-A and HLA-G.

Orexins stimulate LH secretion in steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats and suppress LH secretion in nonprimed ovariectomized rats. The aim of the present study was to characterize the neuroanatomical pathway by which orexin might modulate LH secretion in the rat. Using double- and triple-label immunofluorescence coupled with confocal microscopy, we found that 75 to 85% of GnRH neurons were contacted by orexin fibers, and triple labeling with synaptophysin provided additional confirmation of close contacts. Furthermore, about 85% of GnRH neurons were colocalized with the orexin receptor 1 (OX-R1), and the OX-R1-expressing GnRH neurons were contacted by orexin terminals, providing the basis for a functional neuroanatomical pathway. GnRH nerve terminals in the median eminence, however, do not express OX-R1. An additional study investigated the coexpression of neuropeptide Y Y4-like receptors and orexin fibers in relation to GnRH neurons. There is evidence that Y4 receptor stimulation results in LH release, and studies from our laboratory show Y4-like immunoreactivity in the majority of orexin cell bodies in the lateral hypothalamic area and some orexin fibers scattered throughout the hypothalamus. The present study found that, although Y4-positive orexin fibers are in present in the area of GnRH neurons, they never come in close contact with GnRH neurons. Together, these data suggest that Y4 receptor modulation of LH release is likely to be indirect through orexin cell bodies and that orexin modulates GnRH neurons directly via OX-R1..

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	4	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   THE NEUROPEPTIDES OREXIN A and orexin B, also known as hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2, have recently been characterized (1, 2) and implicated in the regulation of arousal states, energy metabolism, and neuroendocrine reproductive function (for reviews see Refs. 3, 4, 5). The peptides are derived from a common precursor, and their expression has been identified in neuronal cell bodies of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Although orexin-expressing cell bodies are restricted to this area, they send widespread projections throughout the brain and spinal cord. Orexin actions are mediated via G protein-coupled receptors of two different subtypes (OX-R1 and OX-R2). OX-R2 is a nonselective receptor that binds both orexin A and B, and OX-R1 is highly selective for orexin-A (2). Complementary to the widespread projections of orexin fibers (6), OX-R1 and OX-R2 mRNA and protein have been found widely expressed in the brain (7, 8, 9, 10)..
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	5	Recent physiological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that orexin A may play an important role in control of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis. For example, it has been shown that central administration of orexin A stimulates LH secretion (11). However, similar to other orexigenic peptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin has been shown to have bimodal effects on LH secretion, with orexin stimulating LH secretion in steroid-primed ovariectomized rats but inhibiting LH secretion in the absence of ovarian steroids (11, 12). It has also been demonstrated that immunoneutralization of orexin A in the brain completely abolishes both LH and PRL surges, but icv administration of orexin leads to a dose-dependent recovery of fasting-suppressed LH surges (13). In addition, tissue explant studies have shown that orexin A stimulates GnRH release from the hypothalamus of both intact male rats and female rats at proestrus (14). Recently a study employing low-dose estrogen replacement in ovariectomized rats, resulting in serum levels similar to those observed in diestrus, demonstrated that low-dose estrogen potentiates the suppressive effects of centrally administered orexin A on LH secretion (15), suggesting that orexin A is inhibitory during diestrus, or low estrogen states, and excitatory during surge conditions. Although orexin is clearly implicated in the regulation of GnRH/LH secretion, the neuroanatomical pathway by which orexin may be mediating its effects in the rat remains to be determined. The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether orexin fibers project to and come in close contact with GnRH neurons and whether GnRH neurons express OX-R1 in the rat..

Recently our laboratory reported that the majority of orexin cell bodies in the LHA expressed Y4-like immunoreactivity (Y4-ir), and some orexin fibers also were positive for Y4-ir (19). Others have shown that activation of Y4 receptors with a Y4 agonist, 1229U91, or a high-affinity ligand for the Y4 receptor, rat pancreatic polypeptide (rPP), stimulates GnRH neurons and in turn LH release in intact male rats (20) and is important in the basal release of LH in the female rat (17). Conversely, when the infertile, leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is crossed with the Y4 knockout mouse, fertility is partially restored, suggesting the Y4 receptor is involved in suppressing reproductive function (21). Taken together, these data suggest that some of the effects of Y4 activation on LH release may be mediated via orexin. Therefore, the second aim of the present study was to characterize the neuroanatomical relationship between Y4-positive orexin fibers and GnRH neurons..

In the triple-label IF for GnRH/orexin/Y4, there were only a few scattered Y4-positive orexin fibers in the area of GnRH neurons..

Sections from four brains were analyzed (more than 500 GnRH neurons), and the results showed that between 75% and 85% of GnRH neurons in each brain were contacted by orexin fibers, and no differences were observed between male and female animals. Using synaptophysin (a protein localized in synaptic vesicles) as a marker of synaptic contacts, orexin fiber butons colocalized with synaptophysin and were associated with GnRH neurons (Fig. 1, D to F). Shown as a stack of images (D) or individual optical slices (0.25  microm resolution, E and F), the spine of an orexin fiber (red) colocalized with synaptophsyin (blue) makes close contact with a GnRH neuron (white represents triple labeling). Additional double-label studies showed that GnRH neurons colocalized with OX-R1-ir (indicated by the yellow color in the low- and high-power examples in Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with the robust innervation of GnRH neurons by orexin, OX-R1-ir was colocalized in 85  plus or minus  2% of the GnRH neurons examined (485 neurons in five brains). Triple-label IF confirmed that orexin fibers, shown in blue, made contacts onto GnRH neurons expressing OX-R1-ir (Fig. 2, C and D)..

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	36	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The present study provides evidence for a functional neuroanatomical pathway between the orexin system and GnRH neurons in the rat, in that GnRH neurons express the OX-R1 and are contacted by orexin fibers (Figs. 1 and 2). There appears to be no interaction between orexin fibers and GnRH nerve terminals in the ME (Fig. 3). The immunoreactivity of orexin fibers and OX-R1 presented in the present study confirms previous findings demonstrating that orexin A immunoreactive fibers (6), OX-R1 mRNA (7), and immunoreactivity (9) are present in the septal and medial preoptic regions in which GnRH neurons are located. Our data support previously reported findings in the ovine hypothalamus, in which orexin fibers, originating from the LHA, were found in close contact with GnRH neurons (25). However, although the present study found between 75% and 85% of GnRH neurons contacted by orexin fibers and approximately 85% of GnRH neurons expressed OX-R1, the previous study found contacts on only 30% of GnRH neurons. This discrepancy between the two studies may be due to several things, including species differences between the rodent and sheep. If this is the case, it will be important to investigate orexin innervation of GnRH neurons in other species, especially the primate. Another discrepancy may be due to differences in the sensitivity of the antibodies used in the two studies, which were obtained from different sources. The present study shows dense networks of fine immunoreactive fibers (Figs. 1A and 4), but the orexin fibers demonstrated in the ovine hypothalamus (25) were much less dense. Yet another discrepancy might be due to differences in the sensitivity of the confocal microscopy analysis. It is generally accepted that, although confocal microscopy can provide a good approximation of synaptic interactions, the limitations of the technique preclude the degree of certainty obtained using electron microscopy..

In addition to a number of studies indicating steroid-dependent effects of central orexin administration on LH release (11, 12, 15), studies using in vitro explants indicate that the stimulatory effects of orexin are at the hypothalamic level (14). It was also reported that orexin A stimulates GnRH release from hypothalamic explants collected from both male rats and female rats in proestrus. These data suggest that the stimulatory effects of orexin on LH release are via direct stimulation of GnRH secretion. Indeed, the present findings provide the functional neuroanatomical pathway by which orexin may stimulate GnRH neurons and subsequent LH release via direct contact with OX-R1 on GnRH cell bodies but not on nerve terminals within the ME. OX-R1 is exclusively coupled to the Gq/11 subtype of G proteins (5, 26), suggesting that orexin action via the OX-R1 on GnRH neurons is excitatory. However, orexin has also been shown to inhibit LH secretion in the absence of gonadal steroids (12), although the mechanism by which gonadal steroids modulate orexin effects on LH secretion remains to be determined. It is possible that the inhibitory actions of orexin on GnRH neurons is indirect, involving the activation of other neurons within the preoptic area that also express OX-R1 (Fig. 2), which in turn may have inhibitory actions on GnRH neurons..

The central injection of orexin A stimulates food intake in satiated rats (27, 28), whereas neutralization of orexin with an antiorexin antibody dose dependently suppresses spontaneous feeding in fasted rats (29). Furthermore, orexin mRNA is increased with fasting (2). These data suggest that orexin neurons are able to sense the nutritional state of an animal. It has been shown repeatedly that changes in the metabolic status of an animal are tightly linked to changes in reproductive function. Therefore, the ability of orexin to modulate both feeding behavior and reproductive function, along with the present neuroanatomical findings, suggests that the orexin system is in a key position to serve as an integrating signal between energy balance and reproductive function..

Leptin, a peripheral metabolic signal released from adipocytes, is important in denoting adiposity and energy balance to the brain. Also, leptin has been shown to play a role in regulating reproductive function. Administration of leptin restores fasting-induced suppression of LH secretion in both sheep and primates (31, 32, 33). However, GnRH neurons do not express Ob-Rb. As previously suggested by similar findings in the ovine hypothalamus (25), direct projections by Ob-Rb-expressing orexin neurons to GnRH neurons may provide one potential neuroanatomical circuit by which leptin regulates GnRH activity..

Similar to the effects of orexin, NPY also elicits steroid-dependent effects on LH secretion (35). Orexin neurons in the LHA receive direct synaptic contacts by NPY neurons projecting from the arcuate nucleus and in turn send reciprocal projections to arcuate nucleus NPY neurons (36). Currently, there is evidence implicating the Y1 (16, 17, 18), Y4 (17, 19, 20, 21), and Y5 (22, 23) receptor subtypes in NPY s modulation of neuroendocrine reproductive function. Of direct relevance, Y4-ir and mRNA are colocalized with orexin neurons in the LHA (19). These data, coupled with the present findings that GnRH neurons express the OX-R1 and are contacted by orexin fibers, demonstrate a unique potential neuronal circuit whereby NPY, acting through the Y4 receptor, can exert its effects on LH release via the modulation of orexin. Because the present study also showed that Y4-positive orexin fibers were never observed in close contact with GnRH neurons, the major actions of the Y4 receptor appear to be through postsynaptic effects on orexin cell bodies within the LHA. Taken together, these data suggest that orexin neurons, by receiving critical input via Y4 and leptin receptors, may provide an important link between the regulation of energy balance and reproductive function..

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	45	A number of questions remain concerning the modulatory effects of the Y4-orexin system on GnRH neurons. First, the endogenous ligand for the brain Y4 receptor is not clear. Is it NPY, which has a much lower affinity for the Y4 receptor (37), or other pancreatic polypeptide family ligands? Our recent study characterizing the expression of Y4-ir on orexin neurons also found that administration of rPP, an endogenous ligand of the Y4 receptor, induced robust cFos activation in orexin neurons (19). Furthermore, rPP stimulated a modest increase in food intake and a robust drinking response (19), which is similar to responses by orexin. These data suggest that stimulation of the Y4 receptor by rPP is excitatory to orexin neurons. However, the effects of Y4 on reproductive function have been shown to be both stimulatory (17, 20) and inhibitory (21). Similarly, the effects of orexin have been reported to be both stimulatory and inhibitory to reproductive function (11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Therefore, it is possible the actions of the Y4 receptor on the GnRH/LH axis are mediated via the orexin system..

The lack of CCK-AR in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats results in hyperphagia and obesity. We have suggested that demonstrated increases in meal size and elevated levels of dorsomedial hypothalamic (DMH) neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene expression may contribute to this phenotype. In contrast to OLETF rats, CCK-AR to / to  mice have normal total daily food intake and do not develop obesity. To assess the basis underlying the different phenotypes in rats and mice lacking CCK-AR, we characterized meal patterns in CCK-AR to / to  mice and determined whether CCK-AR to / to  mice exhibited an alteration in DMH NPY gene expression. We demonstrate that although CCK-AR to / to  mice show a similar dysregulation in meal size as OLETF rats, they do not have an elevation in DMH NPY mRNA expression levels. In fact, intact mice have no CCK-AR in the DMH. Furthermore, in intact rats, NPY and CCK-AR are colocalized in DMH neurons, and parenchymal injection of CCK into the DMH reduces food intake and down-regulates DMH NPY mRNA expression. These results suggest that although CCK-AR plays a role in the mediation of CCK actions in the control of meal size in both rats and mice, CCK-AR seems to contribute to modulating DMH NPY levels only in rats. The deficit in CCK s action in the control of DMH NPY gene expression may play a major role in the obese phenotype in OLETF rats..

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	5	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   CHOLECYSTOKININ (CCK) IS a peptide that is found in both the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. CCK is released from the duodenum and jejunum in response to the intraluminal presence of nutrient-digestive products, and it has been proposed to serve a feedback function in the short-term control of food intake. Peripheral CCK administration reduces food intake in a dose-related manner across a range of experimental situations and in a variety of species (1, 2, 3, 4), and the actions of CCK in food intake are specific to a reduction in meal size (5). The feeding inhibitory effects of exogenously administered CCK appear to mimic a physiological role for endogenous CCK. Administration of CCK antagonists results in an increase in food intake (6, 7, 8, 9), and this increase is manifested as an increase in meal size (10, 11). The feeding inhibitory actions of both exogenously administered and endogenously released CCK are mediated through their interaction with CCK-A (or CCK-1) receptors (CCK-AR) (7)..

Initial work reported that continuous picomole infusions of CCK into the cerebral ventricles of sheep suppressed feeding (12), but results in rodent models have been mixed. Although some studies have identified feeding inhibitory actions of central ventricular CCK administration, issues of dosage and access to peripheral sites have been raised (13, 14). Recently, Blevins et al. demonstrated that infusing smaller doses of CCK-8 into specific brain sites resulted in site-specific feeding inhibitory actions in the rat (15), and this anorexic dose of CCK-8 did not increase plasma CCK-8 levels sufficiently to suppress feeding by a peripheral mechanism (16)..

OLETF rats have a peripheral CCK satiety deficit. These rats have no feeding response to peripherally exogenous CCK administration (20). Consistent with the lack of an intact peripheral CCK satiety signaling, food intake in OLETF rats is characterized by significant and chronic increases in meal sizes. In response to this increase, meal number is decreased, but the decrease is not compensatory, and as a result, OLETF rats are hyperphagic (20). Although the increase in meal size in OLETF rats is consistent with the absence of peripheral CCK signaling, the overall hyperphagia and obesity were surprising. Pair-feeding OLETF rats to the intake of Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats completely prevents their obesity, demonstrating that the increased body weight is secondary to the hyperphagia and does not depend on metabolic alterations. Pair-feeding not only prevented the increased body weight, but also normalized the elevated levels of leptin and insulin and the alterations in arcuate nucleus neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in OLETF rats (21). Pair-feeding also revealed what seems to be a primary deficit in dorsomedial hypothalamic (DMH) NPY mRNA expression in OLETF rats. DMH NPY mRNA expression was significantly elevated in pair-fed, normal weight OLETF rats, and this elevation was also found in 5-wk-old preobese OLETF rats (21). We have suggested that this dysregulation of DMH NPY gene expression may, in combination with the peripheral satiety deficit, contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats (21)..

Although these mice were insensitive to the feeding inhibitory action of peripheral exogenous CCK, this deficit did not appear to affect their overall food intake.

The test cages contained feeding devices (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA), which delivered 20-mg chow pellets. The pellet dispensers were controlled by infrared pellet-sensing photo beams (Med Associates, Inc., Georgia, VT). Individual pellets were delivered in response to removal of the previous pellet. Animals had ad libitum access to pellets and water. Animals were adapted to the testing apparatus and feeding paradigm for 10 d before experimental data collection. By this point, pellet spillage had decreased to less than 10/d. Data were recorded 24 h/d on a computer. A meal was defined as the acquisition of at least five pellets, preceded and followed by at least 10 min of no feeding (23). Meal size was defined as the number of pellets delivered during a meal. Data for the dark cycle, light cycle, and total 24 h for the variables of total intake, meal size, and meal frequency were saved on a computer and analyzed with Tongue Twister software (version 1.42; Dr. T.

Coronal sections (14  microm) were cut via a cryostat, mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The full length of rat CCK-AR cDNA (24) was synthesized by RT-PCR, subcloned into pcDNA1 vector, and linearized by an appropriate restriction enzyme. The antisense or sense riboprobe of CCK-AR was labeled with [35S]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) using in vitro transcription systems (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). As previously described (25), the 35S-labeled antisense riboprobe of NPY was transcribed from rat NPY precursor cDNA (26). Standard in situ hybridization was conducted. Brian sections over the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and DMH regions (0.58 to 2.06 mm caudal to bregma) (27) were selected for examining CCK-AR mRNA expression. As well, brain sections over the DMH region (1.70 to 2.06 mm caudal to bregma) (27) were selected for examining NPY mRNA expression. Sections were treated with acetic anhydride and incubated in the standard hybridization buffer containing 108 cpm/ml 35S-labeled probe overnight. The incubation temperature was set at 55 C for NPY and 58 C for CCK-AR probe. After the hybridization, the sections were washed three times with 2x standard saline citrate (SSC), treated with 20  microg/ml ribonuclease A (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) at 37 C for 30 min, rinsed in 2x SSC twice at 55 C for NPY or 58 C for CCK-AR, and finally washed twice in 0.1x SSC at 55 C for NPY or 58 C for CCK-AR for 15 min each time.

Adult male wild-type littermates of the CCK-AR to / to  mice were killed by decapitation, and brains were removed and rapidly frozen in isopentane at  to 70 C. Coronal sections (20  microm) over the PVN (0.58 to 1.22 mm caudal to bregma) and DMH regions (1.46 to 2.06 mm caudal to bregma) were cut via a cryostat and mounted on cold gelatin-coated slides (27). To differentiate between CCK-AR and CCK-BR, we compared the ability of the CCK-AR antagonist devazepide and the CCK-BR agonist desulfated CCK-8 (dCCK) to displace the binding site of 125I-labeled CCK-8. If the binding was inhibited by devazepide, but not by dCCK, the binding was occurring to CCK-AR. In contrast, if the binding was inhibited by dCCK, but not by devazepide, the binding was occurring to CCK-BR. Thus, after preincubation in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% BSA for 20 min at 24 C, slides were incubated in the standard binding buffer containing 50 pM [125I]Bolton-Hunter-labeled CCK-8 (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) for 2 h at 24 C, either alone or in the presence of 10 nM devazepide, 100 nM dCCK, or 100  microM sulfated CCK-8.

We previously demonstrated that OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR have a deficit in their ability to limit the size of spontaneous meals and a disruption in the regulation of NPY mRNA expression in the DMH. We have suggested that both of these alterations may contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity of OLETF rats (19). The current results demonstrate that CCK-AR to / to  mice also have altered meal patterns. However, in contrast to the OLETF rat, overall food intake is not affected in CCK-AR to / to  mice. Thus, although both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR demonstrate a deficit in peripheral CCK satiety actions leading to increased meal size, their overall control of food intake and energy balance appears to differ. Assessment of the distribution of CCK-AR in the mouse brain revealed no CCK-AR binding activity and no CCK-AR mRNA expression in the DMH in normal mice. Previous work has consistently shown that the rat DMH contains CCK-AR (28, 34, 35).

Peripheral CCK produces dose-related suppression of meal size and results in the earlier appearance of a behavioral satiety sequence (11). These actions of the exogenous peptide appear to mimic a physiological role of endogenous CCK, because administration of CCK antagonists results in an increase in food intake. The feeding inhibitory actions of both exogenously administered and endogenously released CCK depend upon actions at the CCK-AR. CCK-mediated inhibition of food intake is blocked by CCK-AR antagonists, but is unaffected by CCK-BR antagonists (7). The current finding of increased meal size in CCK-AR to / to  mice demonstrates an action of endogenous CCK in the control of meal size in mice that is consistent with prior data on antagonists and our previous findings in the OLETF rat that also lacks CCK-AR (10, 11, 20). Thus, these data provide additional molecular biological support for a physiological role for endogenous CCK in the short-term control of food intake. The magnitude of the change in meal size in CCK-AR to / to  mice was quite a bit smaller than the 80% increase found in OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR.

Although this may reflect a differential ability to compensate for smaller rather than larger increases in meal size, the present data also suggest that this difference in phenotype may be the outcome of a different distribution of brain CCK-AR between rats and mice. The potential importance of this differential distribution derives from the findings that in intact rats, NPY and CCK-AR are colocalized in DMH neurons, and CCK plays a role in modulating DMH NPY; exogenous administration of CCK into the DMH down-regulates DMH NPY mRNA expression. These results are consistent our previous findings demonstrating that NPY gene expression is up-regulated in the DMH in OLETF rats that lack CCK-AR (21).

This elevation of NPY mRNA expression in the DMH was also documented in young preobese OLETF rats (21). Therefore, CCK acting through CCK-ARs in the DMH appears to suppress DMH NPY gene expression in the rat. Such a suppression inhibits energy intake, in that DMH CCK injection reduces food intake.

DMH NPY mRNA expression in ad libitum-fed rats is normally low and is only elevated in a few experimental situations, such as lactation (36) or in response to chronic food restriction (25). In the rat there are clear differences in the controls of DMH and arcuate nucleus NPY-expressing neurons. In the arcuate nucleus, NPY-containing neurons express Ob-RB, the long form of leptin receptors, and NPY expression is under leptin control (37). Elevated leptin levels reduce NPY mRNA expression, whereas food deprivation increases arcuate NPY gene expression. In contrast, DMH NPY-containing neurons do not express leptin receptors, and DMH NPY mRNA expression does not increase in response to acute food deprivation (25). Moreover, within the DMH, the region of altered NPY expression in response to a variety of treatments appears to differ. The current data demonstrating that the reduction of DMH NPY expression by CCK is localized to the compact subregion are consistent with our previous findings (21, 25). Whereas in lactating rats, Smith (36) had reported that although there was a very slight increase in NPY mRNA expression in the compact area, DMH NPY mRNA expression was mainly induced in the diffuse portion of the DMH. However, it is not yet clear whether NPY mRNA expression in different subregions of the DMH is differentially regulated. Controls of DMH NPY expression in the mouse have not been extensively investigated.

Pair-feeding experiments, in which one group of sham-operated rats was pair-fed by a computerized feeding system that presented food pellets in the same amount and pattern as their "yoked" DMHL rats, demonstrated that the altered body weight in DMHL rats was primarily a result of altered food intake (42). Despite findings such as these, the particular contribution of the DMH and how it interacts with other hypothalamic nuclei involved in energy balance has not been well understood.

However, such additional genetic defects are yet to be identified..
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	65	We have interpreted the current data to support the view that the different phenotypes of OLETF rats and CCK to / to  mice derive from a differential role for central CCK-AR in energy balance in rats and mice. OLETF rats are not a targeted deletion of CCK-AR, but arose a spontaneous mutation. It is quite possible that there are other genetic alterations in the OLETF rat that alone or in combination with the alterations in CCK-AR signaling account for the hyperphagia, obesity, or diabetes (49). However, such additional genetic defects are yet to be identified..
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	66	In summary, the present results suggest that although both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR demonstrate a deficit in meal size control, the differential distribution of CCK-AR in rat and mouse brains may determine the divergent effects of CCK-AR gene disruption. In the rat brain, CCK acting through CCK-AR appears to play a role in regulating DMH NPY gene expression. DMH CCK inhibits NPY mRNA expression and food intake. In the absence of CCK-AR, OLETF rats have a deficit in the control of DMH NPY gene expression, resulting in increased DMH NPY gene expression, increased food intake, and, eventually, obesity. In contrast, we found no evidence for the presence of CCK-AR in the DMH of the mouse. Thus, CCK-AR does not contribute to the control of DMH NPY gene expression, and in the absence of this central deficit, mice lacking CCK-AR are able to compensate for the absence of CCK satiety signaling and do not become hyperphagic and obese..

We hypothesized that candidate genes can be prioritized by their expression levels in tissues of central importance in obesity. Our objective was to develop a combined bioinformatics and molecular paradigm to identify novel genes as candidates for murine or human obesity genetic modifiers based on their differential expression patterns in the hypothalamus compared with other murine tissues. We used bioinformatics tools to search publicly available gene expression databases using criteria designed to identify novel genes differentially expressed in the hypothalamus. We used RNA methods to determine their expression sites and levels of expression in the hypothalamus of the murine brain. We identified the chromosomal location of the novel genes in mice and in humans and compared these locations with those of genetic loci predisposing to obesity-related traits. We developed a search strategy that correctly identified a set of genes known to be important in hypothalamic function as well as a candidate gene for Prader-Willi syndrome that was not previously identified as differentially expressed in the hypothalamus. Using this same strategy, we identified and characterized a set of 11 genes not previously known to be differentially expressed in the murine hypothalamus.

The hypothalamus is a complex region of the brain involved in homeostatic processes including, but not limited to, energy balance. We identified a set of genes already known to be important to hypothalamic function and a set of genes not previously associated with the hypothalamus. We propose that these genes may be important in the function of the hypothalamus, may provide a new source of hypothalamus-specific regulatory elements, and may be important in disorders of hypothalamic function, such as obesity. Furthermore, genes identified in this search are now candidate genes for obesity-related traits genetically mapped to the chromosomal intervals in which they reside..

The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) murine gene expression atlas (now updated to GNF SymAtlas version 1.0.3) was originally developed as a tool for high-throughput analysis of transcriptional activity in biological samples (25, 26). The expression of specific genes within 45 diverse murine tissues, including the hypothalamus, was quantified by hybridization to Affymetrix mouse (U74A) high-density oligonucleotide arrays and made available as a searchable, on-line database. We filtered the murine dataset to select genes with levels of expression above the median in the hypothalamus but with a moderately high level of expression above the median in no more than five other tissues. According to the GNF SymAtlas database, duplicate samples and/or duplicate hybridizations were performed for each tissue, and these values are integrated into the error bars for each measurement. Because of the configuration of the database, it is not possible to generate estimates of statistical significance; rather, the search criteria were left deliberately broad at the risk of including some genes that do not in fact show as much specificity for hypothalamic expression when analyzed further as might be expected from the database search alone. The median is defined for the specific gene, across all tissues, so that there is no bias against genes that have low to moderate levels of gene expression overall. This first search was performed on the GeneAtlas Version 1 Dataset (25). A second search was performed on the GeneAtlas Version 2 Dataset, Mouse GeneAtlas GNF1M (26). In this data set, a correlation search was performed to identify genes with a high value in the hypothalamus (set at 400), any value in nonbrain tissues, and a low value (set at 1) in other regions of the brain, with a correlation of 0.98. Because the preoptic region is part of the hypothalamus, we allowed any value for expression in the preoptic area as well. Genome localization for selected murine hypothalamic genes was identified from the May 2004 mouse (Mus musculus) draft genome data, build 33 assembly by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomic localization of human orthologs was deduced using NCBI database UniGene and Gene..

RNA in situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes on 20- microm cryosections of embryonic day 18.5 mouse embryos as previously described (16). Probes for Hcrt, A26100, Dscr1l2, Impact, and Pnck were derived from PCR fragments amplified from reverse-transcribed adult mouse hypothalamus mRNA with recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned into a pBluescript vector (Invitrogen). The Hcrt probe includes positions 7 to 573 of hypocretin (Hcrt) mRNA (NM_010410). The A26100 probe includes positions 432 to 1,004 of RIKEN cDNA 2610042L04 gene (2610042L04Rik) mRNA (NM_025940). The Dscr1l2 probe includes positions 177 to 638 of Down syndrome critical region gene 1-like 2 (Dscr1l2) mRNA (NM_022980). The Impact probe includes positions 504 to 955 of imprinted and ancient (Impact) mRNA (NM_008378). The Pnck probe includes positions 697 to 1,252 of pregnancy upregulated nonubiquitously expressed Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (Pnck) mRNA (NM_012040). The Magel2 probe includes positions 984 to 1,754 of Genbank accession number NM_013779 and was previously described (16).

By clustering the ESTs into groups (UniGene clusters) by sequence identity, the resulting UniGene database could be queried with a gene name to discover the tissues in which the gene is expressed. Until recently, there were no public databases that allowed investigators to perform the converse query, which is to discover the expression levels of all the transcripts in a particular tissue with respect to their expression levels in other tissues. However, the results of two large-scale gene array experiments documenting expression levels of most genes in a wide range of mouse tissues, including the hypothalamus, have recently been published. Specifically, labeled cDNA from each mouse tissue was hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip microarrays to profile expression levels of 36,000 genes in those tissues. In this study, multitissue comparisons were performed to normalize expression levels and input into a searchable gene expression database (the GNF database) made available by the Novartis Research Foundation (8, 25). The major advantage over previous studies, which used subtractive methods to derive hypothalamic cDNAs, is that levels of expression can be compared between tissues and between parts of the brain, so that genes expressed more highly or more specifically in the hypothalamus can be easily identified. We queried this database to identify genes differentially expressed in the murine adult hypothalamus..

We reasoned that genes important in hypothalamic development or function are likely to be transcribed in hypothalamic precursor tissues or the mature hypothalamus. The laboratory mouse is a model particularly amenable to studies of brain function because of similarities in anatomy to the human hypothalamus and because of its widespread use in obesity studies. We performed three searches using different criteria to query the GNF expression database for genes highly expressed in the postnatal murine hypothalamus. Our first search of the GNF database used low-specificity criteria that required only high expression in the hypothalamus, of at least 8 times the median of the expression level in all 45 mouse tissues. This search identified a set of genes already studied for their role in hypothalamic function, such as pro-opiomelanocortin- (POMC) and Hcrt, but also identified many genes broadly expressed in the nervous system, such as the microtubule-associated protein-. Notably, some genes important in obesity and/or hypothalamic function were not identified under these conditions (e.g., the widely expressed Nhlh2). Our second search of the GNF database used high-specificity criteria as that for the first search, high expression in the hypothalamus of at least eight times the median of the expression in other tissues. In addition, the second search required low expression ( < 3 times the median) in at least 40 other tissues. This second search identified five genes including arginine vasopressin, POMC, Hcrt, and oxytocin, all of which have major roles in endocrine regulation in the hypothalamus. Significantly, this high-specificity search also identified Magel2, which is developmentally regulated and inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. We then formulated a third search with intermediate specificity: expression in the hypothalamus over eight times the median level of all tissues and fewer than five tissues with over three times the median level of expression. The third search of the GNF database identified a set of 15 genes highly expressed in the hypothalamus but moderately to highly expressed in only 5 other murine tissues (Table 1, screen 1). We repeated the third search using an updated database, the 2004 version of the mouse Geneatlas. As with the third search of the GNF database, the search of Geneatlas 2004 identified genes with high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression elsewhere in the brain. We then used the correlation function of the searchable Symatlas database within Geneatlas. The Symatlas search was refined to allow either high or low expression in the preoptic region, which functionally overlaps with the hypothalamus. This last search, still using intermediate specificity criteria, identified 7 genes, 3 of which were identified in the GNF intermediate-specificity search (Table 1, screen 2), for a total of 19 genes..

Because the nature of the search engine provided by GNF changed from the 2002 release to the 2004 release, the two search criteria were not directly comparable. In common between the two searches was the requirement for high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression in other regions of the brain. Because we were interested in identifying genes not known to be important in the hypothalamus, we first set aside genes whose role in hypothalamic function has been well described. These included genes encoding the neuropeptide signaling molecules Hcrt/orexin, pro-opiomelanocortin-, oxytocin, agouti-related protein, and arginine vasopressin (4). A neuroendocrine role for calcitonin and the calcitonin receptor in growth hormone secretion in the hypothalamus/pituitary had previously been suggested (17). We had previously identified Magel2 as specifically expressed in the developing murine hypothalamus, although its function in this tissue is not yet known (16). Magel2 is of particular interest because its human ortholog, MAGEL2, is one of a set of genes inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (9, 15). Finally, mutations in Patched (Ptch1) can result in holoprosencephaly and developmental delay in humans or, alternatively, cause basal cell nervous syndrome when homozygously inactivated in somatic cells. Ptch1 is an antagonist of the signaling molecule hedgehog, which functions in patterning of the neural tube but is not known to have a specific role in the hypothalamus..

The remaining 11 genes fell into 2 categories: 1) novel genes for which a function has been predicted by sequence similarity to known genes and 2) novel genes with no known function and no or limited similarity to known genes (Table 2). We examined the UniGene clusters associated with these novel genes. Because EST sets made from hypothalamus RNA are represented in mouse EST databases, we expected to see a representation of hypothalamic cDNAs within the Unigene clusters corresponding to these genes. Indeed, all 11 genes had corresponding ESTs derived from the whole brain, with some specifically including the hypothalamus (4) or diencephalon (2) (Table 2). The information in the UniGene clusters did not point to these genes being particularly hypothalamus specific, in contrast to the Unigene cluster for arginine vasopressin, for example, in which 12 of the 19 ESTs were derived from the hypothalamus. We then used the EST ProfileViewer function in Unigene to test whether the expression profile derived from ESTs overlapped with that derived from the Geneatlas databases. Seven of the eleven novel genes had a major contribution of ESTs from the brain or pituitary gland; the hypothalamus was included as a "brain" sample in the EST Profile viewer. In one case (Itih3), the majority of UniGene ESTs were derived from the liver, with a small minority from the brain. This is consistent with the Geneatlas distribution, which shows the highest expression of Itih3 in the liver, with most of the remaining expression in preoptic and hypothalamus samples. In one other case (Dscr1l2), the UniGene ESTs did not distribute into any tissue-specific pattern, although an examination of the developmental timing of expression, also using the function in Unigene, demonstrated that the vast majority of ESTs were derived from the egg as opposed to preimplantation embryos or any postimplantation embryonic stage. This is in contrast to the GeneAtlas 2004 expression profile, which shows very little tissue specificity for the Dscr1l2 transcript, and also contrasts with the GeneAtlas 2002 expression profile, which showed more specific expression in the hypothalamus. Similarly, the Pitpnm1 showed conflicting expression profiles between the GeneAtlas 2002, GeneAtlas 2004, and EST ProfileViewer, with the one commonality being expression in the eye..

It had been proposed that Igsf1 (also known as InhBP/p120) may be involved in pituitary function, but both male and female mice mutant for Igsf1 are viable and fertile (3). The insulin receptor substrates, including Irs4, function in insulin signaling. Absence of Irs4 causes mild defects in growth, reproduction, and glucose homeostasis in an Irs4-null mutant mouse line (5). On the basis of a mouse knockout model, Ptprz was shown to have a role in oligodendrocyte survival and in recovery from demyelinating disease (11). Pnck (6), Nsg1 (21), and Ptpro (2) have been suggested to have roles in the developing nervous system; whereas the function of Itih3 has been studied in the liver, no function has been predicted in the brain (2). No function has been predicted for Impact, although the human ortholog IMPACT has been suggested as a candidate gene for bipolar affective disorder (10, 14).

We first verified that the 11 selected genes were indeed expressed in the murine hypothalamus by RT-PCR on RNA samples from the adult mouse hypothalamus (data not shown). We then localized the expression to specific hypothalamic nuclei by RNA in situ hybridization using a standard mouse atlas to label the sections (13). A probe for Hcrt displayed a strong signal in the lateral anterior hypothalamus, consistent with the known abundance of RNA transcripts in this region of the brain (Fig. 1) (27). Consistent with the earlier embryonic expression of Magel2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (16), we detected Magel2 transcripts in the anterior hypothalamus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (Fig. 1). We then selected four genes that emerged from the bioinformatic analysis but about which little else was known. All four genes displayed high levels of expression in the hypothalamus compared with surrounding brain tissue by RNA in situ hybridization (Fig. 1). Probes for A2610042L04 and Pnck detected abundant expression in the anterior hypothalamus, whereas a probe for Dscr1l2 detected the strongest expressions in the dorsal medial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus, and a probe for Impact detected the highest expression in the arcuate nucleus..

We used NCBI databases to map the 11 selected genes to chromosomal regions in the mouse genome (NCBI build 33) and human genome (NCBI build 35) (Table 3). We then correlated the map positions of selected genes with the genomic positions of published loci influencing obesity-related traits in either human or other mammals (23) (Table 3) updated and published on-line as "The Obesity Gene Map Database" (11a). We identified eight traits, such as body mass index, fat mass, and percent body fat, that had been mapped to the same chromosomal regions as our selected genes in human studies of weight gain and obesity. We then identified cases where obesity traits had been identified as mapping within the mouse, rat, or pig chromosomal region homologous to human chromosome band(s) containing the selected genes. We did not include traits that had been mapped to an interval that contained more than three chromosome bands, which would contain a very large number of candidate genes. In this way, we identified 13 obesity-related traits in the mouse (11), rat (1), or pig (1) that correlated to the map positions of 6 of the 11 selected genes; these traits were all related to obesity and weight gain. Except for A2610042L04, a poorly characterized predicted mouse gene on chromosome 14, all selected genes were in regions of a mammalian genome where genetic evidence for an obesity-related trait exists..

Previous studies designed to identify cDNAs enriched in the hypothalamus used subtractive hybridization (7) or EST cataloguing (12). Although these methods did identify genes expressed in the hypothalamus, there are intrinsic biases toward highly expressed genes in both methods; subtractive hybridization methodologies can also have intrinsic sequence-specific biases. In contrast, high-throughput gene expression profiling provides a robust, unbiased, searchable resource that is freely available to the research community. We examined the relative expression levels of an estimated 30,000 genes in the murine hypothalamus as determined by Affymetrix microarray technology and made available by the Novartis Research Foundation (8). From this, we identified a set of genes not previously recognized to be important in hypothalamic function but highly and preferentially expressed in the murine hypothalamus. It is exciting to think that if such a database had been available at the time that we cloned Magel2 in 1999, this analysis could have facilitated the selection of human MAGEL2 as a candidate gene for the extreme obesity seen in Prader-Willi syndrome..

From this, we identified a set of genes not previously recognized to be important in hypothalamic function but highly and preferentially expressed in the murine hypothalamus. It is exciting to think that if such a database had been available at the time that we cloned Magel2 in 1999, this analysis could have facilitated the selection of human MAGEL2 as a candidate gene for the extreme obesity seen in Prader-Willi syndrome..

The candidate genes could be involved in any number of the interrelated processes partially mediated by the hypothalamus besides energy and fluid balance, such as circadian rhythm, reproduction, stress responses, and temperature regulation (1). The definitive proof of their involvement in obesity, rather than in other functions of the hypothalamus, would come from a demonstration of gene dysregulation in various models of obesity, including genetic and diet-induced obesity. We concentrated on obesity because of the large number of studies providing genetically mapped obesity-related traits, but the genes that we identified could equally well have roles in other disorders of hypothalamic function. Other regions of the brain, including the cortex and hindbrain, have important roles in food intake (22) but have major roles in other neurological functions. The gut, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues also have major roles in appetite, and parallel studies could reveal novel obesity susceptibility genes that are highly and specifically expressed in those tissues but not expressed in the brain and hypothalamus..

The information available about the cellular and physiological function of the proteins encoded by these genes is, however, highly variable. Furthermore, the size of the intervals in which obesity traits have been mapped is also highly variable. Further genetic and molecular studies would clarify possible roles of the candidate genes in obesity. For example, the candidate gene located within the region where specific mouse strains or human subjects have shown genetic predisposition to obesity could be sequenced for coding or regulatory sequence variants. These variants could then be tested in larger populations for association with obesity-related traits, including traits genetically mapped to the chromosomal intervals in which the genes reside. Finally, further investigations of the physiological and cellular functions of the proteins identified in this and other bioinformatic screens may elucidate the role of specific genes and gene products in hypothalamic function and genetic predisposition to obesity..

Glucocorticoids play a key role to promote positive energy balance in normal and pathological conditions, at least in part, by altering the sensitivity to hypothalamic peptides. The hyperphagia after central neuropeptide Y administration, for example, is attenuated by ADX, and there is evidence that glucocorticoids influence both MCH and orexin A activity. In the present study, feeding responses to third ventricular MCH and orexin A were measured in rats after bilateral ADX or sham surgery. ADX rats were significantly less sensitive to the orexigenic action of third ventricular MCH, whereas orexin A-induced hyperphagia was unaffected. Replacement of corticosterone in the drinking water of ADX rats reversed the effects of ADX on MCH sensitivity. Although we found significant populations of glucocorticoid receptors in the lateral hypothalamus, none were colocalized with either MCH or orexin A-containing cell bodies. Furthermore, whereas ADX significantly reduced hypothalamic MCH and orexin gene expression, this could not be restored by glucocorticoids in the drinking water. Collectively, the present data suggest that glucocorticoids may promote food intake in part by potentiating the orexigenic actions of MCH without affecting the actions of orexin A and that glucocorticoids act indirectly to influence the effects of MCH on food intake..

Among the myriad factors mediating the regulation of food intake and body weight is the glucocorticoid, cortisol (corticosterone in rats) that is secreted from the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids are lipophilic molecules that freely cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system, including those nuclei in the hypothalamus that are critical for energy balance regulation (2). Glucocorticoids have long-term effects on food intake and obesity (3), and in rodents, most forms of genetic obesity are associated with increased glucocorticoid levels, whereas a lack of glucocorticoids is linked to hypophagia and reduced body weight (4). The central infusion of glucocorticoids also leads to an increase in food intake and body weight (5). In humans, a change in glucocorticoid status can also alter body weight. For example, individuals with Addison s disease exhibit anorexia and weight loss due to adrenal insufficiency, whereas patients with Cushing s disease and other glucocorticoid excess syndromes have increased food intake and visceral adiposity (reviewed in Ref. 2). In rodents, adrenalectomy (ADX) reverses many forms of obesity, whereas glucocorticoid replacement restores the obese state (4, 6) and glucocorticoid administration to adrenal-intact animals increases food intake and weight gain (4, 7)..

Several studies have elucidated the actions of glucocorticoids on activity of both the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei (ARC) (8). Less explored is whether glucocorticoids also act upon neuropeptide systems within the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Because it has long been known that activity of the LH is associated with increased food intake and weight gain, one reasonable hypothesis about the powerful effects of glucocorticoids to stimulate positive energy balance is that they act in part by stimulating the neuropeptide systems within the LH..

Neuroanatomical studies in rats demonstrate that MCH gene expression is limited to the LH and the zona incerta with extensive fiber projections throughout the brain (10). MCH is produced from prepro-MCH along with two other putative peptides, neuropeptides EI and GE (11). The only known MCH receptor in rats is SLC-1, a G-coupled protein receptor present throughout the brain and periphery (12, 13). Central MCH is involved in many different physiological functions including reproduction, stress, activity, and importantly energy balance (reviewed in Ref. 14). Food restriction increases MCH expression, and central injection of MCH promotes feeding (15). In addition, MCH-deficient mice have reduced body weight and are lean due to hypophagia and an increase in metabolic rate (16). The central administration of MCH also elicits an increase of water intake that is independent of food intake (17)..

Orexin influences a variety of endocrine, autonomic, and metabolic functions, including the control of food intake, wakefulness, motor activity, metabolic rate, and blood pressure (19). Orexin A is a 33-amino acid peptide that increases food intake and body weight in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the brain (20). Conversely, administration of an orexin receptor antibody reduces food intake in fasted rats (21). Similar to MCH, fasting up-regulates orexin mRNA expression (22). Orexin-containing neurons project widely through the central nervous system and to hypothalamic nuclei important for the control of feeding where orexin receptors are located such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN), LH, ARC, and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (reviewed in Ref. 18)..

We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids promote the actions of the peptides in the lateral hypothalamus as part of the complex hypothalamic system that regulates energy balance. As a result, the present study first investigated the effects of third ventricular (i3vt) administration of MCH and orexin A on food intake in both ADX rats and sham-operated controls. Next, we examined the influence of glucocorticoids on the expression of both MCH and orexin mRNA using semiquantitative PCR. Because ADX causes a deficiency of circulating hormones in addition to glucocorticoids, we also examined whether or not glucocorticoid replacement could reverse any of the effects observed after ADX. Finally, we assessed the potential colocalization of MCH and orexin protein with glucocorticoid receptors within the LH to determine whether glucocorticoids may act directly on these neuronal populations..

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	54	In addition to examining the effect of glucocorticoids on the hyperphagic actions of MCH and orexin A, we examined the actions of glucocorticoids to alter mRNA expression of MCH and orexin. In accord with previous data, ADX reduced hypothalamic MCH mRNA, and orexin mRNA (28, 29). However, these reductions observed in both MCH and orexin were not restored by 5 d of corticosterone replacement in the drinking water despite this regimen achieving glucocorticoid levels comparable to those of sham-operated animals. These data suggest that the gene expression changes in these lateral hypothalamic peptides are not glucocorticoid dependent but depend on nonglucocorticoid aspects of ADX. Previous reports described that MCH mRNA was increased above that of sham controls in ADX rats treated with dexamethasone (28). Similarly, dexamethasone administration restored orexin mRNA after ADX (29). Although it is commonly used, dexamethasone does not have the same binding properties as glucocorticoids (30), and it makes it much harder to assess whether physiological levels of glucocorticoid replacement are achieved. Further work is necessary to address whether these methodological differences underlie the differences between the current data and reports from other groups. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that mineralocorticoids may have significant effects on the lateral hypothalamus. This is particularly true in the case of MCH because we have reported that MCH has a potent and rapid effect to increase water intake even in the absence of available food (17), making it possible that the osmoregulatory aspects of mineralocorticoids may influence fluid ingestion via actions on MCH..

Despite the fact that there is a large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LH, there is no evidence that any of them are located on either MCH- or orexin-containing neurons. This is consistent with the data from the gene expression experiments, in which changes in both MCH and orexin expression appeared not to be tied to glucocorticoid action..

Although both systems have cell bodies almost exclusively in the LH and act to regulate food intake, they appear to do so by separate neural circuits. These data indicate that the actions of MCH to stimulate food intake are glucocorticoid dependent, whereas the actions of orexin-A are not. In addition, MCH should now be added to the extensive list of regulatory peptides whose effects are altered by glucocorticoids. Thus it appears that glucocorticoids have broad effects on a number of central nervous system circuits that have been linked to the control of food intake..

MCH has projections to many brain regions important in the regulation of energy balance (10). For example, SLC-1 (the first and only identified MCH receptor in rodents) mRNA and immunoreactivity have been observed in the ARC, PVN, LH, and VMN (13). It is possible, then, that glucocorticoids exert their effects on the MCH-food intake system by acting on the target cells for MCH. For example, strong signals for both SLC-1 and GR have been observed in the PVN, making this a potential candidate for the site of action of glucocorticoids to reduce MCH s ability to increase food intake (13, 27)..

Consistent with this, MCH and -MSH exert opposing and antagonistic effects on food intake (31). Other studies demonstrate that administration of either agouti-related protein (AgRP) or SHU9119 increases MCH mRNA but not orexin mRNA (32). Because ADX increases melanocortin tone in some rodent models (33, 34), it is possible to speculate that this increase in melanocortin tone may antagonize the orexigenic effects of MCH, leading to the present effects of ADX on MCH, but not on orexin..

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	64	Another possibility is that MCH exerts its effects via actions in the ARC to alter the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and/or AgRP. Glucocorticoid receptors are found on these neurons (35) and the potent orexigenic effects of NPY and AgRP are blocked by glucocorticoid deficiency (34, 36). Recent reports indicate that the ARC is a potent site for MCH to increase food intake and that in hypothalamic explants, the administration of MCH increases the release of NPY, suggesting that MCH may act through the activation of NPY neurons to affect feeding (37). These data lead to the hypothesis that reduced action of MCH during glucocorticoid deficiency could be due to decreased actions of NPY and/or AgRP. The reverse may also be true; that is, it has been proposed that NPY and/or AgRP exert their effects via recruiting MCH neurons in the LH (38). Double-label immunohistochemistry demonstrates that MCH neurons receive innervation from NPY-immunoreactive fibers (39), and data also suggest that MCH neurons may express NPY receptors (40). Such evidence encourages the hypothesis that the effect of ADX to reduce the orexigenic actions of MCH may be responsible for the alteration of NPY actions after ADX. Future research should identify the glucocorticoid receptor populations that are responsible for the ability of glucocorticoids to dramatically alter the effects of a variety of neuropeptides such as MCH, NPY, -MSH, and AgRP..

Analysis of the physical map of the XLPRA and RP3 intervals shows a high degree of conservation in terms of genes and their order. We have found different mutations in exon ORF15 of the RPGR gene in two distinct mutant dog strains (XLPRA1, XLPRA2). Microdeletions resulting in a premature stop or a frameshift mutation result in very different retinal phenotypes, which are allele-specific and consistent for each mutation. The phenotype associated with the frameshift mutation in XLPRA2 is very severe and manifests during retinal development; the phenotype resulting from the XLPRA1 nonsense mutation is expressed only after normal photoreceptor morphogenesis. Splicing of RPGR mRNA transcripts in retina is complex, and either exon ORF15 or exon 19 can be a terminal exon. The retina-predominant transcript contains ORF15 as a terminal exon, and is expressed in normal and mutant retinas. The frameshift mutation dramatically alters the deduced amino acid sequence, and the protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected cells.

This locus accounts for approximately 60 to 90% of affected XLRP pedigrees, although previous studies found RPGR mutations in only 20% of families (2,6,7). More recently, novel protein coding sequences have been identified in regions formerly regarded as introns of RPGR. One of these, exon ORF15, is a mutational hot spot, and mutations in this exon now account for the majority of RP3 cases (8)..

Retinal function remained normal until 6 months of age or later, after which there was a decrease in the amplitude of the dark-adapted rod and cone responses (Fig. 4IA1 to 3). Morphologically, XLPRA1 photoreceptors remained normal until young adulthood; thereafter, rods showed distinct irregularities of the outer segments, followed by degeneration. Cone abnormalities appeared less severe, and a proportionally larger number of cones remained in the visual cell layer in late disease (Fig. 4IIA to D). All affected males showed end-stage retinal disease by 4 years of age..

(I) Each panel shows the responses to scotopically balanced red and blue stimuli, white light, 5 Hz rod and 30 Hz cone stimuli. In XLPRA1, ERG develops normally (A1, 70 days) and remains normal until early adulthood. Amplitudes then decrease with age (A2, 1.3 years; A3, 2.5 years). XLPRA2 shows rod and cone responses that are reduced in amplitude or abnormal in waveform early (B1, 70 days; B2, 4 months). By 1 year (B3) the rod responses are nearly absent, but distinct cone signals with prolonged timing remain. XLPRA1 (D, 2.5 years) and XLPRA2 (E=2 years) carriers retain normal ERG waveforms but lower amplitudes, especially in XLPRA2. C, normal control. Vertical lines or arrows, light stimulus onset; calibration marker, 100  microV and 50 ms except for rod flicker (100 ms). (II) In XLPRA1, retina and RPE are normal (A, 9.4 months.) before developing outer segment (OS) abnormalities (B, 13 months). Degeneration occurs subsequently, but the rate and severity varies between affected animals (C, 15 months; D, 3 years). Remaining cones are prominent (oblique arrows). XLPRA2 retina develops abnormally; outer segments are disorganized and disoriented early (E, 1 month), and photoreceptors degenerate rapidly (F, 4 months; G, 7 months; H, 1.9 years). XLPRA1 carrier outside areas of patchy retinal degeneration shows a lower number of normal surviving photoreceptors (I, 5 years). XLPRA2 carrier (J, K, 1 year) shows patchy degeneration (J, horizontal bracket) and abnormally developed photoreceptors. The compound heterozygote (L, 9.7 months) shows advanced degeneration.

There was relative preservation of cone flicker responses when rod function is severely compromised, but the cone signals are abnormally small and, in older animals, increased in timing. In parallel, photoreceptor morphogenesis is abnormal. Outer segments are highly disorganized and disoriented as they develop (Fig. 4IIE), and visual cell degeneration is present by 4 months and progresses (Fig. 4IIF,G).

Low-amplitude responses were present in young adult carriers of either genotype (Fig. 4IC to E), but progressive loss of function was found only in XLPRA2 (data not shown). Other than foci of patchy retinal degeneration, the remaining photoreceptors in XLPRA1 heterozygotes were normal (Fig. 4III). This was not the case for XLPRA2, since the carrier retina failed to develop normally, and surviving photoreceptors showed severe structural abnormalities (compare Fig. 4III with J and K). Such severe pathology in XLPRA2 carriers indicates that the mutation kills mutant photoreceptors early in development, and produces collateral damage in surviving normal ones. When this allele is expressed in the already compromised retina of a compound heterozygote, the disease is very severe (Fig. 4IIL)..

The specificity of the mutations is confirmed by finding no other sequence abnormalities in the characterized RPGR transcripts (18 and present study). Additionally, we scanned for the presence of the mutations in 137 dogs (211 chromosomes) of 20 different breeds, and found deletions only in XLPRA1 (Siberian husky and Samoyed) or XLPRA2 (mongrel-derived) affected or carrier dogs, thus confirming that the mutations are not polymorphisms. We also scanned 20 wolves (29 chromosomes; 19 red wolves and 1 black wolf), and only found the deletion in two aged heterozygous red wolves that were asymptomatic. Based on the lack of a retinal disease phenotype in these females, the deletion is likely to be a rare, benign polymorphism (8)..

Of the 34 novel RP3 mutations reported recently, 23 were one-, two-, four- and five-nucleotide deletions that resulted in a frameshift with premature termination of translation (8). It was proposed that the purine-rich region may adopt unusual non B-DNA conformations and show sequence motifs similar to DNA polymerase- arrest sites found near other deletion hotspots; this can lead to microdeletions following slipped-strand mispairing events (21,22).

Of the 34 novel RP3 mutations reported recently, 23 were one-, two-, four- and five-nucleotide deletions that resulted in a frameshift with premature termination of translation (8). It was proposed that the purine-rich region may adopt unusual non B-DNA conformations and show sequence motifs similar to DNA polymerase- arrest sites found near other deletion hotspots; this can lead to microdeletions following slipped-strand mispairing events (21,22). We have found similar microdeletions in the present study, suggesting that RPGR exon ORF15 appears to be a mutation hotspot in canids..
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	63	Our studies demonstrate that the nature of the RPGR exon ORF15 deletions determine the retinal phenotype. Both disorders are distinct, and have remained so even though the diseases now are present in mixed-breed dogs of the same genetic background. This indicates that the phenotype results from differences between the two mutant proteins in vivo. The normal retinal development in XLPRA1 argues that the C-terminal 230 amino acids encoded by exon ORF15 are not vital for functional and structural differentiation of rods and cones. The same argument has been proposed for the role of the RCC1-like domain since photoreceptor development is normal in the Rpgr knockout mouse (9). However, the severe disease that develops in young adult animals indicates that RPGR plays an essential role in photoreceptor viability. In contrast, the abnormal retinal development that occurs in XLPRA2, and the rapid degeneration that ensues, suggests that the mutation disrupts the critical differentiation of rods and cones, and causes their early degeneration..

Through random X-inactivation (23), approximately 50% of the retinal cells express the mutant or normal RPGR, and the expression of the mutant gene can be examined in the milieu where half of the photoreceptors are genetically normal. Carriers of either disease show ophthalmoscopically visible patchy retinal degeneration  to  an indication of mosaicism, the hallmark of retinal random X-inactivation (24). These changes, which are variable in extent and severity, are evident in most carriers by the time they are young adults, and in all by the time they are advanced in age. These abnormalities are stationary in XLPRA1, but some XLPRA2 carriers often show progressive disease that results in advanced retinal degeneration by 5 to 6 years of age or older. In contrast, lack of any disease in aged heterozygous red wolves suggests that the three-nucleotide deletion is a benign polymorphism..

With the exception of two reports that, retrospectively, represent mutations in exon ORF15 (25,26), all others have been limited primarily to exons 1 to 10 (e.g. 4,27). These studies show comparably severe clinical phenotypes in XLRP patients to those found in the two canine models. Also, the majority of carriers show clinical disease varying from mild to severe [impaired night vision or visual field loss (3,24)]. In some families, the disease was sufficiently severe in females to be considered semidominant (28). Examination of exon ORF15 in these has identified null alleles in four of nine families (J.-M. Rozet, personal communication, 26 July 2001)..

0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	69	Expression studies of RPGR have shown that alternative splicing is complex, and species-specific variants may exist. The splice variants reported for RPGR are mainly after exon 13, especially in the brain and testes (18,25). Additionally, alternative exon usage of introns has been found frequently for RPGR transcripts; for example exon 14a (intron 14) in mouse (25) and dog (18), exons 15a, 15b1, 15b2 and ORF15 (intron 15) in human, mouse, cow and dog (8 and present study), and exon 19a in mouse [intron 18 (25)]. The alternative splicing and exon usage suggests that different RPGR protein isoforms are produced for specific functions in vivo. The exon 16 to 19 probe mainly detected an 8.9 kb band, but failed to detect the 5 kb band that was recognized with probes for exons 3 to 10, exon 14a and ORF15. This result suggests that exon ORF15 can be used as a terminal exon (5 kb band), or alternatively spliced to exons 16 to 19 (8.9 kb band). We have found a putative consensus splice donor site, conserved between human and dog, located before the stop codon in the 3' coding region of exon ORF15. This may splice exon ORF15 to exons 16 to 19, and translate the polypeptide in frame to include most of exon ORF15 and exons 16 to 19. In this case, the putative protein will regain the C-terminal isoprenylation site ( to CTIL) located in alternative terminal exon 19 (2)..

Recently, a 6 kb band has been reported for human retina with both ORF15 and exon 3 to 19 probes (29). The 8.9 kb band has no match to known sizes of RPGR sequences. This suggests that additional undiscovered exon(s) or alternative polyadenylation sites are used in RPGR processing. In addition, with the exon ORF15 probe, we consistently detected two bands with similar intensity, 8.9 kb and another of slightly smaller size (Fig. 6A), which suggests that different splice variants may exist. The spatial relevance of the predominant 5 kb splice variant expressed in retina, and the mutations found in exon ORF15, may explain why the observed phenotype is confined to the retina..

In vitro, the XLPRA1 premature stop mutant behaves similarly to the wild-type protein, whereas the XLPRA2 frameshift protein aggregates in the ER compartment. In examining the transfection results, we attach no significance to the presence or absence of GFP nuclear labeling, since it may result from protein cleavage in a small proportion of constructs so that GFP enters the nucleus, or a weak nuclear localization in the vector. Aggregation of XLPRA2 mutant exon ORF15 protein may result from the additional abnormal residues, which impair proper folding. The in vitro results are consistent with the phenotypic differences found in the two diseases. Based on the presence of retinal transcripts with exon ORF15 in both normal and XLPRA mutant retinas, and the very different phenotypes of the two diseases, we propose that the XLPRA1 mutation causes a loss of function that is not critical for visual cells during development, but is essential later for their sustained viability. In contrast, the XLPRA2 mutation affects photoreceptors early in development, and has devastating consequences for the retina..

Canine-specific probes of TCTE1L, SRPX, RPGR and OTC were prepared by PCR using degenerate primers, and the purified BAC DNA digested to identify microsatellite markers by hybridization. The experimental details for meiotic and RH mapping have been described (19). The contig was built with BAC clones positive for TCTE1L, SRPX, RPGR, and OTC and extended by end sequencing. The size of BAC clones was determined using NotI digestion, fingerprinting with EcoRV and separation by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The BLAST search of end and internal sequences for exons and conserved regions between human and dog was also used for contig assembly..

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   The main systemic disorders resulting from prolonged sleep deprivation in laboratory animals are a negative energy balance, low circulating thyroid hormones, and host defense impairments. Low thyroid hormones previously have been found caused by altered regulation at the level of the hypothalamus with possible pituitary involvement. The present studies investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on other major anabolic hormonal systems. Plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations and major secretory bursts were characterized. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was evaluated as an integrative marker of peripheral GH effector activity. Prolactin (PRL) was assessed by basal concentrations and by stimulating the pituitary with exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Leptin was studied for its linkage to metabolic signs of sleep loss and its correspondence to altered neuroendocrine regulation in other disease states. Last, plasma corticosterone was measured to investigate the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation. Sleep deprivation was produced by the disk-over-water method, a well-established means of selective deprivation of sleep and noninterference with normal waking behaviors. Hormone concentrations were determined in sham comparisons and at intervals during baseline and experimental periods lasting at least 15 days in partially and totally sleep-deprived rats. The results indicate that high-amplitude pulses of GH were nearly abolished and that concentrations of GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin all were suppressed by sleep deprivation. Corticosterone concentration was relatively unaffected. Features of these results, such as low GH and low IGF-I, indicate failed negative feedback and point to hypothalamic mechanisms as containing the foci responsible for peripheral signs..

Some of the clinical states associated with abnormal sleep include pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular disease, thrombotic disease, epilepsy, arthritis, mood disorders, chronic pain, and shortened life span (reviewed in Refs. 39 and 49a). The physical consequences of sleep deprivation have not been localized. Evidence from studies in laboratory animals suggest that multitropic factors in immune and hormonal systems contribute to the absence of localization..

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	8	The three principal consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation in the rat are a progressively deepening negative energy balance (8, 18, 23), reduced thyroid hormone concentrations (8, 19, 20), and abnormal control of microorganisms (22). Sleep-deprived rats become strikingly and progressively hyperphagic but do not gain weight. The negative energy balance is not due to malabsorption of calories (8) or diabetes (18) but may be a metabolic response to infectious processes. Abnormal control of microorganisms was discovered by the detection of live, pathogenic bacteria in normally sterile body tissues (16, 22). This deficiency in the host defense system is the earliest clinically and biologically significant sign so far discovered, occurring within five experimental days when the outward appearance of the animal is healthy and metabolic changes are not as marked as they later become. The third principal feature, hypothyroxinemia, is manifested by a progressive decline in both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), with T4 eventually reaching levels below assay detection in some cases (20). After an average of 3 wk, these and other signs result in advanced morbidity (scrawny and feeble appearance, decreased food intake from peak consumption) and hypothermia (8, 18), primary bacteremia with poor or absent inflammatory responses (16), and subsequent lethality (53)..

A progressive decline in plasma T4 in sleep-deprived rats is not accompanied by an increase in plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), whereas low plasma T4 is normally a potent stimulant for pituitary TSH secretion (71). Challenge tests of TSH release from the pituitary by exogenous administration of the hypothalamic peptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) revealed normal stimulated release of TSH and an appropriate increase in circulating T4 and T3 (20). Examination of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus revealed an eventual tripling of TRH transcript levels in most experimental animals, suggesting a compensatory response to low T4, presumably through increased negative feedback to the hypothalamus. Even so, TSH failed to respond to increased TRH biosynthesis (19). These data suggest that TRH stimulation of TSH is inhibited and that one locus of sleep deprivation's effects is TRH translation or release by the hypothalamus..

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	12	Relatively little is known regarding other neuroendocrine consequences of sustained sleep deprivation and whether there is broad pituitary or hypothalamic involvement. One of the objectives of the present series of experiments was to determine whether chronic sleep deprivation also affects the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). Alteration in their pleiotropic functions could provide future avenues of discovery for how sleep deprivation specifically results in health consequences. Linkage of GH and PRL secretion to non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been repeatedly demonstrated in humans. Plasma peak GH concentration generally coincides with sleep onset and is delayed if sleep is delayed. Smaller GH peaks generally coincide with subsequent slow-wave sleep phases (52, 56, 64, 73). PRL concentrations are elevated during sleep, even if sleep is delayed (74). Short-term sleep deprivation of 24 to 36 h blunts the amplitude of major GH secretory periods during that time (10, 11), whereas sleep after sleep deprivation is associated with a return of normal amplitudes (11, 59, 73). Similarly, GH pulses in rats are abolished during short-term sleep deprivation of 3 h (34). Whether abolishment would persist beyond 3 h and whether this is an acute reaction are unknown. The proximal hypothalamic mechanisms regulating GH secretion by the pituitary are growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (somatotropin release-inhibiting factor; SRIF), which operate in a reciprocal manner. Previous studies have shown that short-term sleep deprivation of 6 to 8 h can reduce the content of GHRH in the hypothalamus (26) and result in increased GHRH mRNA in the PVN and increased SRIF mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (69). Whether these changes are important to hypophysioportal stimulation of GH secretion is unknown, whereas hypotheses exist for their role in the regulation of sleep behavior (26). Furthermore, GHRH binding and receptor mRNA levels are decreased by 50% in the hypothalamus of rats sleep deprived for 8 h, whereas pituitary levels remain unchanged. These latter findings have been interpreted as indicating downregulation of receptors in response to GHRH release (27). In addition to its role in lactation, PRL is a major anabolic hormone and cytokine (5). Short-term sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation in humans are associated with lower nocturnal PRL levels than when sleep occurs (74, 77). PRL is considered to be sleep promoting in laboratory animals (50, 80) and is reduced by 24 and 72 h, but not by 48 h, of sleep deprivation combined (i.e., confounded) with constant forced locomotion (33). Deficiency of PRL results in grossly reduced immunocompetency in laboratory animals (49), to which sleep-deprived rats share a resemblance..

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	14	It is also unknown at present whether sustained sleep deprivation affects the secretion of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, which acts on the hypothalamus. Leptin has endocrine actions and pleiotropic effects that include a major role in the regulation of energy balance (reviewed in Refs. 24, 25, and 31). Several lines of evidence suggest a link between this hormone and different pathophysiological changes resulting from sleep deprivation. For example, decreased leptin concentrations occur with decreased fat reserve and impairments of immunity (reviewed in Ref. 25), which are consequences of sleep deprivation. On the other hand, increases in leptin secretion are associated with increased sympathetic activation (58), elevated metabolic rate (45), and decreased body weight (12), which are also produced by prolonged sleep deprivation (reviewed in Ref. 17). Leptin also increases in response to exposure to bacterial cell components (reviewed in Ref. 30), which would be an expected event resulting from bacterial translocation and efforts to control posttranslocation survival in sleep-deprived animals (22). In humans, substantially reduced leptin concentrations have been found in narcoleptic patients, who have abnormal sleep architecture (36, 60), and mildly reduced leptin concentrations have been found in normal subjects under conditions of acute sleep reduction (62)..

The effects of sleep deprivation were determined on concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), because it is the principal physiological mediator of many GH actions, and on concentrations of corticosterone, which in high levels is associated with endocrine abnormalities in other disease states (reviewed in Ref. 44). To this end, we employed a well-established procedure for producing sleep deprivation (9) and examined its effects on hormonal secretory patterns at intervals during the first two-thirds of the typical survival period for rats, at times before advanced morbidity. The present results indicate abnormally low concentrations of GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin, but appropriately increased PRL release when stimulated. These results provide evidence of altered hormonal regulation at the level of the hypothalamus and implicate suppression of anabolic hormones among the important health consequences of sleep deprivation..

Surgery included implantation of cortical (EEG) and muscle electrodes for electrophysiographic determination of sleep stages and wakefulness, as described previously (9).

The method produces a consistent amount of sleep reduction in our studies (16, 18, 21, 23). Under baseline conditions, sleep occurs during an average of 53% of the time. The sleep comprises 48% NREM sleep (comparable to human stages 1 to 4) and 6% paradoxical sleep (PS; also known as rapid eye movement sleep). After the baseline period, the experimental period begins. Detection of sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, by programmed microprocessing of amplitude changes in cortical EEG, cortical theta, and electromyographic variables, results in 6 s of forced locomotion for both rats, which is sufficient to produce arousal.

The method produces a consistent amount of sleep reduction in our studies (16, 18, 21, 23). Under baseline conditions, sleep occurs during an average of 53% of the time. The sleep comprises 48% NREM sleep (comparable to human stages 1 to 4) and 6% paradoxical sleep (PS; also known as rapid eye movement sleep). After the baseline period, the experimental period begins. Detection of sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, by programmed microprocessing of amplitude changes in cortical EEG, cortical theta, and electromyographic variables, results in 6 s of forced locomotion for both rats, which is sufficient to produce arousal. This is repeated upon each subsequent sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, resulting in wakefulness sustained over 90% of total time.

Each yoked animal is frequently awakened when asleep because sleep normally occupies 50% of the time, and the yoked rat is paired to a sleep-deprived rat that may fall asleep, thus triggering platform rotation. Yoked rats therefore are partially sleep deprived and usually exhibit several signs in the same direction as do sleep-deprived rats but not to the same degree (e.g., Ref. 18). The yoked animals are considered important in showing that severe morbidity and death in sleep-deprived rats are not due to the experimental conditions extraneous to sleep loss, because these were matched for both groups (54). In addition, the yoked rats are viewed as comprising part of a dose-response curve, wherein partial sleep deprivation is intermediate to no sleep loss and total sleep loss..

Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases). The low detection limit of the GH assay was 2.4 pg/ml, and the high detection limit was 466 to 583 pg/ml. The low and high sensitivities for PRL were 0.6 and 16 ng/ml, respectively. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for GH and PRL were  < 10%. Determinations of basal plasma IGF-I, leptin, and corticosteroids were performed using commercial RIA and enzyme immunoassay kits. The sensitivity range for IGF-I was 127 to 4714 ng/ml (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX). The intra- and interassay CVs were both  < 4%. The low and high detection limits for leptin were 0.5 and 50 ng/ml (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO), and the intra- and interassay CVs were  < 4 and 6%, respectively. The low and high detection limits for corticosterone were 20 and 2,000 ng/ml (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories), and the intra- and interassay CVs were  < 5 and 6%, respectively.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	39	Data analysis. Apart from the baseline period, the data for each rat during the experimental period were truncated at 16 days if the experimental conditions had been continued longer. This permitted values for IGF-I, leptin, corticosterone, food intake, and changes in body weight to be partitioned into four consecutive 4-day intervals (i.e., bins). The data were averaged across each 4-day interval for each rat and then averaged within intervals of each experimental group. These data were compared by means of an unbalanced, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. One yoked subject was eliminated from study because the electrode assembly became detached from the skull, resulting in an imbalance in the number of subjects per group. Occasionally, there were missing values within a subject across time, typically the result of indwelling catheter nonpatency on the day of blood collection for a particular factor or insufficient specimen volume for analysis. Missing values for a given 4-day bin were replaced by interpolation or extrapolation if they were isolated instances. Interpolations and extrapolations were limited to two (1 yoked and 1 home cage) data points for each leptin and IGF-I, and one data point for corticosterone. Subject values were excluded in toto from a given analysis if two or more 4-day values were missing. Exclusions included one yoked rat in the determination of leptin and IGF-I; one sleep-deprived rat in the determination of food intake; and one animal of each sleep-deprived, yoked, and home cage groups in the analysis of corticosterone. For these analyses, statistical significance was considered at P  <  0.05. Post hoc comparisons were performed by means of Student's t-tests. Such comparisons included analysis of changes in a group between particular time points, such as between baseline and a specific 4-day interval, or between groups at a particular time point. Paired t-tests were used when possible, but comparison of unpaired means was performed on those occasions when the data could not be paired because of exclusion of a subject. Nonsignificant statistical differences are designated as not significant. Variance is given as the mean  plus or minus  SE unless specifically noted as mean  plus or minus  SD..
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	40	Characteristics of GH pulsatile secretion were analyzed with the ULTRA statistical algorithm to separate small peaks from background variation, according to guidelines described by Van Cauter (72). In ULTRA, the CV of the assay is used to determine whether increments or decrements of chronological data points are within the range of expected variation. The number of CVs used determines the threshold for significant change; typically, two to three CVs are applied (72). In this way, increments or decrements in hormonal concentration may be considered part of a pulse if the values are above a criterion threshold for assay variability, thus limiting false-positive pulses. In our analysis, we used three times the CV of the radioactive counts per minute, which ranged from 4.4 to 5.8%, as the constant in the algorithm signifying a significant change from previous and subsequent values across all values within that particular assay. Characterization of GH and PRL secretion were based on the following parameters given by Lafuente et al. (40): 1) minimum and maximum values observed; 2) integrative value (average value of the samples collected during the period of observation); 3) absolute amplitude (difference in concentration between peak and minimum values); and 4) relative amplitude (ratio of absolute amplitude to the minimum value). Pulses of GH detected by ULTRA additionally were assessed for frequency in those instances in which two peaks were captured during the 6-h sampling period. Parameters characterizing PRL and GH concentrations were compared a priori by Student's t-test, and P  <  0.05 was considered statistically significant..

By comparison, yoked animals under partial sleep deprivation were variously affected; individual instances sometimes were of increased PRL concentration. Challenge tests of pituitary secretion of PRL by TRH administration yielded an initial PRL response that was proportional to normal in both sleep-deprived and yoked rats. However, the total amount of poststimulation PRL secreted over 40 min was significantly less in sleep-deprived rats than during the baseline period, reflecting diminished basal concentrations.

Rather, plasma levels of leptin appeared to reflect energy stores that became inadequate, eventually manifested by the animal's increased food consumption and failure to gain weight.

In these states, increased glucocorticoids are known to alter functions carried out by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and to suppress immunity (reviewed in Ref. 44). The present results suggest that this same reciprocal relationship and its associated circumstances do not extend de facto to the sleep-deprived state. In rats rendered diabetic (4) and in rats fasted for  > 4 to 72 h (46, 75, 76), increases in corticosterone typically are three- to fivefold or more. In rats in studies of behavioral stress, increases in corticosterone can be ninefold (29, 51), and PRL is increased (67). By comparison, in the present study, sleep-deprived rats showed only a mild tendency for increased corticosteroid concentrations by 50%, and not more than was recorded at various times for the other two groups. This result replicates previous findings (8, 20) and corroborates the mild or unchanged values found in the results of human studies of selective sleep deprivation (37, 38, 70). Although changes in corticosteroid receptors, sensitivity, and catabolism cannot yet be ruled out, corticosterone concentration in sleep-deprived rats appears consistent with what may be expected to mobilize fuel to support metabolic and cellular requirements. As such, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis thus does not appear overactivated, implying that corticosterone has no more than a modulatory role in either the suppression of anabolic hormones or the suppression of immunity in sleep-deprived rats..

However, several lines of evidence suggest the hypothalamus is the primary locus affected by sleep deprivation, with possible secondary pituitary involvement. For example, under normal conditions, a decrease in IGF-I is associated with an increase in GH release via a long negative feedback loop to the brain (reviewed in Refs. 47 and 55). The specific feedback mechanisms of IGF-I to GH mechanisms in the hypothalamus are not well elucidated but are believed to involve increased inhibitory tone by SRIF or reduced GHRH (reviewed in Ref. 68), which normally operate in a reciprocal manner to regulate GH secretion. For reduced IGF-I negative feedback to the hypothalamus to fail to increase GH would suggest increased SRIF tone and/or decreased GHRH. Evidence consistent with this framework is a finding by Gardi et al.

Leptin exerts negative feedback directly on the hypothalamus (reviewed in Refs. 25 and 31). Low circulating leptin under conditions of a negative energy balance or induced by experimental means is a potent signal for increased mRNA expression, secretion of neuropeptide Y, and agouti-related peptide in the hypothalamus, and reduced signaling of -melanocyte-stimulating hormone and its precursor proopiomelanocortin (reviewed in Ref. 25). These changes are relevant to determining mediation of increased food intake and the causal direction between altered regulation of neuroendocrine peptides and development of a negative energy balance. Diminished leptin is associated with abolition of GH secretory peaks, and administration of leptin is associated with restoration of those peaks (66) by affecting GHRH and SRIF (78). Similarly, decreased leptin resulting from food deprivation is associated with decreased circulating thyroid hormones and PRL, and administration of leptin under these conditions reverses both of these hormonal changes (1, 28, 41, 79). However, the present results suggest that leptin may not be the necessary and sufficient factor for reduction of these hormones, since partially sleep-deprived rats showed equivalent reductions in leptin secretion but less interference with pituitary hormone secretion. A growing body of evidence indicates central integration of leptin signaling and central control over leptin concentrations..

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	82	The hormonal changes in sleep-deprived rats may be viewed either as dysfunctional or as adaptive responses. On the one hand, there is abundant evidence that diseases with a central locus, such as hypothalamic dysfunction, can produce peripheral effects and changes in neuroendocrine regulation (reviewed in Ref. 47). On the other hand, low leptin and suppression of anabolic hormones may be viewed as adaptive responses to a negative energy balance, as evidenced by the progressive food intake and body weight changes in sleep-deprived rats. Suggestions that the central effects of sleep deprivation should be considered dysfunctional rather than adaptive come from examples that contrast sleep-deprived and starved rats. Quite opposite to starved rats, declines of T4 and T3 in sleep-deprived rats are consistent with metabolic activation and not with downregulation. The ratio of T3 to T4 is dramatically increased (8), indicating a strong preference for the most metabolically active form of thyroid hormone without an increase in reverse T3 in a metabolically inactive pathway. Also, in contrast to starvation, sleep deprivation is associated with a 100-fold increase in the T4-to-T3 conversion enzyme 5'-deiodinase type II in brown adipose tissue (3), which is consistent with experimental hypothyroidism (13, 61), further suggesting that central changes in regulation of anabolic hormones produce a state in which peripheral mechanisms show activities consistent with compensation..
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	83	The hormonal changes in sleep-deprived rats may be viewed either as dysfunctional or as adaptive responses. On the one hand, there is abundant evidence that diseases with a central locus, such as hypothalamic dysfunction, can produce peripheral effects and changes in neuroendocrine regulation (reviewed in Ref. 47). On the other hand, low leptin and suppression of anabolic hormones may be viewed as adaptive responses to a negative energy balance, as evidenced by the progressive food intake and body weight changes in sleep-deprived rats. Suggestions that the central effects of sleep deprivation should be considered dysfunctional rather than adaptive come from examples that contrast sleep-deprived and starved rats. Quite opposite to starved rats, declines of T4 and T3 in sleep-deprived rats are consistent with metabolic activation and not with downregulation. The ratio of T3 to T4 is dramatically increased (8), indicating a strong preference for the most metabolically active form of thyroid hormone without an increase in reverse T3 in a metabolically inactive pathway.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	84	The clinical implications of suppression of these hormones are based on their many pleiotropic actions. Deficiency in PRL, induced by hypophysectomy that reduces circulating PRL to 50% of control values, is associated with normocytic anemia, grossly reduced immunocompetence, decreased body weight, and several other abnormalities (49) shared by sleep-deprived animals. GH has widespread effects on the growth and metabolism of most tissues, including by increasing DNA, RNA, protein synthesis, and mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 43). Suppression of leptin would be expected to extend beyond the effects on energy balance to include numerous effects. For example, leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice show many endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including decreased body temperature and immune defects (reviewed in Ref. 25). Decreases in IGF-I would be expected to diminish some or many of its effector functions that include autocrine and paracrine growth factor mediation of mitosis, differentiation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis in many tissues (reviewed in Ref. 43). Administration of IGF-I during burn injury improves body weight and gut mucosal weight, stimulates mucosal DNA and protein content, and reduces the incidence of bacterial translocation (32). The endocrine and immune systems are intricately linked, and the hormonal changes may be contributing to decreased resistance to infectious disease in this animal model. Deficiencies in GH, IGF-I, PRL, thyroid hormones, and leptin induced by sleep deprivation affect health and provide one explanation for the absence of localization of specific sleep deprivation effects. Low basal PRL and lack of reciprocal relationships between IGF-I and GH, and between leptin and corticosterone, point to the hypothalamus as a locus for sleep deprivation effects, where key factors interact before presentation of integrated signals to the pituitary..

Intact male rats and female rats at diestrus 2, proestrus, or estrus were fed normally or fasted for 48 h and injected with saline or glucose (400 mg/kg). Thereafter, preparations were subjected to immunohistochemical processing for the double staining of MCH and pCREB. Fasting increased the ratio of MCH neurons with pCREB (double-stained cells) in both male and female rats. In fasted rats, glucose injection decreased the ratio of double-stained cells more promptly in females than in males. The magnitude of decrease caused by glucose was greater at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2. Gonadectomy in males enhanced and in females attenuated the response of MCH neurons to glucose. Testosterone and estrogen replacement in males and females, respectively, restored the response of MCH neurons to glucose. The demonstrated sex differences in the response of MCH neurons to glucose correlated well with the gonadal steroid milieu; thus, MCH neurons may play an important role in sex differences in feeding behavior..

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   SEX DIFFERENCES IN feeding behavior have long been recognized in many species. For example, analyses of spontaneous patterns of feeding have shown that the size of a single meal is smaller in females than in males, and the total volume of daily food intake is also smaller in females than in males (1, 2). In addition, the size of a single meal varies during the estrous cycle, decreasing around the time of ovulation in females, including humans (1, 3, 4). Although these sex differences are attributable to gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone and/or estrogen (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), the neural mechanism is still unclear. For example, although cholecystokinin has been reported to be involved in estrogen-induced decrease in food intake (10), there is still controversy about whether cholecystokinin mediates estrogen-induced anorexia (11, 12). It is also not known whether cholecystokinin mediates testosterone-induced hyperphagia..

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	8	Recent studies have identified distinct neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (13) that generate hunger (14, 15). Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (16), is another neuropeptide that prominently induces feeding (17, 18). The hypothalamic circuit between the LHA and the arcuate nucleus is thus an important component of the central system controlling feeding behavior (19). In this circuit, judging from studies that genetically disrupted the orexigenic neuropeptides, MCH neurons in the LHA play a key role. Mice lacking the gene encoding MCH are lean (20), whereas mice overexpressing the MCH gene are susceptible to obesity (21). It has also been suggested that MCH neurons are involved in the glucosensing system, because hypothalamic MCH mRNA levels are increased by hypoglycemic conditions such as fasting, insulin injection, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment (14, 22, 23). In contrast to MCH, mice lacking the gene encoding prepro-orexin or NPY display normal growth (24, 25, 26)..

Because MCH neurons in the LHA play an important role in the regulation of feeding behavior, we hypothesized that there might be a sex difference in the activity of MCH neurons in the LHA during fasting and/or after glucose injection. In support of this view, hypothalamic MCH neurons are suggested to be involved in estrogen-induced weight loss in male rats (27). We therefore examined the response of MCH neurons to an iv injection of glucose after 48 h of fasting in adult male and female rats, using the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity as a marker of neural activity. On the assumption that a sex difference in MCH neurons existed, we also examined whether it could be affected by gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone and/or estrogen..

In contrast, CREB is a constitutively expressed transcription factor and can be immediately activated by phosphorylation via a cAMP- and calcium-dependent cascade (29, 30). Thus, we thought that pCREB was a suitable marker to examine neural activity that changes within a short period in response to dynamic changes such as blood glucose concentrations..

Male and female rats were castrated 4 wk before the experiment. After cannula implantation, they were fasted for 48 h and injected with 400 mg/kg glucose dissolved in 200  microl saline after the first blood sampling of 100  microl. Control rats were injected with the same volume of saline. Thereafter, blood was sampled 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection though the same cannula. An equal volume of heparinized saline (2 IU/ml) was injected after each sampling. As another control, blood samples were obtained from intact males, ORX males, females at proestrus, and OVX females that were not fasted. Blood glucose concentrations were determined with an instant blood glucose assay apparatus (ACCU-CHEK Comfort, Roche, Tokyo, Japan).

No significant differences in glucose (F3,13 = 0.811; P  >  0.1) or insulin (F3,13 = 0.398; P  >  0.5) were observed. As shown in Table 1, one-way ANOVA in each saline-injected group showed no significant effect of saline injection on blood glucose concentrations: the male group (F6,21 = 0.811; P  >  0.5), the ORX group (F6,21 = 0.61; P  >  0.5), the P group (F6,21 = 1.61; P  >  0.1), and the OVX group (F6,28 = 2.29; P  >  0.05), suggesting that the control procedure used in the present study did not affect blood glucose concentrations. However, blood glucose concentrations were significantly increased after glucose injection in all groups. One-way ANOVA at each time point showed that there was no significant difference in blood glucose concentrations among the groups (Table 2). In addition, the area under the curve (AUC), which was calculated for each rat, was not significantly different among the groups (F4,19 = 0.562; P  >  0.5). This suggests that changes in blood glucose concentrations after glucose injection were uniform among the groups. Insulin concentrations were also significantly increased after glucose injection in all groups, but one-way ANOVA at each time point showed that there was a significant difference in insulin concentrations among the groups (Table 2). That is, insulin concentrations in the intact male and the ORX groups were significantly higher than those in the D2, P, and OVX groups at some time points after glucose injection. In fact, the AUC of insulin was significantly different among the groups (F4,19 = 9.09; P  <  0.002). Post hoc comparison showed that the AUC in the intact male and ORX groups was significantly greater than in the D2, P, and OVX groups (P  <  0.05). This result suggested that insulin secretion in response to glucose in male rats was greater than that in female rats and was in good accord with previous reports of a sex difference in glucose tolerance (34, 35).

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	58	Although hypoglycemia caused by treatments such as fasting, insulin injection, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose injection increases the expression of hypothalamic MCH mRNA (14, 22, 23), there is little information on the second messenger system that would be stimulated by hypoglycemic conditions. For example, Fos expression was increased in the LHA by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but there were few MCH neurons that expressed Fos protein (22, 37). Thus, it is unclear whether Fos proteins are involved in the control of the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA by hypoglycemia. In experiment 1, we showed that under normal feeding conditions in male and female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined, approximately 10% of MCH neurons expressed pCREB-immunoreactive nuclei in the LHA, indicating that only a small population of MCH neurons is active in the LHA. However, we found that fasting for 48 h increased the ratio of double-stained neurons to approximately 40% in both sexes. Furthermore, we showed that this fasting-induced increase was independent of the presence of testosterone or estrogen. This is the first demonstration that MCH neurons express pCREB in their nuclei in response to fasting and is in good accord with the results of a previous study showing that fasting for 48 h increased pCREB levels in nuclear extracts from the rat hypothalamus, although which neurons expressed the pCREB was not shown (38). An analog of cAMP and agents that increase levels of endogenous cAMP and promote phosphorylation of CREB (29) were reported to elicit a vigorous feeding response when microinjected into the LHA (39). Thus, pCREB can be a reliable marker of activation of MCH neurons by 48-h fasting, and phosphorylation of CREB, probably promoted by an increase in cAMP, may contribute at least in part to the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons. We thus suggest that there is no sex difference in the fasting-induced activation of MCH neurons..

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	60	We also examined changes in the activity of MCH neurons after glucose injection in 48-h fasted rats in experiment 1 and found that a significant decrease in the ratio of double-stained neurons was induced after 5 min only in female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined. In contrast to female rats, MCH neurons in male rats failed to respond to glucose within 5 min. Additional time-course studies in experiment 2 demonstrated that MCH neurons in male rats responded to glucose 15 to 30 min after glucose injection, whereas those in female rats, at the stage that was most insensitive to glucose, MCH neurons responded after 5 to 15 min. In this study we found a clear sex difference in the response of MCH neurons to glucose; the response of MCH neurons to glucose was delayed in male rats compared with that in female rats. This is not due to differences in blood glucose concentrations, because there was no sex difference in blood glucose concentrations after glucose injection between intact male and female rats. Furthermore, this is not due to sex differences in insulin secretion in response to glucose, because there was no sex difference in the effect of castration on insulin secretion and thus it could not explain the results of experiment 3. One possible reason for this delay in the decrease in pCREB may be that the sensitivity of MCH neurons to glucose in male rats is less than that in female rats, and thus MCH neurons do not respond to an increase in glucose concentrations in blood, resulting in a delay of the decrease in pCREB. According to the glucostatic theory that an increase in glucose in blood is a signal for meal termination (33), the dietary glucose may inactivate the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons and induce meal termination more rapidly in female rats than in male rats. This may account for the sex difference in meal size, which is smaller in females than in males (1, 2). Although glucose-sensing neurons may respond to physiological changes in blood glucose and regulate integrative metabolic functions, such as counterregulatory responses, food intake, and metabolic rate (40), the glucostatic theory by itself is not sufficient to explain the complex regulation of feeding behavior (41). Glucose is, obviously, only one of several peripheral metabolic signals involved in the regulation of feeding behavior under physiological conditions (42). Hence, we speculate that the inactivation of MCH neurons by metabolic signals after feeding is faster in females than in males..

However, judging from an electrophysiological study showing that some neurons in the LHA respond to changes in glucose concentration in vitro (43), a direct effect of glucose on MCH neurons is likely. Effects of afferent signals from glucose sensors localized at different central and peripheral structures are also likely (41, 44). In the hypothalamus, NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus have been shown to be glucose-sensitive neurons in an in vitro electrophysiological study (45). Considering the hypothalamic circuit involving the LHA and arcuate nucleus (19), it is probable that glucose affects MCH neurons indirectly via NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus..

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	64	We also found in the present study that the response of MCH neurons to glucose varied depending on the stage of the estrous cycle, i.e. the magnitude of decrease in the number of double-stained neurons after glucose injection was greater at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2. An additional time-course study confirmed that the ratio of double-stained neurons at diestrus 2 decreased 15 min after glucose injection to approximately 10%, which was similar to the levels at proestrus and estrus 5 min after glucose injection, indicating that the response of MCH neurons to glucose at diestrus 2 was the most delayed. As discussed above, if the decrease in the activity of MCH neurons is related to meal termination, it follows that meal termination occurs more rapidly at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2. In support of this, the meal size was smaller at proestrus or estrus than at diestrus (2, 4). Therefore, MCH neurons may also participate in the fluctuation of feeding behavior during the estrous cycle..
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	65	Our findings in experiment 3 indicate that the sex difference in MCH neurons is at least in part attributable to the presence of gonadal steroid hormones in adults. That is, the presence of testosterone in males and that of estrogen in females are critical to the male- and female-type responses of MCH neurons to glucose. In male rats, we found that orchidectomy significantly enhanced the response of MCH neurons to glucose, but testosterone replacement attenuated the effect. Because orchidectomy decreased food intake (46), and this effect was reversed by testosterone replacement in ORX rats (7, 47, 48), we speculate that testosterone attenuates the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals and then increases food intake in males. In contrast, estrogen replacement did not cause any significant effect on orchidectomy-induced enhancement of the response to glucose in male rats. This result is in good accord with a report that food intake in ORX rats is relatively insensitive to the influence of estrogen compared with that in OVX rats (8). The results of the present study in male rats therefore suggest that estrogen could no longer enhance the response of MCH neurons to glucose, because orchidectomy caused the response to reach its maximum..

These results are in good accord with previous studies in which ovariectomy in adult female rats increased food intake (7, 46), and this effect was reversed by estrogen replacement (6). Thus, it can be easily hypothesized that estrogen enhances the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals in females and causes decreases in food intake and body weight. In support of this, estrogen inhibited the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA of female (49) and male (27) rats. In contrast to the effect of testosterone in ORX rats, testosterone enhanced the response of MCH neurons in OVX rats as estrogen did. This effect of testosterone in OVX rats could be explained by postulating that testosterone enhances the response of MCH neurons after being converted to estrogen. In support of this speculation, it has been suggested that in male rats, the reduced food intake and weight gain seen during high-dose testosterone treatment are due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen (8). In light of previous reports that females are more sensitive to the effect of estrogen on food intake than males (8, 50) and males are more sensitive to the effect of testosterone on food intake (47, 50), the present study indicates that the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons in females is not testosterone-induced attenuation, but is estrogen-induced enhancement. In males, in contrast, the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons is not estrogen-induced enhancement, but is testosterone-induced attenuation. Hence, the present study may provide a neural basis for the sex difference in feeding behavior, although the mechanisms of action of estrogen and testosterone need to be determined in future studies..

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Ghrelin is a newly discovered peptide that is released from the stomach and from neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and potently stimulates growth hormone release and food intake. Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurons in the ARC play an important role in the stimulation of food intake. The present study aimed to determine whether ghrelin directly activates NPY neurons and, if so, to explore its signaling mechanisms. Whether the neurons that respond to ghrelin could be regulated by orexin and leptin was also examined. We isolated single neurons from the ARC of rats and measured the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2 fluorescence imaging. Ghrelin (10-12 to 10-8 mol/l) concentration-dependently increased [Ca2+]i, which occurred in 35% of the ARC neurons. Approximately 80% of these ghrelin-responsive neurons were proved to be NPY-containing by immunocytochemical staining, and 58% of them were glucose-sensitive neurons as judged by their responses to lowering glucose concentrations. The [Ca2+]i responses to ghrelin were markedly attenuated by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) but not protein kinase C and by a blocker of N-type but not L-type Ca2+ channels. Orexin increased [Ca2+]i and leptin attenuated ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increases in the majority (80%) of ghrelin-responsive NPY neurons. These results demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to induce Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms. The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding..

The present study aimed to determine whether ghrelin directly activates NPY neurons and, if so, to explore its signaling mechanisms. Whether the neurons that respond to ghrelin could be regulated by orexin and leptin was also examined. We isolated single neurons from the ARC of rats and measured the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2 fluorescence imaging. Ghrelin (10-12 to 10-8 mol/l) concentration-dependently increased [Ca2+]i, which occurred in 35% of the ARC neurons. Approximately 80% of these ghrelin-responsive neurons were proved to be NPY-containing by immunocytochemical staining, and 58% of them were glucose-sensitive neurons as judged by their responses to lowering glucose concentrations. The [Ca2+]i responses to ghrelin were markedly attenuated by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) but not protein kinase C and by a blocker of N-type but not L-type Ca2+ channels. Orexin increased [Ca2+]i and leptin attenuated ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increases in the majority (80%) of ghrelin-responsive NPY neurons. These results demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to induce Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms. The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding..

Peripheral or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ghrelin releases growth hormone, stimulates food intake, and increases body weight in mice, rats, and humans (1 to 8). ICV injection of antighrelin IgG suppresses starvation-induced feeding (3). The daily pattern of plasma ghrelin levels in normal humans is characterized by a preprandial rise and postprandial fall (9). These findings have suggested that ghrelin plays a physiological role in the meal initiation..

Regarding a possible link between ghrelin and the NPY neurons in the ARC, it has been shown that GHSR mRNA is expressed in 94% of the NPY neurons in the ARC by double-labeling in situ hybridization histochemistry (12). Systemic or ICV administration of ghrelin causes the ARC neurons to express Fos and Egr-1 (3,13 to 15) and 90% of these Fos-positive neurons express NPY mRNA (13). Moreover, ghrelin increases the expression of NPY mRNA (3 to 5), and ICV administration of a NPY Y1 antagonist suppresses the ghrelin-stimulated food intake (3 to 5,15). These findings suggest that the NPY neurons in the ARC could be an important effector for the orexigenic action of ghrelin..

Signaling pathways for artificial GHS that act through GHSR in pituitary cells have been investigated. GHRP-2 (a GHS) increases intracellular cAMP levels in ovine but not rat pituitary somatotropes (16,17). GHRP-6 stimulates GH release from rat pituitary cells by activating protein kinase C (PKC) (17,18). Thus, the post-GHSR pathway could involve Gs and/or Gq proteins. However, the intracellular signaling for ghrelin s orexigenic action in the effector neurons is not well understood.

The ARC was isolated from the brain of the 5- to 7-week-old SD rats and then single neurons were prepared according to the procedures reported previously (25,26) with slight modifications. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of carbamic acid ethyl ester (900 mg/kg) and decapitated, and their brain was removed. Brain slices containing the ARC were prepared, and the whole ARC of the left and right sides was punched out. The dissected tissues were washed with 10 mmol/l HEPES-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (HKRB) containing 10 mmol/l glucose. Then they were incubated in HKRB supplemented with 20 units/ml papain (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO), 0.015 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease, and 0.75 mg/ml BSA for 15 min at 36 degrees C in a shaking water bath, followed by gentle mechanical trituration for 5 to 10 min. After trituration, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 100g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in HKRB and distributed onto coverslips. The cells were kept at 18 degrees C in moisture-saturated dishes for up to 10 h. The animal protocols were approved by the Jichi Medical School Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accord with the Japanese Physiological Society s guidelines for animal care..

First, we demonstrated that ghrelin concentration-dependently increases [Ca2+]i in the NPY-containing neurons and the glucose-sensitive neurons of the ARC. The [Ca2+]i increase often results from depolarization of the plasma membrane and is the key signal for triggering the release of neurotransmitters/hormones and gene expression (27,28). Therefore, the [Ca2+]i increase is a good indicator of neuronal activation. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that ghrelin directly activates NPY neurons and glucose-sensitive neurons in the ARC, the neuronal systems implicated in the stimulation of feeding. We previously showed that the majority of the glucose-sensitive neurons in the ARC were NPY neurons (25).

Furthermore, a specific PKA inhibitor, H89, but not a nonspecific inhibitor, H85, and PKC inhibitors significantly suppressed the ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increase. The results with the PKA inhibitor were obtained mainly from immunocytochemically identified NPY neurons. These results reveal that PKA is required for ghrelin to activate Ca2+ signaling in the NPY neurons of the ARC. There are two possible explanations for the role of PKA. First, the basal activity of PKA may be required for ghrelin to produce Ca2+ signaling. Second, the ghrelin-GHSR system may activate the Gs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA cascade, which in turn leads to the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase. The PKA-mediated facilitation of the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase have been indicated in the cardiac muscle and in pancreatic ss-cells (28,33). It has been shown that PKA is indispensable for CREB phosphorylation and cAMP response element-mediated gene expression in the NPY neurons in the fasted state (34). Ghrelin could couple fasting to the activation of PKA because the release of this peptide is greatly stimulated by fasting (9). These findings in the present study and by others indicate that PKA is important for the ghrelin-induced activation of NPY neurons. Whether the ghrelin-induced Ca2+ signaling in NPY neurons depends on the basal PKA activity or requires activation of PKA by this peptide remains to be clarified..

This is in accord with the report that 57% of the Fos-positive cells in the ventromedial ARC due to intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin were also immunoreactive for the leptin receptor (37). The recently reported action of leptin to antagonize cAMP elevation (38 to 40) is a possible mechanism by which leptin counteracts the effect of ghrelin that is dependent on cAMP-PKA as demonstrated in the present study. The action of leptin could also involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (38 to 41). Furthermore, we found that the orexin-induced [Ca2+]i increase in NPY neurons of the ARC is inhibited by leptin (T.Y., personal communications). Thus, NPY neurons are regulated directly and cooperatively by ghrelin, orexin, and leptin, the important regulators of feeding..

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	64	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to elicit Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms. This could serve as the major neuronal signaling mechanism by which ghrelin stimulates NPY release and thereby feeding. The ghrelin-responsive neurons are highly overlapped with orexin- and leptin-responsive neurons. The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding..

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, has been shown to promote slow-wave sleep (SWS, non-REM sleep stages 3 and 4). Plasma levels of ghrelin are dependent on food intake and increase in sleeping subjects during the early part of the night. It is unknown whether sleep itself affects ghrelin levels or whether circadian networks are involved. Therefore, we studied the effect of sleep deprivation on nocturnal ghrelin secretion. In healthy male volunteers, plasma levels of ghrelin, cortisol, and human growth hormone (hGH) were measured during two experimental sessions of 24 h each: once when the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 and once when they were kept awake throughout the night. During sleep, ghrelin levels increased during the early part of the night and decreased in the morning. This nocturnal increase was blunted during sleep deprivation, and ghrelin levels increased only slightly until the early morning. Ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep correlated positively with peak hGH concentrations. We conclude that the nocturnal increase in ghrelin levels is more likely to be caused by sleep-associated processes than by circadian influences. During the first hours of sleep, ghrelin might promote sleep-associated hGH secretion and contribute to the promotion of SWS..

It is unknown whether sleep itself affects ghrelin levels or whether circadian networks are involved. Therefore, we studied the effect of sleep deprivation on nocturnal ghrelin secretion. In healthy male volunteers, plasma levels of ghrelin, cortisol, and human growth hormone (hGH) were measured during two experimental sessions of 24 h each: once when the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 and once when they were kept awake throughout the night. During sleep, ghrelin levels increased during the early part of the night and decreased in the morning. This nocturnal increase was blunted during sleep deprivation, and ghrelin levels increased only slightly until the early morning. Ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep correlated positively with peak hGH concentrations. We conclude that the nocturnal increase in ghrelin levels is more likely to be caused by sleep-associated processes than by circadian influences. During the first hours of sleep, ghrelin might promote sleep-associated hGH secretion and contribute to the promotion of SWS..

Ghrelin is synthesized mainly in stomach endocrine cells but has also been identified in other tissues, including the hypothalamus (7, 10, 12). Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, increases food intake and appetite, and promotes body weight gain (17, 37, 38). Recent findings suggest that ghrelin might be involved in the regulation of sleep in humans by promoting slow-wave sleep (SWS) (35)..

Once, the subjects were totally sleep deprived, and the other time they were allowed to sleep from 2300 to 0700. The time interval between the two sessions was =" BORDER="0">2 wk. To adjust to the experimental settings, the subjects spent the night before each session (2300 to 0700) in the sleep laboratory. At 0800, electrodes for EEG, electromyogram, and electrooculogram recordings were placed according to standardized criteria (20). The subjects remained in a semirecumbent position and received standardized meals at four different time points. The subjects received a standardized diet from our hospital kitchen with 1,800 kcal/24 h containing 30% fat, 60% carbohydrates, and 10% protein. The subjects were not allowed to eat additional food. Measurements were started at 0900. Subjects stayed in bed for 25 h, until 1000 the next morning. Artificial light intensity was always  < 200 lux. Lights were turned off, and the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 in the sleep condition only. During sleep deprivation, another person stayed continuously in the same room with the subject to prevent lapses into sleep. Standardized meals were served at 0800, 1200, 1900, and again at 0800 the next morning. Water was freely available during the whole experimental session..

Blood samples were taken hourly via an intravenous catheter placed into an antecubital vein, which was kept patent by continuous 0.9% saline infusion containing 400 IU of Na-heparin/l at a rate of 30 ml/h. To minimize disturbances of sleep continuity, blood sampling was done through the wall via a long line from a room adjacent to the sleep laboratory. Blood was collected in tubes, which were stored on ice and contained Na-EDTA (1 mg/ml blood) and aprotinin (300 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml blood). Immediately after withdrawal, blood was centrifuged at 2,600 g for 7 min at 4 degrees C, and plasma was aliquoted and frozen to  to 20 degrees C until the various assays were performed..
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	19	Sleep recordings. To ensure that sleep deprivation was successful, polygraphic recordings were obtained throughout 24 h. All records were visually scored in 30-s epochs with standardized criteria (20) by the same experienced person blind to the experimental condition. During sleep deprivation, none of the subjects displayed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or non-REM sleep stages 2 to 4. The sleep parameters from the sleep phase during the sleep condition are shown in Table 1. Sleep quality and distribution of the different sleep stages were comparable to data from other studies on healthy male volunteers who underwent sleep recordings with intermittent blood sampling (15, 19, 26) (Table 1)..

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	23	Statistics. To compare nocturnal hormone plasma levels between the sleep condition and the sleep deprivation condition, ANOVA for repeated measures was performed with time and condition (sleep vs. sleep deprivation) as within-subject factors. To avoid too many a posteriori tests, which would imply a strong reduction of the level of significance, only five time points between 2300 and 0700 were included (2300, 0100, 0300, 0500, and 0700) in the ANOVA. For each hormone, the averages of the measured plasma concentrations before the sleep period were considered as baseline values, and conditions were tested about significance in them by a separate ANOVA. If, for some hormone, baseline plasma concentrations differed significantly between the two conditions, then all corresponding values in the sleep period had to be normed with the baseline values before the ANOVA application. Additionally, ghrelin levels were compared between conditions by a recently developed methodology for the comparison of the stability of hormone concentration curves (36). Finally, the peak level of hGH between 2300 and 0300 was determined and associated with the ghrelin concentrations between 2300 and 0300 and their area under the curve in this interval as well by using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The level of statistical significance was set to 0.05. One subject had to be excluded from statistical analysis, because no blood samples were available between 2300 and 0500 during the sleep condition due to technical reasons. In the figures, data are depicted as means  plus or minus  SE; in the table, data are given as means  plus or minus  SD..

We confirmed the finding of Cummings et al. (4) that in sleeping subjects ghrelin levels rise during the early part of the night and decline in the morning before breakfast. We discovered, however, that this increase is blunted by sleep deprivation. When subjects stayed awake, ghrelin levels rose slowly and steadily to reach a plateau in the early morning and did not decrease until breakfast. This relative increase of 25% during nocturnal wakefulness was similar to the effects of a 12-h fast observed during the day (1). The suppressive effect of sleep deprivation on ghrelin levels suggests that the bell-shaped time course observed during sleep might not be due to an influence of circadian rhythms but rather might be related to sleep itself. Hence, nocturnal ghrelin secretion shows similarities to hGH production, which is promoted by sleep as well, and particularly by sleep onset (3). In addition, peak hGH levels correlated positively to ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep (Fig. 2), further supporting the idea of a tight interaction..

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	33	Sleep-related growth hormone secretion is probably caused by an increased production of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) acting on the pituitary (28). Ghrelin, in contrast, is produced mainly by the stomach and other splanchnic organs (1, 14). Small quantities might also be produced in the hypothalamus (for review see Ref. 9), but these are very unlikely to contribute to systemic levels (34). Hence, it is almost certain that the increased ghrelin levels that we found in sleeping subjects are due to peripheral production. Yet it is unclear at present how the brain might act on ghrelin-producing cells. Despite the positive correlation between ghrelin and hGH secretion, a causative role of hGH is unlikely, because a number of studies demonstrated that hGH administration does not affect ghrelin levels (2, 8, 16, 30). Studies investigating the interaction between ghrelin production and feeding suggest an influence of vagal cholinergic efferents on ghrelin production and transmission of the ghrelin signal to the brain through vagal afferents (29, 30). These studies indicate a negative influence of the vagus on ghrelin secretion. Therefore, the increased parasympathetic tone occurring during sleep (30) is unlikely to explain increased ghrelin secretion, because the opposite would rather be expected. Hence, although the present results clearly demonstrate increased ghrelin levels during sleep, the question remains to be solved how the sleeping brain stimulates ghrelin secretion. At first glance, it is not easy to understand why the production of an appetite-stimulating hormone should be increased during sleep. However, the interaction among metabolic, endocrine, and sleep-regulating networks is complex, and ghrelin has numerous functions. Ghrelin has recently been shown to increase SWS, and this effect is probably dependent on the GHRH receptor (33, 35). Therefore, ghrelin might represent a peripheral feed-forward signal to support SWS initiation and/or maintenance during the first hours of night sleep in concert with central SWS-promoting actions of GHRH (18). Similarly, ghrelin being a potent growth hormone secretagogue (11) might reinforce the central GHRH signal for enhanced hGH production. This idea is supported by the correlation between hGH and ghrelin production shown in Fig. 2. Studies on the interactions between sleep and neuroendocrine factors date back to the late 1960s (e.g., Ref. 31), but it was only very recently that a particularly intriguing link between sleep and the regulation of appetite became evident. Orexins, hypothalamic peptides that were initially thought mainly to regulate food intake but also to have potent arousing properties (21), play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (a sudden, short-lasting loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions), and an acquired complete loss of hypothalamic orexin production in the hypothalamus in most patients (21). In addition to sleep-related symptoms, patients display various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and hypoleptinemia (23 to 25). Like ghrelin plasma levels, orexin cerebrospinal fluid levels are increased at night (6), and ghrelin-induced food intake is mediated by orexinergic pathways (22). Therefore, it might be of great interest to investigate ghrelin under baseline conditions, in association with sleep and sleep deprivation and in association with meals in narcoleptic patients. To conclude, ghrelin production is enhanced during night sleep in healthy humans and correlates with the increased release of hGH occurring in parallel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the present study further supports the idea that ghrelin is a novel, important player within the sleep-neuroendocrine interplay..

These fibers, which originate from the lateral and posterior hypothalamus and the perifornical area, are distributed in the glomerular, mitral cell, and granule cell layers. Orexin receptors are mainly expressed by mitral cells. In the present study, RT-PCR experiments were done to determine orexin receptor expression during the early postnatal life of rats, and immunocytochemical experiments were performed to further clarify the structural and ultrastructural localization of orexin receptors in the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, a functional electrophysiological approach examined the action of orexin A on mitral cell excitability and spontaneous activity using in vitro patch-clamp techniques. RT-PCR results show that mRNA of the two type receptors, type 1 orexin receptors and type 2 orexin receptors, are expressed in the olfactory bulb of rat from 10 d to the adult stage. At the same ages, immunocytochemical data show that orexin 1 receptors are localized in the cell bodies of periglomerular, mitral/tufted, and granule cells. Immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in mitral/tufted cell dendrites arborizing in the glomerulus and mitral/tufted and granule cell processes running in the external plexiform layer. Functionally, orexin A produced either a direct, tetrodotoxin-insensitive depolarization in one group of mitral cells (7%), or, in another group (30%), an indirect, tetrodotoxin-sensitive hyperpolarization. Both actions were mediated by type 1 orexin receptors because the response was antagonized by SB-334867-A, a selective antagonist. Mitral cell recordings performed under bicuculline [-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist], indicate that the orexin-induced indirect hyperpolarization was partly mediated through GABAA receptors. Because granule cells and periglomerular cells express orexin receptors and are GABAergic cells, they could be both involved in this hyperpolarization. Other mechanisms, which could support an indirect hyperpolarization of mitral cells through dopamine interneuron solicitation, are proposed. Our results provide data that should allow us to better understand neural communication and regulation mechanisms between the hypothalamic feeding centers and the olfactory bulb..

It has been clear for several years that the olfactory system is involved in feeding behavior. The nutritional status of the animal was shown to influence reactivity to food odors of mitral cells; the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). For example, it had been demonstrated that in fasted rats, 70% of mitral cells were stimulated by food odor stimulation vs. 12% for a nonfood odor, whereas in fed animals only 11% responded to food odors (6)..

Indeed, Le Magnen (7) showed that rats increased their food intake if, once satiated, they were presented with differently odorized foods. Moreover, it is an everyday experience for humans and animals that food odors are attractive before feeding, whereas the same stimuli may become neutral or even aversive after feeding. Sensory olfactory inputs are thus crucial in nutrition behavior of humans and animals. Olfactory system involvement begins with the food search step because olfactory sensitivity levels provide the signal detection that allows the animals to follow the concentration gradient toward the food source. Then the olfactory system contributes to the palatability analysis of the food; the appetence of the animal for food is defined by its internal physiological status..

These centers send direct and specific projections to olfactory structures, especially on the olfactory bulb (OB), the first integrative relay of the system (9, 10, 11, 12, 13). The discovery of orexin A (OXA) and B (OXB) or hypocretin I and II (11, 13), two peptides derived from the same prepropeptide and contained in neurons localized in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area, provided new insights into the regulation mechanisms of feeding. Orexin (OX) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area are controlled by changes in circulating nutriment because they are activated by natural hypoglycemic conditions (14) or insulin-induced ones (15), whereas they are inhibited by glucose and signals related to the ingestion of food (15, 16, 17, 18, 19). These data led to the classification of OX neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area as glucose-sensitive neurons (20). Furthermore, OX neurons are stimulated by an increase of circulating lipids. Thus, OX neurons are negatively related to the glucose level but inversely related to circulating fat (21), the latter relation suggesting a role of this peptide in the increased activity associated with a high-fat diet (22, 23)..

Moreover these peptides interact with various neuronal pathways to potentiate apparently divergent functions (for review see Ref. 28). Currently two closely related G protein-coupled receptor types termed type 1 orexin receptors (ORX1) and type 2 orexin receptors (ORX2) have been identified. Although OXA has the same affinity for ORX1 and ORX2, OXB has a 10-fold greater affinity for ORX2 (13, 29, 30)..

Glomeruli are spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery in which primary axons synapse with mitral cells; they are delimited by GABAergic interneurons called periglomerular cells. Granule cells are deep GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. The localization of OXB labeling paralleled that of OXA. However, immunoreactivity to ORX1 and ORX2 were detected only in some mitral/tufted cell bodies, ORX2 labeling being very faint (31). This localization may support, at least partly, data reporting that OB mitral cell reactivity to odors was modulated according to hunger and satiation states in rats (3)..

This study analyzed specifically OX action on mitral cells, its putative cell targets in the OB (31), through an in vitro patch-clamp study. To do so, the actions of OXA and SB-334867-A (ORX1 antagonist; GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, Essex, UK) were tested on the spontaneous activity and excitability of mitral cells. Furthermore, an immunocytochemical study was done to clarify cellular and subcellular localizations of ORX1, the most expressed orexin receptor in the OB. In addition, because no data are available on the early ontogenetic development of orexin innervation and orexin receptors in the OB and because electrophysiological studies on slices were performed on 10- to 25-d-old-rats, the presence of ORX1 was evaluated through RT-PCR experiments on rats and adults that were 10 to 25 postnatal days (P) old. Altogether, the data are expected to provide some enlightenment about the neurochemical modulatory effect of OXA on OB activity and to reveal what cell types of the bulbar network are the targets of orexin innervations. Furthermore, this first functional study is expected to give rise to preliminary hypotheses dealing with the role of the olfactory system in the regulation of food-intake processes..

Our observations confirmed and refined previous description of ORX1 localization in the OB (31). At light microscopic level, ORX1 immunoreactive cells were identified by a dark staining due to the presence of the DAB-nickel reaction product or by green fluorescence in their cytoplasm (Fig. 2F). In P10, P25, and adult rats, ORX1 was distributed with a laminar pattern. ORX1 immunoreactivity was obvious in cell bodies in the glomerular (Fig. 2, A, B, and E), mitral cell, and granule cell layers (Fig. 2, C to F). The immunolabeling was not homogeneous along the mitral cell layer: immunoreactive mitral cells were clustered in patches. In the same way, some glomeruli were ORX1 immunoreactive, whereas others were devoid of immunolabeling. Most often ORX1 immunoreactive glomeruli were located above the immunoreactive zones of the mitral cell layer. In the glomerular layer, most of the immunoreactive cell bodies were found at the base of the glomerulus, just above the external plexiform layer. Some of these neurons were rather elongated in shape, whereas the others were slightly smaller and round. Some of these round neurons were also observed around the glomerulus. According to their location, these neurons could correspond to external tufted cells and periglomerular cells (PGs), respectively. In semifine sections, brown dots probably corresponding to mitral cell dendrites appeared dispersed in the external plexiform layer (EPL) and inside glomeruli. In sections in which the primary antiserum has been omitted, no immunolabeling was observed..

The presence of ORX1 in the OB was checked on semithin sections obtained from 50- microm sections embedded in epoxy resin (adults, A to D) and on thin sections (14  microm) (P10 rat, E; P25 rat, F). The semithin sections were observed either stained with Toluidine blue (1  microm thick, A and C) or without any counterstaining (2  microm thick, B and D). The presence of ORX1 was visualized by a dark DAB (A to D) or DAB-nickel staining spread in the cytoplasm of immunoreactive (ir) cells (E) or a green fluorescence (F; blue staining: 4',6'-diamino-2-phenylindole nuclear coloration). ORX1 ir-cell bodies were identified in all layers, except the olfactory nerve layer. In the glomerular layer (A and B, x40 immersion), ir-cell bodies were observed around the glomeruli. Large elongated cell bodies mostly located at the basis of the glomeruli could be external tufted cell (large arrows), whereas small round cell bodies on the border could be identified as PG cells (thin arrows). Inside the glomeruli, brown dots are likely mitral cells dendrites (arrowheads). In the mitral cell layer, the cytoplasm of some mitral cells was highly ir (large arrows, C and D, x40 immersion). Some mitral cells did not express ORX1 (arrowheads, C and D). In some sections the mitral cell nucleus was apparent and devoid of immunolabeling (C and D). Some granule cells were ORX1-ir (E and F). In the EPL a punctiform DAB-labeling (thin arrows in 2D) corresponded presumably to mitral cell dendrites. bc, Blood capillary; GCL, granular cell layer; GL, glomeruli; MCL, mitral cell layer; n, nucleus..

In the mitral cell layer, rather few mitral cell bodies (characterized by their typical and abundant stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum) were ORX1 labeled. However, in ORX1 immunoreactive mitral cells, labeling was obvious and consisted of numerous patches localized both between cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum and in the neighborhood of the plasma membrane, indicating that ORX1 is locally synthesized and folded at membrane (Fig. 3B). In the EPL, immunolabeling was shown in mitral cell and granule cell dendrites (Fig 3C) and reciprocal synapses between ORX1 immunoreactive mitral cells, and granule cell dendrites could be observed (Fig. 3D); the accumulation of labeling near the synapse should be noted..

In Fig. 6, C and D, it can be seen that OXA caused a cessation of spontaneous firing in the control, whereas in the presence of bicuculline, it only slowed down spontaneous firing. Bicuculline decreased the amplitude of OXA hyperpolarizing responses by 17 to 75% (n = 14). Picrotoxin (n = 5) had similar effects to bicuculline (data not shown). When the ACSF perfusion contained SB-334867-A (ORX1 antagonist), hyperpolarizing responses were completely blocked (n = 4; Fig. 7, A and B). Altogether the results indicate that the hyperpolarizing effect of OXA is an indirect effect. OXA may act through ORX1 on GABAergic neurons that would act in turn on mitral cell GABAA receptors. Consistent with this hypothesis, bicuculline decreased the OXA hyperpolarizing effect in mitral cells..

Orexin depolarizations were insensitive to TTX (n = 2; Fig. 8B). To examine this depolarizing effect in detail, subsequent experiments were conducted under voltage-clamp conditions. When the membrane potential was voltage clamped at, or near, its resting level, OXA produced an inward current whose delay and duration matched those of the OXA-induced depolarizations (Fig. 9A). This inward current was blocked by SB-334867-A (n = 3; Fig. 9B). These experiments indicate that the OXA depolarizing action on mitral cells is direct and mediated through ORX1..

However, until now, no data about the development of orexin innervation and orexin receptor expression were available in this tissue. Through RT-PCR experiments, we present information of orexin receptor mRNA in the OB during early postnatal development. Our results indicate that both ORX1 and ORX2 are expressed as early as 10 d after birth (P10) and their presence is shown until the adult stage both in control tissues (HYPO) and OB. Although only a quantitative RT-PCR could lead us to a more definitive conclusion, our study suggests that both ORX1 and ORX2 are expressed at a lower level in OB, compared with HYPO. Noteworthy is that our results show a stable level of ORX1 expression before weaning as well as in adults. Other brain tissues, such as hypoglossal neurons (42) or hypothalamus (43), show higher expression levels at P20 to 25 and a stable level thereafter. From a functional point of view, Van den Pol et al.

At light microscopic level, our immunocytochemical study confirms the localization of ORX1 in mitral/tufted cell bodies reported by Caillol et al. (31). At the ultrastructural level, the localization of orexin receptors has been not widely studied; there is only one recent publication in the arcuate nucleus (45). Our results are in agreement with this study showing that ORX1 was localized in cell bodies as well as at the pre- and postsynaptic levels.

ORX1 immunoreactivity was also shown in mitral/tufted cell dendrites running in the EPL and in bodies and processes of external tuft cells and periglomerular and granule cells.

From the olfactory mucosa, olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) send their axons to the OB terminating in glomeruli (GLO), spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery. Within glomeruli, these axons synapse with primary dendrites (pd) of mitral cells (MC). Mitral cells make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with the two categories of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons; through their pd with PGs and through their secondary dendrites (sd) with granule cells (GC). So mitral cell activity can be modulated through a double-GABAergic control before sending their axon (a) to the olfactory cortex. ORX1 is found to be expressed by subsets of MC, PG, and GC (cells in dark gray) and tufted cells (Tc, in light gray), these receptors being localized in the soma and processes of these neurons. Left, The diagram schematizes the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA on MC: OXA, by acting through ORX1, is hypothesized to depolarize GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, PGs, or GCs (in dark gray), which in turn would inhibit MCs (in white) via a GABA release acting on GABAA receptors localized on the MC. Within glomeruli, a part of OXA indirect hyperpolarizing action can also be ascribed to action of GABA released by PGs on GABAB receptors localized both on ORN axons or MCs (pd). Right, The diagram is schematizes the direct depolarizing action of OXA on MC; OXA, by acting through ORX1 expressed by a subset of mitral cells, is hypothesized to depolarize MC (dark gray)..

These OXA effects were either excitatory or inhibitory..
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	77	We show that the OXA hyperpolarizing response was partly antagonized by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. This result indicates that GABAergic interneurons are involved in the OXA-induced hyperpolarization of mitral cells. Our immunocytochemical observations that some PG and granule cell bodies express ORX1 support that these GABAergic interneurons could be contacted by orexin fibers localized mainly in glomerular layer and feebly in granule cell layer (31). Indeed, PG and granule cells, the main interneurons of these two layers, are mainly GABAergic (49, 50) and have been shown to inhibit mitral cells by activation of GABAA receptors (51, 52). Along the same line, GABAergic interneurons that are excited by OXA may act on metabotropic GABAB receptors. Indeed, GABAB receptor activation was reported elsewhere to both abolish completely spontaneous activity in mitral cells and decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks applied in the olfactory nerve layer (33, 53, 54)..

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	79	In the present study, OXA was also observed to decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks. For such an effect, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on extrasynaptic presynaptic GABAB receptors located on primary afferent axons (55, 56) in which it is strongly suspected to act by depressing neurotransmitter release (54, 57, 58, 59, 60). On the other hand, for decreasing mitral cell spontaneous activity, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on GABAB receptors located either on the soma or dendritic intraglomerular tuft of rat mitral cells (55, 56). One of the mechanisms by which GABAB would silence the spontaneous activity may be that GABAB would slightly hyperpolarize mitral cells at rest, shifting the cell polarization from the up-state to the down-state, the latter signaling a steady silent state (61). Because dopamine and GABA are colocalized in some PG interneurons (62, 63, 64), dopamine also would be a good candidate to support the OXA indirect inhibition of mitral cells. Consistent with this hypothesis is that, in the frog OB, dopamine was found to inhibit mitral cell spontaneous activity (65). A coaction of GABA and dopamine cannot be ruled out..

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	81	An especially interesting fact is that our electrophysiological results are fully consistent with those of an in vivo study (48). The authors recorded unit extracellular activity of mitral cells in anesthetized rats, whereas they applied OXA directly on the OB surface or in the lateral ventricle. Both types of applications were shown to induce a decrease in spontaneous rate of some cells or an increase in others distinct cells. Noteworthy is that in both in vivo and in vitro studies, OXA induces two types of opposite actions on mitral cell spontaneous activity..

In addition, our in vitro recordings demonstrate that OXA acts on mitral cells both directly and indirectly inducing apparently opposite effects. The direct depolarizing effect could be mediated by ORX1 located on mitral cell bodies and dendrites. ORX1 located on PG and granular cells could be responsible for the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA via GABA-induced release..

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	85	Altogether our data provide new insights for apprehending some of the mechanisms by which the olfactory system is involved in the regulation of food-intake behavior. In hungry animals, hypothalamic OX neurons are stimulated by hypoglycemia (14) and probably increase their release through centrifugal pathways. Our electrophysiological data detail OX action in OB. Indeed, by acting both directly by increasing output neuron s background activity and, indirectly through inhibitory interneuron networks, OX can both depress and excite mitral cells. These two opposite actions are shown to occur in two distinct mitral cell sets. OX may provide for selective and dual actions in olfactory information processing, favoring mitral cells involved in the food-odor processing and silencing others that are not involved. This duality of action could result in increasing signal to noise ratio and may increase olfactory detection power. This hypothesis fully agrees with behavioral experiments, which are in progress by our research team. Indeed, preliminary results indicate that olfactory detection thresholds of rats are enhanced by OXA intracerebral injection..

DO ALL COMMON DISEASES... LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM THE FUTURE OF HUMAN... REFERENCES   A better understanding of the allelic structure of common human disease loci may help identification of the responsible genes, and is thus a topic of considerable practical importance. If few alleles at each locus account for the majority of disease risk, then screening for these causative factors will be greatly simplified. In contrast, if large numbers of independent alleles are responsible, dramatic improvements in genotyping speed will be necessary, placing the dream of personalized medicine far in the future. In this review, the evidence for and against the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints is discussed. It appears that neither position has been proved or disproved, but the available evidence indicates that common diseases are due at least in part to genes with a small number of disease-associated alleles..
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	4	One of the early dreams of the human genome project was the goal of personalized medicine. The vision was that each individual would have a compact disk containing their own unique DNA sequence, guiding myriad decisions on lifestyle, disease prevention, treatment and conceivably even career choice. At present, DNA sequencing technology is nowhere near cheap enough or fast enough to allow this dream. Nevertheless, genotyping technologies have made dramatic strides over the last decade, and these technologies may now be fast enough to allow interrogation of all relevant disease alleles in any given individual. The feasibility of this approach depends critically on the allelic structure of human disease genes. If all 30 000 genes make important contributions to disease susceptibility, and there are 1000 alleles for each gene, then a total of 3x107 genotypings will have to be reliably performed a daunting prospect. However, if only 1000 genes make appreciable contributions to human disease, and each of these genes has only 4 relevant alleles, then the number of genotypings to be performed is only 4000 highly feasible. In this review, we look at the present knowledge on the allelic complexity of human disease genes, as well as providing a brief glance to the future..

ALLELIC STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX... DO ALL COMMON DISEASES... LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM THE FUTURE OF HUMAN... REFERENCES   A perhaps oversimplified aid to visualizing the properties of human disease genes is provided in Figure 1. This figure depicts a three-dimensional allelic space, with the axes of disease frequency, number of responsible loci and mean number of alleles at each locus. Regarding the second axis, number of responsible loci, genetic traits are traditionally divided into monogenic (single gene or simple trait), polygenic (many genes), and multifactorial or complex (interactions between multiple genes and environment). Because a single locus is responsible for the monogenic disorders, identification of the relevant loci is usually straightforward, provided that a sufficient number of multiplex families are available. In contrast, the genetics of complex traits remains murky, and success in identifying the responsible loci has been elusive. This is because many genes and environment conspire together in a series of complicated epistatic and synergistic relationships to cause the final disease phenotype. In general, the number of loci identified through linkage for any given complex disease trait is less than 10, but linkage can be expected to identify only the major contributing loci. Since, with very few exceptions, the genes responsible for complex traits have yet to be identified, it remains an open question as to the number of alleles at each locus..

This three-dimensional space provides an aid to visualizing possible structures of polymorphism for human disease genes. For monogenic disorders, rare diseases (green bar) have complex allelic spectra (high number of alleles per locus), while common diseases (yellow bar) have simple spectra (low number of alleles per locus). Special cases (gray bar) exist in situations such as heterozygous advantage and population bottlenecks. For common complex disease traits, the situation is less clear. Two extreme models are the interaction model (CD/CV hypothesis, dark blue bar) and the genetic heterogeneity model (red bar). However, two other extreme models are also formally possible: a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), and a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles (magenta bar). Considerations of human population genetics (2) suggest that one of the four extreme models, a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), is unlikely. However, present data are insufficient to confidently place complex disease traits between the remaining three extremes, indicated by the two-dimensional gray surface. In this figure, the following examples are employed (2, 10): monogenic (rare) retinoblastoma; monogenic (common) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (South China); monogenic (special case) ss-thalassemia (Sardinia); complex (interaction model) Alzheimer's disease (speculative); complex (genetic heterogeneity model) colon cancer (speculative). No known examples yet exist for the two hypothetical cases of common complex diseases caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles or a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles. For clarity, the disease frequencies for both the monogenic and common complex disorders have been rounded to 10-1, but all are within one order of magnitude of the known frequency. In the cases of the complex diseases, Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer, the assigned values for the number of loci and the number of alleles per locus are highly speculative. For the purposes of the figure, it has been assumed that Alzheimer's disease is an example of the interaction model, whereas colon cancer is an example of the genetic heterogeneity model. Although both assumptions are conjectural, there is some evidence in favor of the genetic heterogeneity model for cancer (10)..
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	8	  Two extreme models are usually envisaged for complex disease traits (Fig. 1) (1). One idea is that common alleles at a handful of loci interact to cause disease. This is referred to as the interaction model or the common disease/common variant (CD/CV) hypothesis. The competing notion is that rare alleles at numerous loci can each single-handedly cause the disease. This is referred to as the genetic heterogeneity model. Two other extreme models are also formally possible: complex disease traits are caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles, or they are caused by a large number of loci with a large number of alleles (Fig. 1). One of these last two alternatives (a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles) is rendered unlikely by considerations of human population structure (see below). However, between the remaining three extremes, complex disease traits could occupy any middle ground..

In addition, this work provides some justification for the CD/CV hypothesis..
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	10	There is a large amount of evidence suggesting a dramatic expansion of the human population 18 000 to 150 000 years or 700 to 6000 generations ago. This resulted in an increased effective population size from 104 individuals to the present size of 6x109. Assume expansion of one allele of a rare disease gene, and one allele of a common gene (Fig. 2A). With some notable exceptions, the available evidence suggests fairly similar mutation rates for most genes, 10-6 to 10-5 per gene per generation (3 to 7). For the rare disease, the number of individuals in the expanded population is still small, and hence in relative terms they are quickly swamped by newly mutated alleles. In contrast, the population reservoir for the common disease gene is large, and it takes a long time for these alleles to be taken over by new mutations. In addition, in the face of similar mutation rates, the lower prevalence of rare diseases implies a higher allele disappearance rate (negative selection) for these diseases than for common diseases. Both of these effects (reservoir effect and selection pressure) imply that after the population expansion, allelic spectra became diverse much more quickly for the rare diseases than the common. In the long run, however, it is expected that the spectra for both rare and common diseases will become equally diverse (Fig. 2B). Reich and Lander estimate that an intermediate stage presently exists in the population, where rare diseases have very diverse allelic structure but the common disorders have simple structure. A prediction of this theory is that rare disorders will largely consist of recent alleles whereas common disorders will consist of old (ancestral) alleles..

(A) A dramatic population expansion leads to increased numbers of individuals with a single allele of a rare (5 squares) and common (25 circles) disease gene. Because the rare disease gene is under strong negative selection, three alleles disappear in the population, and are replaced by three new alleles. Thus, only 2/5 (40%) of alleles represent the ancestral allele. In contrast, the common disease gene is under much less strong negative selection, and only one allele is lost to be replaced by three new alleles. The proportion of ancestral alleles is hence 24/27 (89%). Consequently, the common disease gene has a much simpler allelic structure in the present population than the rare gene. (B) Graphical depiction of (A). The population expansion leads to proportionate increases of a single allele of a common disease gene (red) and a rare disease gene (blue). In the present human population, the rapid loss of alleles and smaller population reservoir of the rare disease gene has lead to the allelic spectrum of this gene becoming relatively much more diverse than the common gene. However, in the far distant future (at equilibrium), the common disease gene can be expected to catch up with the rare gene, and the allelic spectra of both genes will be equally diverse..

ALLELIC STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX... DO ALL COMMON DISEASES... LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM THE FUTURE OF HUMAN... REFERENCES   Since  > 1000 Mendelian (monogenic) disease genes have been identified, our understanding of their complexity is considerable. In general, rare diseases with strong negative selection exhibit very large allelic diversity (8). An exception to the pattern of high allelic diversity for rare disorders is when these alleles also provide heterozygous advantage. One example is provided by the thalassemias, which confer resistance to malaria. Once arisen, the strong positive selective pressure conferred by these single alleles ensures their relatively rapid spread through the population. Another exception to the high allelic diversity of rare disorders occurs if a population bottleneck results in greatly simplified spectra. For example, among Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations, there are numerous examples of disease where individual alleles show greatly elevated frequencies compared with other populations. Overall then, for monogenic disorders there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions of Reich and Lander (2) and the available data..

ALLELIC STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX... DO ALL COMMON DISEASES... LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM THE FUTURE OF HUMAN... REFERENCES   For common complex disorders, there are relatively few data on the diversity of allelic spectra due to the difficulty in identifying the responsible genes. The few known examples, however, tend to support the interaction model and the CD/CV hypothesis, since most of these genes have a small number of common, disease-associated alleles (Table 1). With a couple of possible exceptions, the genes/loci listed in Table 1 have been confirmed in multiple studies and are unlikely to represent type 1 errors. It should be noted, however, that the listed genes may not be fully representative of common disease genes, since genes with a small number of common alleles would be easier to identify by association than genes with a large number of rare alleles..

Three lines of evidence supporting the common disease/common variant hypothesis   Another valid test of the CD/CV hypothesis is to examine the genetic complexity of quantitative traits related to common disease, such as blood pressure, body mass index and plasma lipids. One well-studied group of phenotypes comprises the levels and compositions of plasma lipoproteins, which are strongly associated with coronary heart disease. With the exception of mutations of the LDL receptor that underlie familial hypercholesterolemia (a relatively common monogenic disorder), most of the known variations associated with the traits are due to a small number of common alleles (Table 1)..
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	16	A corollary of the CD/CV hypothesis is that each individual will carry susceptibility genes for numerous disorders. This point is difficult to examine systematically in humans, although, clearly, older individuals frequently suffer from a host of common maladies. A more convincing example is provided by surveying inbred mouse strains for differences in disease-related traits. Table 1 lists some common diseases and related traits differing between the two inbred strains DBA/2J and C57BL/6J. Many of these traits have been analyzed in genetic crosses between the two strains, and are known to be due to multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL). One might argue that, since the mice have been maintained by continuous brother to sister mating for many generations, numerous mutations have been fixed, and these are responsible for the trait differences. A counter argument to this, however, is the fact that a number of the loci observed in the DBA/2JxC57BL/6J cross are also observed in crosses with other strains, and, in some cases, these loci are syntenic with human loci for the corresponding traits (9)..

In addition, many common diseases exhibit a high ratio of relative risk for monozygotic twins to that for dizygotic twins, also consistent with the genetics of the multifactorial threshold model (2,10). However, there are exceptions. For example, the common disease familial combined hyperlipidemia (prevalence 1 to 2%) exhibits an apparent dominant mode of inheritance through many generations, yet is clearly very complex (11). Furthermore, the inheritance of cancers is, in some ways, more consistent with a heterogeneity model (see below)..

These loci contribute to a relatively common genetic disorder, but have many different rare mutations, even in the Ashkenazi population (see above). In addition, even when the CD/CV hypothesis is true, disease genes may be dominated by a few alleles, but have large numbers of minor alleles. In the case of cystic fibrosis, 67% of disease alleles in the Caucasian population are accounted for by a single mutation. Nevertheless, the total number of known disease alleles exceeds 100 (8)..

ALLELIC STRUCTURE OF SIMPLE... ALLELIC STRUCTURE OF COMPLEX... DO ALL COMMON DISEASES... LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM THE FUTURE OF HUMAN... REFERENCES   The general allelic architecture of various diseases or classes of genes may differ depending on the biological mechanisms involved. Mitchison (13) has made the analogy between mutations in coding regions (hardware) and mutations in regulatory regions (software). He further divides genes into extrovert, concerned with the outside world (e.g. immunoglobulins and olfactory receptors) and the more numerous introvert genes, concerned with cellular homeostasis (e.g. transcription, signal transduction and neurotransmission). Mitchison suggests that for extrovert genes, hardware variation (coding regions) is more common, while for introvert genes, most genetic variation has mild effects and occurs in the software (regulatory regions). Many instances of promoter variation (software) are found in pharmacogenomics and psychiatry (14). One example is provided by a 44 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene. This polymorphism has been associated with affective illness and anxiety-related traits, and also alters 5-HTT gene expression, since the short promoter is less active than the long promoter. Another example of promoter polymorphism is found in the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene. This gene displays variations in the number of (G+C)-rich Sp1 and Egr-1 transcription factor-binding sites, which influence promoter efficiency through methylation (15). The resulting variations in 5-LO levels may be relevant to the inflammatory response in asthma (16)..

With few exceptions, different cancers have roughly the same familial relative risk (FRR), although the FRR increases with early age of onset. Traditionally, most studies attribute a large environmental component to cancer. The relevant evidence includes such observations as dramatic shifts in cancer incidence due to population migrations. However, careful evaluation of twin and family studies suggest that genetics also plays a large part in cancer risk (10). A key quantity is RMD, the FRR ratio between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. The idea is that MZ and DZ twins have a comparable sharing of environmental factors, so any difference in concordance rates between MZ and DZ twins must reflect genetic factors. For disease due to a single rare dominant gene, RMD=2, and for a recessive rare gene, RMD=4 but diminishes toward 2 if the allele is very common. For multiple loci, RMD can become very large. For most cancers, RMD2, compared with much higher ratios for many complex diseases such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, and autism. These data are consistent with either rare dominant alleles or additive gene effects for cancer, rather than an interactive, multigenic model..

REFERENCES   Related to the CV/CD hypothesis is the idea that diagnostic costs can be reduced to manageable levels using linkage disequilibrium. The idea here is that the great population expansion is sufficiently recent that large blocks of haplotypes are likely to be conserved between genomes. If true, this would greatly reduce the density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) required for association studies and the expense of genotyping. An implicit assumption of this approach is that common haplotypes are responsible for common diseases..

In addition, somatic cell genetics has been used to analyze LD over the entire chromosome 21 (19). From LD sampling, the average distance over which useful LD was preserved was 50 to 60 kb. However, there was considerable variability, and in some loci, LD was found as far away as 500 kb, while in other regions, no useful disequilibrium was found. The chromosome 21 study found considerable linkage disequilibrium, with long blocks of conserved haplotypes. Interestingly, greater than 80% of the haplotype structure could be defined by less than 10% of the SNPs.

Although a region of linkage disequilibrium associated with the disease was identified, a lack of recombination events within the relevant haplotype block precluded identification of the responsible gene. Thus, although the existence of large haplotype blocks is good news from the point- of- view of cheap diagnostics, it may hinder definitive identification of the responsible genes and any associated biological insights. In this situation, the use of alternate populations may come to the rescue, allowing subdivision of large regions of linkage disequilibrium. For narcolepsy, it was possible to identify a recombination event in a Japanese family that broke up a haplotype block in the HLA region, allowing finer mapping of the responsible gene (21).

With present limitations on the speed of genotyping and lack of knowledge of the genetic causation of common human disease, the best choice between these two alternatives is unclear. Of course, the optimal situation would be to know the answer to both questions. Thus, the need for ever more rapid genotyping and sequencing technologies is likely to continue for the foreseeable future..

The severe X-linked form is attributed to more than 200 different mutations in the myotubularin encoding gene (MTM1). In contrast, there are no reports regarding the molecular etiology or linkage studies on the autosomal forms of the disease. Labrador retrievers affected by spontaneous centronuclear myopathy (cnm) have clinical and histological features of the human disorder and represent the first model of recessive autosomal centronuclear myopathy. We previously mapped the cnm locus to the centromeric region of canine chromosome 2. No gene of the MTM1 family maps to the human homologous chromosomal region. Described herein is a disease-associated insertion within PTPLA exon 2, found in both alleles of all affected Labradors and in a single allele in obligate carriers. The inserted tRNA-derived short interspersed repeat element (SINE) has a striking effect on the maturation of PTPLA mRNA, whereby it can be spliced out, partially exonized or involved in multiple exon-skipping. As a result, the amount of wild-type transcripts falls to 1% in affected muscles. This example therefore recapitulates cumulative SINE-associated transcriptional defects that have been previously described as exclusive consequences of independent mutations. Although the function of PTPLA in metazoa remains unknown, the characterization of a hypomorphic mutation in Labradors with centronuclear myopathy provides new clues about the molecular complexity of skeletal myofiber homeostasis. These results also suggest that impaired PTPLA signaling might be implicated in human myopathies..

Hallmarks of the disease include generalized muscle weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia externa, areflexia, muscular atrophy affecting predominantly type 1 myofibers, nuclei centralization and pale central zones with variably staining granules (1 to 3). Genetic heterogeneity is correlated with the onset and severity of the disease. A significant proportion of infants affected by the severe X-linked form (called myotubular myopathy or XLMTM, OMIM no. 310400) die at a few months of age following respiratory failure (4,5). Eighty percent of survivors become dependent on artificial ventilation and suffer from medical complications (5). Autosomal dominant and recessive forms (OMIM no. 255200) run a milder course, the recessive form being intermediate between the X-linked and the dominant forms (2,6). The XLMTM locus was initially mapped to Xq28 (7) and mutations in the Myotubularin (MTM1) gene were associated with the disease (8). To date, a spectrum of 200 disease-associated mutations in MTM1 account for the very severe to mild phenotype observed in XLMTM patients (9). MTM1 encodes myotubularin, which contains the consensus sequence for the tyrosine phosphatase catalytic site (8). However, this protein seems to essentially act in muscles as a phosphoinositide phosphatase, which specifically dephosphorylates the lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) (10 to 12) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,5P2) (13,14). Myotubularin is the first identified member of a large protein family that comprises 13 other known members in human, named myotubularin-related 1 to 13 (MTMR1 to MTMR13). Mutations in MTMR2 and MTMR13 have been associated with Charcot to Marie to Tooth demyelinating diseases (15 to 17) and reinforce a central role of phosphoinositides in neuromuscular homeostasis (reviewed in 18). The MTM1 protein family encompasses both active and inactive members and recent reports have suggested functional cooperation between these two groups (18 to 23).

The myopathy is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disease (28 to 30). Clinical features in male and female pups include hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, abnormal postures, stiff hopping gait, exercise intolerance and increased collapse when exposed to cold (see movie published as Supplementary Material at HMG Online). On examination, there is evidence of skeletal muscle atrophy, particularly involving muscles of the head and tendinous areflexia. Metabolic and shape remodeling of the muscles is observed with type 2 fibers deficiency and predominance of atrophic or hypertrophic type 1 fibers (24,25,28,29). In all reported cases, histopathological evaluation of muscle biopsies has demonstrated a characteristic centralization of myonuclei, often located in areas devoid of myofibrils with mitochondrial aggregation. Centronuclear myopathy (cnm) was therefore proposed as an alternative name for the HMLR (29) and is, to our knowledge, the only spontaneous animal model for human autosomal centronuclear myopathies..

In all reported cases, histopathological evaluation of muscle biopsies has demonstrated a characteristic centralization of myonuclei, often located in areas devoid of myofibrils with mitochondrial aggregation. Centronuclear myopathy (cnm) was therefore proposed as an alternative name for the HMLR (29) and is, to our knowledge, the only spontaneous animal model for human autosomal centronuclear myopathies..

We report here a mutation in the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase-like, member A (PTPLA) that perfectly segregates with cnm in Labrador retrievers of our experimental pedigree. Indeed, a tRNA-like short interspersed repeat element (SINE) insertion was identified in exon 2 of PTPLA that leads to multiple transcriptional alterations of the SINE-containing PTPLA allele.

None of these is a member of the MTM1 family. Hence, we focused on genes expressed in skeletal muscles, in a temporal window compatible with the early postnatal symptoms diagnosed in affected dogs. Among these genes, PTPLA was shown to be expressed during embryogenesis in murine myogenic precursors (32) and in adult skeletal muscles of both mouse and human (32,33). Furthermore, PTPLA was annotated as a phosphatase coding gene as PTPLA protein contains a putative phosphatase-like domain, with a proline instead of an arginine in the catalytic site.

The following data were taken into consideration when designing the experiments detailed subsequently. Canine PTPLA spans  > 20 kb and contains seven exons (Fig. 1A), a structure shared with its human (33) and murine orthologs (see Ensembl Gene ID ENSMUSG00000063275). In dog skeletal muscles, PTPLA transcripts exist in two isoforms (Fig. 1B) differing by the retention (PTPLAfl, full-length, EMBL accession no. AJ876904) or the exclusion of exon 5 (PTPLAd5, deleted exon 5, EMBL accession no. AJ876905). PTPLAfl transcript encodes a putative protein of 249 amino acids that contains four transmembrane domains and the putative tyrosine phosphatase-like (HCX2GX2P) catalytic site (Fig. 1C). Exon 5 skipping in the PTPLAd5 transcript leads to frame disruption and premature translation termination. The resulting predicted PTPLAD5 protein contains two transmembrane domains and the putative tyrosine phosphatase-like (HCX2GX2P) catalytic site. PTPLAFL and PTPLAD5 proteins share a common 125 amino acids N-terminus domain and differ by their C-terminus regions, 124 amino acids and 11 amino acids in length, respectively (Fig. 1C)..

A representative panel of the resulting PCR products is presented in Fig. 2C and complete amplifications from 46 animals, among which 22 are affected dogs, are provided in Supplementary Material, Fig. S1.

Few SINE insertions within coding sequences have been reported.

Both PTPLAfl and PTPLAd5 transcripts were amplified from cnm+/+ and cnm+/ to  samples (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, a ladder-like profile with seven RT to PCR products was obtained from cnm to / to  samples (Fig. 4A, lane 3). All seven amplicons were cloned and sequenced to precisely determine acceptor and donor splicing sites used for the synthesis of the corresponding transcripts in cnm to / to  muscles (Fig. 4B). Figure 4C proposes a classification of the PTPLA transcripts based on their splicing profile and the predicted proteins. As far as cnm to / to  dogs are concerned, RT to PCR products corresponding to PTPLAfl and PTPLAd5 wt isoforms were observed, which indicates that the SINE was occasionally spliced out. Furthermore, no point mutation could be detected in these transcripts, indicating that wt and cnm-associated PTPLA alleles only differ by the SINE insertion.

Two PTPLA genomic fragments spanning from intron 1 to intron 4, which differed by the absence or presence of the SINE insertion were cloned into pSPL3 exon-trapping vector (Fig. 5A). Both plasmids, termed pCOS-cnm and pCOS-wt, respectively, were transfected into COS-7 cells and the resulting transcripts were analyzed by RT to PCR. When the pCOS-wt plasmid was used, RT to PCR and nested PCR products corresponded to a properly spliced transcript containing PTPLA exons 2, 3 and 4 flanked by the two 5'- and 3'-ss-globin exons from the vector (Fig. 5B). SacI digestion confirmed the presence of PTPLA exon 4 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, only smaller products were observed after RT to PCR and nested PCR when total RNAs from COS-7 cells transfected with the SINE-containing plasmid (pCOS-cnm) were used as template. SacI digestion suggested that PTPLA exon 4 was present in these products (Fig. 5B). This hypothesis was confirmed by sequence analysis. Indeed, the smaller size of the transcripts resulted from the absence of PTPLA exon 2.

Two PTPLA genomic fragments spanning from intron 1 to intron 4, which differed by the absence or presence of the SINE insertion were cloned into pSPL3 exon-trapping vector (Fig. 5A). Both plasmids, termed pCOS-cnm and pCOS-wt, respectively, were transfected into COS-7 cells and the resulting transcripts were analyzed by RT to PCR. When the pCOS-wt plasmid was used, RT to PCR and nested PCR products corresponded to a properly spliced transcript containing PTPLA exons 2, 3 and 4 flanked by the two 5'- and 3'-ss-globin exons from the vector (Fig. 5B). SacI digestion confirmed the presence of PTPLA exon 4 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, only smaller products were observed after RT to PCR and nested PCR when total RNAs from COS-7 cells transfected with the SINE-containing plasmid (pCOS-cnm) were used as template. SacI digestion suggested that PTPLA exon 4 was present in these products (Fig. 5B). This hypothesis was confirmed by sequence analysis. Indeed, the smaller size of the transcripts resulted from the absence of PTPLA exon 2. Additional RT to PCR experiments revealed only a very low level of wt transcript containing PTPLA exons 2, 3 and 4 (data not shown)..

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	59	In our experiments, PTPLA was expressed in canine skeletal muscles at all tested stages from birth to adulthood (data not shown). This temporal expression pattern is compatible with the clinical and histological evolution of the disease in affected dogs. Furthermore, we observed a homozygous tRNA-like SINE insertion within PTPLA exon 2 of affected dogs. In the human genome, Alu elements are the most abundant SINEs and numerous Alu insertions into genes have been associated with hereditary disorders (36). Not all of these cases have been demonstrated to be directly causative for the disease, but the lack of other detectable mutation and the rarity of such Alu insertions strongly suggest that they are a likely candidate. In the case of the Labrador retriever centronuclear myopathy, two lines of reasoning suggest that the SINE exonic insertion is responsible for the disease. First, the SINE insertion identified in our pedigree of Labrador retriever perfectly segregates with the disease. We have sampled 47 healthy dogs from 15 pure and mixed breeds and failed to detect this insertion. In particular, the SINE insertion was not found in nine healthy French Labrador retrievers unrelated to our experimental pedigree. The presence of the retroposed SINE within PTPLA is therefore highly correlated with the segregation of centronuclear myopathy in French Labrador retrievers. Second, and most compellingly, we show that the repeat element insertion severely affects the splicing of the corresponding SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele. We provide strong evidence that the tRNA-like SINE is by itself responsible for cumulative transcriptional abnormalities based on the four following features: (i) the SINE can be properly spliced, although at a low level ( < 1%); (ii) partial exonization of the SINE; (iii) exon-skipping involving several exons and (iv) the total amount of PTPLA transcripts was markedly reduced. Taken together, these observations show that the exonic SINE insertion within the PTPLA gene in cnm to / to  dogs acts as a hypomorphic mutation. Existing data and ongoing experiments should help us to confirm that the SINE insertion within PTPLA is a causative event leading to canine centronuclear myopathy. First, our experimental pedigree has been established from two affected Labradors that are unrelated for 11 generations (29). We have found that both dogs are homozygotes for the same insertion within PTPLA exon 2. Genotyping additional affected Labradors coming to the Alfort clinics will allow us to reinforce the association between the SINE insertion and cnm. We also believe that close clinical and histopathological relationships exist between the centronuclear myopathy found in French Labrador retrievers and the HMLR identified in dogs from other countries (29). Although not precisely determined yet, the number of generations from common ancestors of affected Labradors from the USA and France is higher than between affected French dogs. Amplifying the SINE insertion in affected Labrador retrievers from the USA or from any other country will reinforce that the SINE insertion is the causative-disease mutation with founder effect. Finally, characterization of mutations in PTPLA with similar phenotype either in transgenic mice or in human patients affected by autosomal recessive cnm would provide strong evidence that PTPLA plays a central role in the etiology of centronuclear myopathy..

Classical and tissue-specific gene-targeting inactivation of Mtm1 in the mouse confirmed that the absence of muscular expression of Mtm1 does not affect myogenesis but induces lethal degeneration of skeletal muscles by 4 weeks of age (45). Myotubularin is a phosphatase with dual activity that specifically dephosphorylates subpools of phosphatidylinositols (PIs) (10,11,13,14). PIs are implicated in a number of physiological processes including cell proliferation, death, motility, cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular vesicle trafficking (46). Ptpla was first annotated in mouse and then in human on the basis of a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase-like catalytic site, with a proline replacing arginine in the consensus (HCX26X2R) sequence (32,33). PTPLA protein shares no sequence homology with the MTM1 protein family (data not shown) but, quite surprisingly, canine cnm-associated histopathological features closely resemble those observed in human and murine XLMTM. Hence, PTPLA protein may be involved in the same PI-dependent functional signaling pathway as MTM1, at least in skeletal muscle. This hypothesis should be addressed by testing the putative PTPLA phosphatase activity and/or investigating functional interactions between PTPLA and MTM1 proteins by analyzing, for example, the subcellular localization of MTM1 in the muscles of affected Labrador or the subcellular localization of PTPLA in the muscles of Mtm1 to / to  mice..

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	63	In the work presented here, we show that the SINE insertion detected within PTPLA exon 2 is associated with various transcriptional features. First, the SINE insertion is flanked by a direct duplication of the insertion site, which is characteristic of the retroposition mechanism of SINEs. As this duplicated sequence contains an AGGT tetranucleotide, the SINE acquired an uncommon intron-like status [5'-splicing donor site (GT) and 3'-splicing acceptor site (AG)] allowing its proper excision. Although it generates complete and normal mature PTPLA transcripts, this mechanism seems to be poorly efficient as only 1% of wt PTPLA transcripts were detected in muscles of affected cnm to / to  Labradors compared with healthy cnm+/ to  dogs. Precise elimination of the SINE observed in vivo was reproduced ex vivo. In addition to this exceptionally fine removal of parasitic sequence, the repeat element insertion has other deleterious consequences on the transcription of the SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele. Indeed, we provide evidence that the splicing machinery recognizes cryptic splice sites within both the SINE and exon 2 sequences, which yields a mature elongated transcript containing a partially exonized SINE sequence. Concomitantly, exon-skipping involving either exon 2 alone or in combination with other exons results in several PTPLA truncated transcripts. Again, this PTPLAalf-associated aberrant exon-skipping could be undoubtedly attributed to the SINE sequence by itself as it was reproduced in ex vivo splicing experiments. Alu insertions have been associated with other diseases (36 to 39,42,47). These insertions were either associated with exonization of repeat element sequences or with specific exon-skipping. Strikingly, the work presented here highlights that these two mutational mechanisms, previously reported as independent defects, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The systematic dichotomy observed between exonization and exon-skipping mechanisms may depend on splicing regulatory elements, either contained by the inserted Alu sequence or located in the genomic vicinity. Alternatively, technical limitations might have prevented the identification of concomittant subtle transcriptional aberrations in previously reported studies. Owing to the transcriptional defects associated with the SINE insertion in PTPLA, it is tempting to speculate that this repeat element contains splicing regulatory motifs that are strong enough to drive both exonization and exon-skipping. Furthermore, SINE-associated exon-skipping previously reported only refer to skipping of a single exon. For example, Alu insertion in exon 22 of human BCRA2 gene induces alternative skipping of this exon, which may play a role in the development of breast cancer (48). Surprisingly, in Labradors affected by centronuclear myopathy, not only the SINE-targeted exon 2 but also exons 3, 4 and 5 are abnormally skipped in some muscular transcripts. Introns 2 and 3 of canine PTPLA are 183 and 76 bp in length, respectively. We may thus assume that the SINE hampers the spliceosome machinery to recognize normal consensus splicing sites by modifying spatial conformation of the transcripts and/or specific interaction of RNA with regulatory proteins. Abnormal skipping of exons 3 and 4 would thus result from their closeness with the SINE. Finally, all but one PTPLA abnormal transcripts bear a disruption of reading frame. Princeps studies in yeast and human have paved the way for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that eliminates transcripts containing premature termination codons (49,50). The reduced total amount (35%) of PTPLA transcripts detected in muscles from cnm to / to  dogs using real-time RT to PCR analyses could therefore result from NMD leading to the degradation of PTPLA abnormal transcripts..

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	65	Deleterious effects of repeat elements have already been reported in dogs. For example, an intronic SINE insertion within the Hypocretin-receptor-2 in Doberman pinschers induces exon-skipping, leading to narcolepsy (51). To date, relatively few canine diseases have been characterized at the genomic level. With the examples of narcolepsy, hemophilia and centronuclear myopathy, diseases associated with insertion of repeat elements seem well represented. The low average divergence of SINEC_Cf repeats in dogs and the high percentage of bimorphic loci with respect to the presence or absence of SINE insertion (6.7 to 11.5% between dogs of different breed) indicate that expansion of SINEs is a recent and still active process (52; Ewen Kirkness, personal communication). The high incidence of disease-associated insertions in dogs may then be explained by the recent expansion of repeat sequences, which represent 31% of the canine genome (52). By comparison, finding 406 gross insertion and duplication mutations in the Human Genetic Mutation Database that contains 44 090 characterized human mutations suggests that Alu insertions, which occur at a lower rate, hardly contribute to 0.09% of human genetic diseases. Besides their deleterious consequences on gene expression, insertions of SINEs in dogs and their observed bimorphism may contribute to interbreed or intrabreed modulation in gene expression accompanying physiological phenotypic diversity (52). The functional effects of PTPLA mutation reported in the present paper disclose a rare example of a single SINE insertion with several modifications of RNA processing, which provides a molecular basis for the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of gene control by mobile elements (reviewed in 53)..

Both A and B orexins, expressed in specific neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area, have been implicated in the regulation of sleep and feeding. In this study, the stimulatory effect of intracerebroventricular administration of the orexins on food intake was compared between young (4-mo-old) and old (25- to 27-mo-old) male Wistar rats. A stainless steel cannula was implanted stereotactically into the left lateral ventricle. After a 7-day recovery period, different doses (0 to 30 nmol) of orexins were injected into the left lateral ventricle without anesthesia. Food and water consumptions were measured at 1, 2, and 4 h after injection. The protein levels of orexin receptors, a specific receptor for orexin-A (OX1R) and a receptor for both orexin-A and -B (OX2R), in the hypothalamus were determined by Western blot analysis and compared between young and old rats. Intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A stimulated food intake in a dose-dependent manner in young rats. However, no effects were observed at any dose in old rats. The protein level of OX1R in the hypothalamus was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats, although the protein level of OX2R was comparable between groups. Results of the present study indicate that the function of the orexin system is diminished in old rats. The decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for orexin-A's lack of stimulation of food intake in old rats..

When administered centrally to rats, these peptides stimulate food consumption dose dependently (18). In addition, the preproorexin mRNA level is upregulated on fasting (18). These findings suggested that the orexin neuropeptide system plays a significant role in feeding behavior, and orexins are therefore categorized as orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) factors. Moreover, we have reported (13) that orexin-A stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion via the vagal efferent nerves and that orexin-A may be an important candidate as a mediator of the cephalic phase of the secretory response to feeding..

The protein level of OX1R was significantly lower in the old rats than in the young. The band intensity of old rats was 45% less than that of young rats. This result indicates that the decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for the lack of an orexin-A stimulatory effect on food intake in old rats. However, we cannot answer the question of why an 50% reduction in the protein level of OX1R would yield a 100% reduction in behavioral response. Because several neural pathways are involved in the orexigenic action of orexins (16), the aging change of these pathways might be implicated..

There is also a report (25) that a site-specific decrease in immunostaining for orexin was observed in the locus coeruleus of old cats. These reports indicate deterioration of the orexin system in old animals. We did not measure the orexin-A content in the brain, so whether or not that content decreased with age remains unknown. However, because orexin-A can bind to both OX1R and OX2R and the specificity of OX1R for orexin-A is high (18), the age-associated change in OX1R could be biologically more important than that in orexin-A.

There is also a report (25) that a site-specific decrease in immunostaining for orexin was observed in the locus coeruleus of old cats. These reports indicate deterioration of the orexin system in old animals. We did not measure the orexin-A content in the brain, so whether or not that content decreased with age remains unknown. However, because orexin-A can bind to both OX1R and OX2R and the specificity of OX1R for orexin-A is high (18), the age-associated change in OX1R could be biologically more important than that in orexin-A. Our observation leads us to propose that the age-associated decline in OX1R may be related to the age-associated decline in appetite and food intake..

The present observation is compatible with the previous studies (2, 8) in that central orexin-B is a less effective stimulant of food intake than orexin-A. The protein level of OX2R was not significantly different between young and old rats. Terao et al. (23) measured mRNA levels of OX1R and OX2R in eight brain regions of 3-, 12-, 18-, and 24-mo-old C57BL/6 mice. They observed a declining trend of the OX2R mRNA level in the hypothalamus, although there is no age-related change in OX1R mRNA expression. These differences might be due to the species difference, although the precise mechanism is unknown..

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	3	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We investigated the effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin-A-induced feeding and prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of the rat brain. Adrenalectomy (ADX) reduced orexin-A-induced feeding over 4 h by about 60%, compared with shams, an effect that was reversed by corticosterone (CORT) replacement. ADX had no effect on prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the LHA in either the morning or the evening; however, message was up-regulated by CORT in the morning but not the evening. An increased number of emulsion grains per cell in the LHA suggests that this is a specific increase in prepro-orexin mRNA and is not due to an increased number of cells expressing message. Prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the LHA were elevated 4 h after injection of lipopolysaccharide, compared with saline-injected controls. Partial but not complete abolition of orexin-A-induced feeding by ADX suggests that orexin-A-induced feeding may be mediated through glucocorticoid-dependent and glucocorticoid-independent pathways. In the morning increased prepro-orexin mRNA after CORT replacement demonstrates that orexin expression is sensitive to increased concentrations of glucocorticoids. However, the lack of effect of ADX on prepro-orexin mRNA levels suggests that endogenous glucocorticoids are not involved in tonic regulation of basal prepro-orexin expression. Overall our data constitute a body of evidence for an integrated relationship between central orexin expression, stress, glucocorticoid manipulation, and feeding patterns in the rat..

However, it is now clear that orexins are also involved in the regulation of sleep, arousal, locomotor activity and neuroendocrine responses (3, 4), and therefore their orexigenic activity may be secondary to other behavioral traits that influence feeding. In behavioral studies, orexins can modulate stress-related behavior such as grooming, and chewing of inedible material (5, 6, 7). Orexin-containing neurones project from the LHA to many CNS areas involved in mediating stress including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the locus coeruleus (8, 9, 10). OX-1 and OX-2 receptors are widely and differentially distributed throughout the CNS including the PVN, suprachiasmatic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, and ARC of the hypothalamus and also the locus coeruleus and hippocampus (11, 12, 13, 14). These areas have individual and synergistic involvement in regulating circadian rhythm and behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors..

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	9	The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the principal pathways mediating neuroendocrine responses to stress. Hypothalamic neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulate the release of the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide ACTH from the anterior pituitary, with consequent release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Corticosterone (CORT), the principal glucocorticoid in rodents, acts through glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and mineralocorticoid receptors within the hippocampus to negatively regulate HPA axis activity (15). Many studies have demonstrated that orexins can influence HPA axis activity. Plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations are elevated in rats after intracerebroventricular (icv) OX-A administration (5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23). This is accompanied by the induction of c-fos mRNA (17) and AVP and CRF mRNAs (20) in the parvocellular subdivision of the PVN. In addition, in vitro studies have revealed release of CRF peptide, but not AVP, from hypothalamic explants (19). OX-B has also been reported to stimulate HPA axis activity (16). Orexin expression in the rat LHA is increased after stressors such as immobilization (23), cold stress (23), or hypoglycemia (24). Reduced secretion of plasma ACTH and cortisol is reported in patients with narcolepsy (25), a condition associated with orexin deficiency. Therefore there is considerable evidence that orexins can modulate HPA axis activity and that orexin expression is responsive to alterations in HPA axis activity..

Therefore, orexins may not exert a direct effect on appetite regulation within the hypothalamus but may act indirectly to stimulate feeding through increased CORT secretion. To test this hypothesis, we designed experiments to investigate the effect of ADX with or without CORT replacement on OX-A-induced feeding to determine whether endogenous CORT is involved in OX-A-induced feeding behavior. We also investigated the effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression in the morning and evening to determine whether orexin expression, which exhibits a diurnal rhythm of expression (28, 29), may be correlated with the diurnal rhythm of HPA axis activity. Finally, we investigated the effects on orexin expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunological stressor that elicits a robust and prolonged activation of the HPA axis (30, 31)..

These images demonstrate that prepro-OX mRNA is expressed in cells of different size. The number of silver grains per cell of individual prepro-OX gene-expressing cells in the emulsion-dipped slides was significantly (P  <  0.001) increased in the LHA of ADX rats receiving CORT replacement, compared with ADX rats (Fig. 6). The amount of orexin expression is remarkably consistent for a given treatment with 125  plus or minus  4 grains/cell in the ADX group, compared with 187  plus or minus  6 grains/cell in the ADX + CORT group. There was no significant difference in the number of cells expressing prepro-OX mRNA (ADX = 61 cells and ADX+CORT = 67 cells counted in the selected fields of view)..

Our observation that central administration of OX-A increases food intake is in agreement with other groups that have demonstrated that OX-A stimulates feeding in the early light phase in intact rats (2, 37, 38). We now demonstrate for the first time that glucocorticoids exert an important influence on OX-A-induced feeding behavior. ADX significantly reduces orexin-A- induced feeding, a phenomenon that is reversible by CORT replacement at physiological concentrations. These data provide evidence that endogenous CORT can exert an important influence on OX-A-induced food intake. However, because ADX does not completely block OX-A-induced feeding but results in about a 60% reduction, this suggests that there is a pathway mediating orexin-induced food intake that is independent of glucocorticoids..

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	55	One recent study has investigated the effect of ADX on OX-A-induced feeding (39). In contrast to our findings, these investigators observed no effect of ADX on OX-A-induced food intake over a 2-h period (39). This may be due to the suboptimal doses of OX-A employed over a dose range 1.5 to 6 nmol, compared with 8 nmol in the present study, the latter dose being considered optimal for OX-A-induced feeding behavior (2). These findings may also be a result of the shorter period of food intake studied (maximum of 2 h, compared with a maximum of 4 h in our study). In the paper by Drazen et al. (39), it seems evident that ADX is associated with decreased food intake at both higher doses of OX-A at the 2-h time point, but the very small increase in food intake in response to OX-A in sham rats does not permit the ADX effect to reach significance. The larger dose of orexin that we used elicited a greater food intake in the sham rats, compared with that observed by Drazen et al. (39), and consequently we were able to observe a significant and reproducible decrease in orexin-induced food intake in ADX rats..

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	59	Our observation that orexin-induced food intake is decreased by about 60% in ADX rats is evidence that a significant component of eating behavior is dependent on endogenous CORT. It is known that CORT can directly stimulate appetite (41), but the indirect effects on appetite of CORT mediated through hypothalamic neuropeptides is not well understood. A number of mechanisms may be invoked to explain the relationship among CORT, OX-A, and food intake. CORT may stimulate endogenous orexin expression through an action at glucocorticoid receptors within the LHA or intermediary nuclei, it may act via orexin peptide release within the PVN/ARC areas of the hypothalamus, or CORT may stimulate food intake itself consequent to orexin activation of HPA axis activity. There is also a possibility that CORT may exert its effect on food intake via other peptides that modulate appetite rather than directly through orexins. There is a well-defined pathway of glucocorticoid feedback on CRF expression in the PVN and release from the median eminence (42). CRF inhibits food intake and therefore increased CORT could increase food intake through its inhibitory action on CRF. Orexin-induced feeding is enhanced by a CRF receptor antagonist, suggesting CRF involvement (43). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is also a possible mediator of orexin-induced feeding. Glucocorticoid manipulation results in a marked similarity between orexin and NPY effects on feeding. ADX reduced NPY-induced food intake by about 60%, similar to the effects of ADX on orexin-induced feeding, and this was reversed by CORT replacement (44). NPY is the most potent known inducer of food intake (45), and orexin-induced feeding can be blocked by a Y1 receptor antagonist (46). Therefore, it is conceivable that orexin exerts its principal glucocorticoid-dependent actions on food intake through NPY, and it is the direct effects of CORT on NPY, not on orexin expression, which explains our observations. However, we have observed a 40% increase in food intake in response to OX-A in ADX rats in the complete absence of CORT, which is strong evidence for a glucocorticoid-independent central pathway of direct orexin-induced food intake that may not be mediated through NPY..

Increased blood CORT may up-regulate orexin expression through the large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LHA (47, 48). Emulsion staining established that there was no significant difference in the number of cells expressing prepro-OX between treatment groups. Therefore, the increases in prepro-OX mRNA that we observed in response to CORT represent increased expression of prepro-OX within cells of the LHA. There was a slight increase in prepro-OX mRNA expression in the sham group in the evening, compared with the morning, although this was not statistically significant. Plasma CORT levels were significantly increased in the evening, compared with the morning, in sham animals in agreement with previous studies demonstrating diurnal variations in HPA axis activity (49). However, it is important to note that CORT levels were similar in both the morning and evening replacement groups and not significantly different from morning levels in the sham animals. It is possible that the increase in evening prepro-OX expression, although not statistically significant, may be a consequence of the circadian increase in endogenous circulating CORT. This increase may be sufficient to mask any further stimulatory effects on orexin expression by exogenous CORT. Further investigations of interrelationships between the circadian cycles of HPA axis activity and orexin expression will undoubtedly shed light on regulatory mechanisms controlling the highly integrated modalities of sleep-wake patterns and feeding behavior..

Our experiment used a 7-d ADX with CORT replacement, compared with previous studies using 5 d ADX with dexamethasone (50) and 10 d ADX with CORT (39). It is instructive to compare these discrepancies with the literature on NPY expression after ADX. Although there is a general consensus that NPY is up-regulated by glucocorticoids, reports differ on the effects on NPY expression of eliminating endogenous cortisosterone by ADX. Short-term ADX (4 d) did not alter NPY peptide levels in the ARC or PVN (51), whereas the same group observed that long-term ADX (12 d) deceased NPY peptide levels in these areas (52). ADX (7 d) had no effect on NPY immunoreactivity in most hypothalamic areas, one notable exception being the PVN (53). A longer-term ADX (12 d) had no effect on prepro-NPY mRNA in the ARC (54); peptide levels were not measured in this study. Either dexamethasone or CORT replacement up-regulated NPY mRNA, but dexamethasone was much more potent (53). Therefore, any effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression, as with NPY, may be dependent on the period of ADX, the concentration and type of glucocorticoid, whether orexin peptide or mRNA is measured, and how specifically defined is the hypothalamic site selected for analysis..

This suggests that there may a hypothalamic mechanism involving orexin as an analgesic agent during neurogenic pain. It is also possible that, after onset of inflammation in which the acute phase response to LPS plays a crucial role, it is so important to maintain homeostatic control of the peripheral release of inflammatory cytokines through increased secretion of CORT that an immunological stimulus will activate all hypothalamic components that drive HPA axis activity, including orexins..

SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   Both obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are complex disorders with multiple risk factors, which interact in a complicated fashion to determine the overall phenotype. In addition to environmental risk factors, each disorder has a strong genetic basis that is likely due to the summation of small to moderate effects from a large number of genetic loci. Obesity is a strong risk factor for sleep apnea, and there are some data to suggest sleep apnea may influence obesity. It is therefore not surprising that many susceptibility genes for obesity and OSA should be shared. Current research suggests that approximately half of the genetic variance in the apnea hypopnea index is shared with obesity phenotypes. Genetic polymorphisms that increase weight will also be risk factors for apnea. In addition, given the interrelated pathways regulating both weight and other intermediate phenotypes for sleep apnea such as ventilatory control, upper airway muscle function, and sleep characteristics, it is likely that there are genes with pleiotropic effects independently impacting obesity and OSA traits. Other genetic loci likely interact with obesity to influence development of OSA in a gene-by-environment type of effect. Conversely, environmental stressors such as intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation produced by OSA may interact with obesity susceptibility genes to modulate the importance that these loci have on defining obesity-related traits..

Obesity in modern Western society is also extremely common. As of 2002, nearly one-third of US adults met clinical criteria for obesity, and this prevalence appears to only be increasing (27)..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	6	That obesity and OSA often colocalize is of no surprise. Other than perhaps male gender, obesity is the strongest risk factor for the development of OSA. Relative to those with a stable weight, a 10% increase in weight over 4 yr is associated with a sixfold increase in the risk of developing moderate to severe OSA (58). Weight loss trials have found significant reductions in apnea severity with moderate weight loss (69, 74). However, the mechanisms by which obesity causes OSA are not completely defined, with many potential pathways hypothesized (93). Perhaps the most obvious is that fat deposition in the neck and airway lumen may lead to increased collapsibility of the upper airway. In addition, adiposity in the chest and abdomen may result in reductions in lung volumes. Recent studies suggest reduced lung volume may independently predispose to upper airway collapse (37). Another possible mechanism relating obesity with sleep apnea is via the hormonal effects of adipose tissue. Leptin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, has important effects on weight regulation by stimulating hypothalamic satiety centers (6, 34, 57). Human obesity is typically associated with elevated leptin levels, suggesting a state of leptin resistance (15). Besides regulating weight, leptin may have important effects on ventilatory drive. Leptin-deficient mice hypoventilate and have a blunted response to hypercapnia (53, 84). Administration of leptin corrects these abnormalities independent of changes in weight (53). Through these effects on ventilatory control, elevated leptin levels (or the underlying leptin-resistant state) may play a pathogenic role in the development of OSA..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	8	It is also possible that OSA may play a causal role in the development of obesity. OSA patients have elevated leptin levels compared with weight-matched controls, and OSA treatment lowers these levels (39, 53, 55). These findings suggest OSA may be a cause of leptin resistance and thus a propensity for further weight gain. Not only does sleep disruption, a common result of OSA, reduce serum leptin levels, it also increases levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin (76, 82). These findings were associated with increases in hunger and appetite scores (76). Epidemiological studies consistently implicate reduced sleep as a risk factor for the development of obesity (36, 47, 70, 82, 87, 89). Although overall weight does not appear to fall with treatment of OSA, one study did find the amount of fat inside the abdominal cavity (visceral fat) diminishes (10). This fat compartment appears to have unique hormonal effects as the amount of visceral adipose tissue is more strongly associated with metabolic complications of obesity such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than measures of subcutaneous fat or overall obesity (28, 29)..

SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   That obesity is in large part genetically determined has been known for almost three decades (26). A large twin study estimated the heritability of weight to be 78% (79). That is to say, 78% of the variability in weight across a population is explained by shared intrafamilial factors. Subsequent studies demonstrated that adopted children have a body size more closely resembling their biological parents than their adopted parents (80). Studies in Finland and the United Kingdom have estimated the heritability of body mass index (BMI) to be 60 to 80% (42, 61). Linkage to obesity-related phenotypes has been investigated in some 50 genomewide scans to date with dozens of candidate loci and genes identified (3, 59)..
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	11	Similarly, familial factors have been known to influence OSA risk for nearly 25 years (77). Since then, several groups have quantified the familial risk of OSA by studying widely different populations. All of these studies have identified a strong heritable component to OSA (30, 32, 49, 62, 66). Family-based studies suggest that the risk of OSA is approximately twice as great among relatives of apneic persons (30, 66). In addition, a dose-response relationship exists such that the risk of OSA increases with increasing number of apneic relatives (66). Quantitative apnea-related phenotypes also demonstrate substantial heritability. A study of elderly twins found the heritability of both the respiratory disturbance index and the oxygen desaturation index to be nearly 40% (7)..

SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   Given the strong genetic components to both obesity and apnea phenotypes as well as the tight association with multiple interweaving links between these two diseases, it would not be surprising for there to exist common susceptibility genes for both obesity and OSA. In fact, it has been suggested that the familial aggregation of OSA may simply be a reflection of that found in obesity. This is clearly not the case. Even after controlling for BMI, significant familial aggregation for OSA persists (32, 66). Furthermore, a study of nonobese apneic patients also demonstrated strong heritability of OSA (49). That this should be the case should be of no surprise given that other pathophysiological pathways to apnea development such as craniofacial structure and ventilatory control have also been demonstrated to have a heritable component (13, 32, 49, 63, 65). Thus the susceptibility genes for OSA are not exclusively the same genes as those modulating obesity. That does not mean, however, that no overlap exists..
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	14	Clearly, given the strong effect of obesity on OSA pathogenesis, any genetic variant that predisposes to obesity will secondarily also lead to the development of OSA. Thus any obesity gene might also be considered to be an apnea gene. However, obesity is not a monolithic process. Clearly, there are some forms of obesity that have a more important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. For example, fat deposition in the neck is much more important than fat deposition in the limbs (17). An android fat deposition pattern (excess subcutaneous truncal-abdominal fat) and visceral adiposity have also been found to more closely predict OSA than overall obesity (31, 72). Therefore genetic polymorphisms that influence fat deposition in these sites will be more important OSA genes. There is a wealth of evidence that these fat distribution pattern phenotypes are genetically driven. Large differences in the patterns of fat deposition exist across inbred strains of cattle, suggesting an important role for genetics (83). Among humans, even after correction for overall obesity, measures of fat deposition pattern aggregate within families. The ratio of subscapular skinfold thickness to subscapular plus suprailiac thicknesses, a measure of the android fat pattern, has been reported to have a heritability of 43% (71). Measures of central obesity such as BMI-adjusted waist circumference and ratio of trunk to extremity skinfold ratio have heritabilities of 29 to 48% (40). These findings strongly support the hypothesis that there are genetic polymorphisms that specifically promote fat deposition in the subcutaneous regions of the torso or around the abdominal viscera. Through this mechanism, these variants would promote the development of both obesity and OSA..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	16	Another type of potential genetic interaction between obesity and OSA is one in which a particular polymorphism leads to both obesity and OSA through independent mechanisms (Fig. 1). For example, by impacting leptin function, a genetic polymorphism may reduce satiety and also increase ventilatory instability. This is what is referred to as genetic pleiotropy. Pleiotropic genetic effects have clearly been described in other situations. A well known example is at the APOE locus, which codes for apolipoprotein E. The 4 allele of APOE is an important risk factor for both atherosclerotic heart disease as well as Alzheimer s dementia (24, 91). The circadian regulatory gene, CLOCK, also appears to influence multiple biological systems. CLOCK-knockout mice have profound disruptions in circadian rhythmicity, and so it is not surprising that these animals would have abnormal timings for feeding and activity (88). In addition, however, these mutant animals demonstrate an overall increase in caloric intake associated with a phenotype of obesity and metabolic syndrome (85). Similarly, given the large number of neurological, metabolic, and mechanical overlaps between obesity and OSA, it is likely that a polymorphism affecting one biochemical system may affect the risk for both disorders via multiple paths. For example, disruptions of the orexin system could potentially result in a common link between obesity and OSA. Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus play an important role in sustaining wakefulness with projections to all of the wake-promoting areas of the brain (21). Loss of these neurons is associated with a narcolepsy phenotype (60). These neurons, as the name orexin implies, also play an important role in stimulating appetite, projecting on to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (68). Thus mutations affecting orexin, the orexin receptor, or proteins involved in the downstream signaling of orexin binding might simultaneously affect metabolic and sleep-related function. Several other potential candidate genes are listed in Table 1..

Some susceptibility genes act directly on one phenotype and through the causal relationships between obesity and sleep apnea have indirect effects on the other.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	19	  The recently reported linkage scans from the Cleveland Family Study represent the first genomewide linkage studies of OSA phenotypes (54, 55). The results provide insight into possible genetic overlaps between obesity and OSA. Linkage to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as a measure of OSA and BMI as a measure of obesity was tested across the autosomal chromosomes in both a Caucasian and an African-American cohort. The heritability of AHI in both groups was 33%, whereas the heritability of BMI was over 50%. After controlling for BMI, significant heritability for AHI remained, supporting the notion that the genetic susceptibility to OSA is not completely defined by weight. In further multivariate modeling of a larger subset of the Cleveland Family Study, obesity measures such as BMI and serum leptin explained 50 to 55% of the genetic variance in AHI (56). This suggests that about half of the genetic determinants of AHI are obesity related and half are obesity independent..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	21	Linkage findings are described by the logarithmic odds (LOD) score, a measure of the odds ratio of linkage to no linkage. Although none of the linkage findings in either racial group achieved genomewide significance (LOD  >  3.3) (46), there were several regions with intermediate LOD scores, indicative of possible linkage in the setting of complex, multifactorial diseases such as obesity and OSA (90). Furthermore, the change in linkage evidence for AHI after adjustment for BMI provides insight into mechanisms of action if a susceptibility locus is present. Among the Caucasians, a LOD score of 1.4 was found for AHI and 1.7 for BMI on chromosome 12p (54). After adjustment for BMI, the maximal LOD for AHI in this region dropped to only 0.4 whereas the LOD for BMI adjusted for AHI fell to 0.2. These data suggest that if a susceptibility gene for AHI exists in this region, it likely mediates its effect on apnea via obesity. On the other hand, a maximal LOD for AHI of 1.4 was found on 19q with no linkage evidence for BMI in this region (54). Adjustment for BMI had no effect on the AHI LOD, suggesting that a susceptibility gene in this region exerts its effect on AHI through obesity-independent mechanisms..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	23	A different pattern of linkage findings was found at the short arm of chromosome 2. Among the Caucasians, the maximal LOD for AHI is 1.6 and for BMI is 3.1 in this region, again suggesting that a susceptibility locus for both phenotypes might exist in this region (54). However, adjustment for BMI only dropped the LOD for AHI to 1.3, suggesting that the obesity effect at this locus does not fully explain the apnea effect. This may represent two independent loci, one influencing AHI and one BMI. Another possibility is that there is only one locus at 2p regulating both AHI and BMI but via independent mechanisms. A strong candidate gene for both phenotypes in this region is proopiomelanocortin (POMC). The POMC locus, found at 2p23.3, encodes for a number of hormones including melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are important in energy homeostasis via MSH. Leptin s anorexic activity is mediated via depolarization of these neurons, and use of an MSH agonist decreases both body fat and leptin levels in humans (16, 25). Obesity phenotypes have been consistently linked to the POMC locus (14, 33, 38, 67), haplotypes in this gene have been associated with leptin levels (38, 50), and severe mutations in this gene produce a severe childhood obesity phenotype (44). Leptin s effects on ventilatory drive in mouse models are also mediated via MSH, suggesting that this pathway may independently predispose to apnea as well (64)..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	25	Evidence for pleiotropy also exists at chromosome 8q. Among African-Americans in the Cleveland Family Study, the peak LOD scores were 1.3 and 1.6 for AHI and BMI, respectively (55). Again, after controlling for BMI, the AHI LOD only dropped to 1.1, suggesting that the obesity and apnea promoting effects in this region were independent. A potential candidate locus in this region is the COH1 gene at 8q22 to 23. This gene encodes a transmembrane protein with a presumed role in vesicle-mediated sorting and intracellular protein transport on the basis of its structure (43). Severe mutations in this gene have been associated with Cohen syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by truncal obesity (9). Other findings include facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and ocular anomalies. The craniofacial abnormalities include microcephaly, facial hypotonia, and laryngomalacia, all of which could predispose to OSA. Thus mutations in this gene that are milder but more common may play a role, via separate pathways, in contributing to nonsyndromic forms of both obesity and OSA..

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	27	The serotoninergic system is another common pathway that could link obesity and OSA. Serotonin has important effects on the stimulation of satiety centers in the arcuate nucleus (5). In addition, serotonin potentiates hypoglossal neural output, which increases upper airway dilator muscle activity (45, 75). Thus reductions in serotoninergic activity, by increasing appetite, could promote obesity and, by lowering muscle tone in the upper airway, could promote OSA. Both linkage and haplotype association studies in a Finnish population suggest a serotonin-related gene at Xq24 is associated with obesity (51, 81). The SLC6A14 gene encodes for a sodium chloride-dependent transporter of neutral and cationic amino acids, which appears to play an important role in the transport of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, into the central nervous system (73). A French study has confirmed the association of this polymorphism with obesity, and an association with hunger and satiety scores was also found (19). Whether this polymorphism is associated with OSA (via or independent of any obesity effects) has not yet been studied, as the OSA linkage scans reported thus far have not included the sex chromosomes..

SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   Another potential method of genetic interaction between obesity and OSA is a form of gene-by-environment effect where the adverse effects of obesity or OSA can be thought of as environmental stressors (Fig. 2). Each of the methods by which obesity predisposes to OSA can be influenced by an individual s underlying genetic susceptibility. An increase in fat deposition around the upper airway will be more likely to produce apnea in individuals with a lower ability to respond to this stressor due to reduced upper airway dilator muscle tone. Conversely, obesogenic effects of OSA may be influenced by the underlying genetic milieu. Genetic polymorphisms may modulate the effect that exposure to sleep fragmentation from OSA has on leptin and ghrelin dynamics. Other polymorphisms might influence the effect that these hormonal perturbations have on producing further weight gain..

Sleep apnea susceptibility genes may interact with obesity through numerous mechanisms to influence sleep apnea predisposition. Genetic polymorphisms may modulate the degree to which obesity alters ventilatory drive, reduces lung volume, or narrows the upper airway. Other polymorphisms may affect the degree to which these stresses result in the development of sleep apnea. Similarly, obesity susceptibility genes may interact with sleep apnea in its potential effect on obesity..
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	31	  The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPARG) gene located on chromosome 3p25 encodes a protein that is a key component of a nuclear transcription factor important in adipocyte differentiation (4). Variants in this gene have been implicated as risk factors for the development of obesity (4, 18, 20, 48, 86). Because hypoxia is known to suppress PPARG gene transcription (94, 95), the importance of a mild defect in PPARG function may become magnified in the setting of recurrent exposure to hypoxia from OSA. Thus PPARG allelic variants may play a much more important role in determining obesity phenotypes in individuals with OSA, and OSA may play a much more important role in promoting weight gain among those with a mutation in PPARG..

These genes encode for uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial proton channels that divert energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis (2). In so doing, their activation increases energy consumption. Polymorphisms in both genes have been associated with obesity phenotypes (8, 12, 22 to 23, 52). Interestingly, sleep deprivation in rodent models has been shown to increase expression of both UCP1 and UCP2 (11, 41), suggesting the sleep disruption of OSA may influence expression of these genes and thus the relative importance of a variant at these loci in determining obesity risk..

SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   There appear to be multiple causal pathways linking obesity with sleep apnea. Although obesity is clearly a strong risk factor for OSA, further research is needed to better define any potential risk OSA carries for promoting weight gain. Both diseases also clearly have a strong genetic basis. Although work has begun to identify the specific genetic polymorphisms that confer risk to the development of these disorders, clearly much more needs to be accomplished in this arena. A recent workshop sponsored by the American Thoracic Society laid out recommendations for future research aimed at dissecting the genetic bases for sleep-disordered breathing (78). A chief objective was the development of novel phenotypes, including biomarkers, that more closely reflect only one or a few molecular pathways rather than the overarching syndrome defined with the AHI. These simpler phenotypes could be more amenable to genetic analysis because of the fewer sources of variance than a global measure of apnea. The same holds true for obesity research, where the use of more specific phenotypes of fat deposition patterns would provide not only better insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity but also a better understanding of how obesity and OSA interrelate..

A better understanding of the neurobiology and molecular pathways underlying obesity and sleep apnea will also allow for a more rational selection of candidate genes to test for association with these disorders. Ultimately, the use of gene-knockout animal models will be important to establish causality of any identified associations. In performing these genetic studies, it will be important to simultaneously consider both disorders given their close relationship. Methodology for conducting bivariate linkage scans has already been developed, and there is evidence to suggest that such a strategy is more powerful than traditional univariate approaches (1). Not only will many genetic variants influence the development of OSA by causing obesity or vice versa but it is likely that there are also variants with pleiotropic effects predisposing to obesity and OSA via independent mechanisms. Identifying such genes and understanding their function will provide novel insights into the shared pathogenesis of these diseases. Finally, the possibility that genetic polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility that each disease confers toward the other should not be ignored. Incorporating such a model of gene x environment interaction into future study designs along with an understanding of the effects of obesity on OSA can allow for a better delineation of OSA susceptibility genes and vice versa. Similarly, use of such a model along with information about the genetics of obesity would allow for a more complete understanding of how OSA may impact obesity..

Given that orexins are involved in regulating food intake and activating the HPA axis, we hypothesized that food deprivation, an acute challenge to the systems that regulate energy balance, should elicit changes in orexin receptor signaling at the hypothalamic and adrenal levels. Food deprivation induced orexin type 1 (OX1R) and 2 (OX2R) receptors at mRNA and protein levels in the hypothalamus, in addition to a fivefold increase in prepro-orexin mRNA. Cleaved peptides OR-A and OR-B are also elevated at the protein level. Interestingly, adrenal OX1R and OX2R levels were significantly reduced in food-deprived animals, whereas there was no expression of prepro-orexin in the adrenal gland in either state. Food deprivation exerted a differential effect on OXR-G protein coupling. In the hypothalamus of food deprived rats compared with controls, a significant increase in coupling of orexin receptors to Gq, Gs, and Go was demonstrated, whereas coupling to Gi was relatively less. However, in the adrenal cortex of the food-deprived animal, there was decreased coupling of orexin receptors to Gs, Go, and Gq and increased coupling to Gi. Subsequent second-messenger studies (cAMP/IP3) have supported these findings. Our data indicate that food deprivation has differential effects on orexin receptor expression and their signaling characteristics at the hypothalamic and adrenocortical levels. These findings suggest orexins as potential metabolic regulators within the HPA axis both centrally and peripherally..

Studies in rodents have shown that food deprivation induces marked ACTH and corticosterone responses, implicating feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (2, 3). Besides nutritional states and neuropeptides, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and neuropeptide Y (NPY), known to regulate both the HPA system and feeding behavior, several "signals" are known to regulate the HPA system. Hypoglycemia is a potent activator of the HPA axis, reflecting the strong functional relationship between the hypothalamic feeding centers and the HPA axis (4), and leptin, whose concentrations are governed by nutritional status, has an inhibitory effect on plasma corticosterone in rats (5)..

Both OR-A (a 33-residue peptide) and OR-B (a 28-residue peptide) are proteolytically cleaved from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, and share a 46% amino acid sequence homology. Besides playing a role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis, orexins have been reported to exert divergent physiological actions (8 to 12). Orexins orchestrate their actions by binding and activating two types of G protein-coupled receptors, orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptor (OX2R), which display 64% homology in their amino acid sequence (6). The OX1R preferentially binds OR-A, whereas OX2R binds both OR-A and OR-B, apparently with similar affinity (6)..

Fasting (6) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia (13, 14) increase prepro-orexin mRNA in the rat lateral hypothalamic area, whereas leptin has the converse effect (15). Interestingly, fasting and leptin also regulate the hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16). These findings, and the observation that intracerebroventricular administration of OR-A or OR-B stimulates food consumption in rats (6), suggests a physiological role for these neuropeptides as mediators in the regulation of feeding, particularly in response to energy deprivation..

For example, studies in food-deprived rats have suggested that the HPA axis is integral to a larger hypothalamic system that mediates energy flow (2) and that, in these animals, catabolic activity quickly predominates, reinforced by elevated corticosterone not driven by hypothalamic control (ACTH), implicating adrenal activity as a metabolic regulator (3). In addition to their hypothalamic effects, "nutritional signals" such as leptin and NPY have a direct action at the adrenal level, via their receptors, including the modulation of corticosteroid secretion (17, 18). Of interest, rat adrenals express both orexin receptors (19), and orexins stimulate corticosterone secretion of rat adrenocortical cells through the activation of the adenylyl cyclase-dependent signaling cascade (20)..

Interestingly, in the food-deprived animal, OR-A decreased the coupling of orexin receptors to Gs and Go and increased that of Gi, whereas there was no coupling toward Gq (Fig. 5A). Quantification of the immunocomplexes is shown in Fig. 5C..

When hypothalamic membranes from fed rats were incubated with OR-A (10 pM to 100 nM) for 30 min at 25 degrees C, there was a significant increase in cAMP production. This increase was found to be dose dependent, whereas the maximal response (55  plus or minus  5% of basal) was observed at a concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 6A). The response was amplified in the food-deprived rat, where 100 nM treatment induced a cAMP response of 95  plus or minus  5% of basal (Fig. 6A)..

This OR-A effect has a threshold of 1 nM and a maximum response at 100 nM (30  plus or minus  4% of basal; Fig. 6B). Consistent with our G protein labeling studies, there was a significant (P  <  0.01) increase in IP3 production from hypothalami of the food-deprived rats compared with controls (70  plus or minus  7% of basal; Fig. 6B)..

Similarly, when rat adrenocortical membranes from fed rats were incubated with OR-A (0.01 nM to 100 nM), there was a significant increase in cAMP and IP3 production (Fig. 6, C and D). These increases appeared to be dose dependent, with a maximum response at 100 nM for cAMP (78  plus or minus  8% of basal) and at 10 nM for IP3 (50  plus or minus  7% of basal). However, in the food-deprived animals compared with controls, treatment of adrenocortical membranes with OR-A induced a modest response toward cAMP production that was significant only at 100 nM, with no apparent effect toward IP3 turnover (Fig. 6, C and D). Again, these findings were in keeping with our photoaffinity labeling experiments..

A similar role for the adrenal gland is possible given that it expresses receptors for leptin, NPY (28), and orexin (19, 29), all regulators of energy homeostasis. In agreement with previous studies (6, 15), we were able to show that the levels of prepro-orexin mRNA are influenced by nutritional status, being upregulated upon fasting in the hypothalamus. Detailed analysis at the protein level confirmed that both cleaved bioactive peptides (OR-A and OR-B) are upregulated under food deprivation. Previous studies in fasted lactating rats demonstrated hypothalamic OR-B levels to be raised 10-fold above those for controls (nonfasted), whereas OR-A showed no change (30). These differences can be due to the rodent strain used, the sex, metabolic status, and the duration of food deprivation..

These findings are of interest given that orexins stimulate the HPA axis when administered centrally (31). Furthermore, orexin neurons are sensitive to nutritional signals such as insulin and glucose, which alter with food deprivation (3), and hypothalamic orexin neurons express leptin receptors. As with prepro-orexin expression, fasting and leptin also regulate hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16, 32)..

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	89	Numerous studies have mapped in detail the expression of orexin and orexin receptors at the hypothalamic level. Trivedi et al. (33) have demonstrated that, within the hypothalamus, OX1R mRNA is most abundant in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, whereas OX2R is predominantly expressed in the paraventricular nucleus. In another study, it has been shown that, after 20 h of fasting, levels of rat OX1R mRNA were significantly increased in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the medial division of amygdala, whereas levels of OX2R mRNA were augmented in the arcuate nucleus but remained unchanged in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and amygdala following fasting (16). Three different studies (34, 13, 15) indicated that prepro-orexin is upregulated in the hypothalamus upon food deprivation in the lateral hypothalamic area of the rat. In agreement with these studies, we noted that, on fasting, hypothalamic OX1R and OX2R gene expression was induced. Given the detailed analysis these studies provided, we shifted our interest to the expression at the protein level. Here, we provide new evidence that these changes are also mirrored at the protein level, as it was assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting analysis..

These observations are of interest given that orexins have circadian-dependent actions and that orexins are known to increase corticosterone production in rats (20) and cortisol in human adrenocortical cells (36). However, in view of our data, we can conclude that adrenal orexin receptors do not influence or mediate the rise in corticosterone levels seen under food deprivation conditions..

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	92	It is well documented that food deprivation induces multiple metabolic changes that may directly influence orexin receptor expression in the adrenal gland. For example, there is a negative correlation between testosterone levels and fasting (37). Studies from our laboratory have shown that testosterone levels also decrease following 24 h of food deprivation (unpublished observations). Interestingly, in gonadectomized rats, there was a significant downregulation of adrenal OX2R, an effect that was reversed upon testosterone replacement (38). Although the regulation of adrenal orexin receptors by gonadal steroids is not directly relevant to our findings, it suggests that changes in orexin receptor expression may be a secondary phenomenon following initial food deprivation-induced alterations..

Orexins act through two distinct G protein-coupled receptors, which can transduce intracellular signals by activating heterotrimeric G proteins. It is likely that multiple second messenger systems are involved, as orexins have been shown to increase intracellular calcium influx (6, 39, 40, 41). There is also the suggestion that OX2R is coupled to the inhibitory Gi protein (42). We have shown for the first time that native orexin receptors in the hypothalamus can activate four types of G proteins, namely Gs, Gq, Go, and Gi, in response to OR-A. Although Gi and Go are the two major inhibitory signaling pathways in the rat brain, we have previously shown that multiple subtypes of G proteins couple to other G protein-coupled receptor systems (43). Food deprivation altered the G protein coupling profile. Our findings are supported by functional assays of cAMP and IP3 assays, reflecting their G protein coupling status. Further research is needed to investigate whether the -subunits are implicated in activating second messengers and also to assess the effects of OR-B on G protein signaling..

0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	1	Modern anaesthetics are, in the main, safe and predictable in their use, and highly efficient. Moreover, it could be argued that without these properties major advances in surgical practice, so often highlighted in the media, could not have taken place. However, as an example of pharmacology, the production of the anaesthetic state remains somewhat of a mystery. This mystery results from the controversies related to the existence of a unitary anaesthetic target site. From direct observation of clinical anaesthesia, this seems unlikely as different anaesthetic agents produce different  types  of anaesthesia. GABAA receptors have long been held as a unifying cellular target (with some exceptions), but others have also been suggested. In this editorial, we consider the evidence in support of a role for noradrenergic transmission as a  wiring  target for anaesthetic action. The clear role of this system in analgesia is not considered..

What is the role of noradrenergic neurones in this area? Most of the previous studies6 suggest that norepinephrine neurones in the preoptic area may contribute to wakefulness, as direct activation or injection of norepinephrine into this area inhibits sleep. However, several studies also suggest that some norepinephrine neurones may be involved in the induction of sleep.7 8 Mohan Kumar and colleagues7 reported that microinjection of norepinephrine into the medial preoptic area after destruction of the ventral noradrenergic bundle induced sleep. This group also reported that there was a mild reduction in sleep and an increase in wakefulness after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine.8 Thus, it appears that noradrenergic fibres in the medial preoptic area may be hypnogenic..

It has been reported that the 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, given orally, increased active waking and slow wave sleep and decreased paradoxical sleep in the rat.9 In contrast, 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with systemic methoxamine, increased aroused wakefulness and decreased slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep in cats.10 In addition, prazosin increased but the 1-agonist ST 587 decreased the duration of thiopental anaesthesia in rats.11 Matsumoto and colleagues also reported that direct intracerebroventricular administration of methoxamine dose-dependently reduced pentobarbital anaesthesia time in mice.12 Most of the central physiological effects of 2-agonists can be attributed to 2-adrenoceptors present in the locus coeruleus.13 In rats, microinjection of the 2-agonist dexmedetomedine into the locus coeruleus per se produces anaesthesia (defined as a loss of righting reflex).14 2-Agonists also reduce anaesthetic requirement in human and many other species.15 In contrast to these data, the 2-antagonist yohimbine decreases sleep,16 and anaesthesia time15 in a variety of non-human species..

However, they failed to show an effect with the selective ss1-antagonists metoprolol and atenolol.11 17 They also studied the role of ss2-adrenoceptors in sleep and general anaesthesia,11 16 17 and found that the selective ss2-antagonist ICI 118551 increased sleep time16 and the duration of thiopental anaesthesia.17 Collectively, these data indicate that the effects of the non-selective antagonist, propranolol, may be mediated via ss2-adrenoceptors..

Orexins and their receptors are widely distributed in the brain.18 Orexins activate the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system and this activation may increase arousal and locomotor activity.19 In addition, several reports20 suggest a link between orexin receptors and narcolepsy. Therefore, modulation of noradrenergic neurones by orexins and their receptors may contribute to control of the sleep to wake cycle. Moreover, we suggest that these neuropeptides and their receptors may also be involved in general anaesthesia, although this remains to be examined..

0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	15	Based on these considerations, we and others have began a systematic evaluation of a range of anaesthetic agents on central norepinephrine release using in vivo microdialysis techniques. Mizuno and colleagues reported that intraperitoneal pentobarbital inhibited norepinephrine release from the medial preoptic area in rats.4 In addition, we have shown that systemic administration of midazolam and propofol significantly reduced norepinephrine release from the medial prefrontal cortex,21 but pentobarbital was ineffective.22 As noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex receive innervation from the locus coeruleus,3 the activity of noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex indirectly reflects locus coeruleus activity. Thus, anaesthetics that activate or enhance GABAA receptors may reduce noradrenergic neuronal activity. In contrast, ketamine,21 22 nitrous oxide and xenon,23 which have NMDA receptor antagonistic actions, markedly increased norepinephrine release from the prefrontal cortex and preoptic area in rats. Clearly, anaesthetic modulation of norepinephrine release depends on the type of anaesthetic. This might argue against noradrenergic transmission as an anaesthetic target. However, as we have already mentioned, a unitary site is highly unlikely. Loss of consciousness results not only from a reduction in cerebral activity, but also as a result of cerebral excitation such as occurs during convulsions. In addition, sleepiness is induced by not only hypothermia but also by increased body temperature that activates heat-sensitive neurones in the preoptic area.24 We feel that wakefulness may occur over a set range and that when this range is exceeded (above or below), unconsciousness may occur. In support of this hypothesis we found that physostigmine, which has been reported to antagonize ketamine anaesthesia, reduced both the duration of ketamine anaesthesia and ketamine-increased norepinephrine release from the rat prefrontal cortex.25.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	16	Based on these considerations, we and others have began a systematic evaluation of a range of anaesthetic agents on central norepinephrine release using in vivo microdialysis techniques. Mizuno and colleagues reported that intraperitoneal pentobarbital inhibited norepinephrine release from the medial preoptic area in rats.4 In addition, we have shown that systemic administration of midazolam and propofol significantly reduced norepinephrine release from the medial prefrontal cortex,21 but pentobarbital was ineffective.22 As noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex receive innervation from the locus coeruleus,3 the activity of noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex indirectly reflects locus coeruleus activity. Thus, anaesthetics that activate or enhance GABAA receptors may reduce noradrenergic neuronal activity. In contrast, ketamine,21 22 nitrous oxide and xenon,23 which have NMDA receptor antagonistic actions, markedly increased norepinephrine release from the prefrontal cortex and preoptic area in rats. Clearly, anaesthetic modulation of norepinephrine release depends on the type of anaesthetic. This might argue against noradrenergic transmission as an anaesthetic target. However, as we have already mentioned, a unitary site is highly unlikely. Loss of consciousness results not only from a reduction in cerebral activity, but also as a result of cerebral excitation such as occurs during convulsions. In addition, sleepiness is induced by not only hypothermia but also by increased body temperature that activates heat-sensitive neurones in the preoptic area.24 We feel that wakefulness may occur over a set range and that when this range is exceeded (above or below), unconsciousness may occur. In support of this hypothesis we found that physostigmine, which has been reported to antagonize ketamine anaesthesia, reduced both the duration of ketamine anaesthesia and ketamine-increased norepinephrine release from the rat prefrontal cortex.25.

We found orexin-containing fibers within the pre-Botzinger complex. However, only 0.5% of orexin-containing neurons projected to the pre-Botzinger region, whereas 2.9% of orexin-containing neurons innervated the phrenic nucleus. Neurons of the pre-Botzinger region and phrenic nucleus stained for orexin receptors, and activation of orexin receptors by microperfusion of orexin in either site produced a dose-dependent, significant (P  <  0.05) increase in diaphragm electromyographic activity.

Control experiments for each experiment were done to determine whether the primary or the secondary antibodies produced false-positive results. In these experiments, sections were stained with all possible combinations of primary and secondary antibodies in which a single immunoprobe was omitted. Omission of primary or secondary antibodies resulted in the absence of labeling, demonstrating that no false-positive results were obtained with these reagents. Slides were viewed with a bright-field and fluorescence microscope (Olympus AX70, Olympus America) equipped with the adequate filter systems to observe the Texas red and green FITC fluorescence. Colocalization of CTB and orexin-1 receptors was identified by alternating between filters to view Texas red and FITC fluorescence and by analyzing merged images of the exact same sites. In this qualitative approach to the problem, we did not attempt to quantitatively estimate total numbers of identifiable phrenic motor neurons between C3 and C5 or the percentage of phrenic motor neurons that stained positively for orexin receptors..

These coordinates were used in previous studies in our laboratory to examine respiration-regulating neurons possessing neurokinin-1 receptors within the so-called pre-Botzinger complex region (26, 42). These same coordinates were later utilized for microinjection of either orexin or toluidine blue marker dye (see below). Histological inspection of sections confirmed that this injection site was caudal to the facial nuclei, rostral to the level of the hypoglossal nuclei, and within the anatomic borders of the pre-Botzinger complex (see also Fig. 2). Seven days after injection, animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused as described above, and the brains were removed and processed immunohistochemically for CTB and orexin labeling. Transverse sections of the whole brain of each animal were cut at 40  microm. The immunohistochemical procedures used were previously described (26) for staining tissue sections of the hypothalamus. Briefly, free-floating sections were washed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and then a 1-in-5 series of tissue sections was exposed for 30 min to a PBS-Triton solution containing 1% BSA to block nonspecific binding sites. After a further wash, the tissue was placed overnight at 4 degrees C in a primary polyclonal antibody solution (1:2,000 dilution of rabbit anti-orexin A in 1% normal goat serum in PBS-Triton; Oncogene Research Products) for 48 h at 4 degrees C. The sections were washed twice in PBS, and they were incubated for 2 h in a solution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). The sections then were washed with PBS and incubated for 60 min in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, as recommended by the supplier..

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	64	Conceivably, the apparent projection of a subset of lateral hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons to pre-Botzinger neurons and to phrenic nuclei could be partly due to nonspecific labeling produced by some diffusion of retrograde tracer into the regions that contain nonrespiratory-related cells, and/or the uptake of tracer by descending fibers of orexin neurons that innervate the intermediate cell column or the thoracolumbar portion of the spinal cord (24). In addition, CTB may also be taken up by fibers of passage. However, CTB continues to be regarded as a useful retrograde tracer in even the most recent neuroanatomic studies (11).

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	66	Considerable numbers of orexin containing fibers were present within the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat. This finding is in accordance with recent data that orexin-containing neurons innervate vagal preganglionic cells within the nucleus ambiguus (12). However, we found little retrograde transport of CTB infused into this area to hypothalamic orexin-ir neurons, and CTB-labeled cells were mostly located medial to orexin-ir neurons. Because CTB is taken up by synaptic vesicles, the possibility exists that synapses between pre-Botzinger complex neurons and orexinergic fibers of passage may be sparse. It may be that orexin released from passing fibers nonsynaptically activates receptors or that orexin circulating within cerebrospinal fluid may activate neurons that contain orexin receptors (volume transmission), in analogy with the effects of endogenously released catecholamines in this region (2, 23). Medullary neurons ventral to the compact portion of the nucleus ambiguus, which in our study also were immunoreactive for orexin A receptors, may belong to the external (loose) portion of the nucleus ambiguus. Such vagal preganglionic neurons may contribute to the control of respiration by the pre-Botzinger complex or else may not be directly involved in the control of respiratory timing. A diversity of function of orexin-sensitive neurons in the medulla may explain the stimulatory effects of orexin on respiratory amplitude and the apparent lack of an effect on respiratory timing..
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	67	Considerable numbers of orexin containing fibers were present within the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat. This finding is in accordance with recent data that orexin-containing neurons innervate vagal preganglionic cells within the nucleus ambiguus (12). However, we found little retrograde transport of CTB infused into this area to hypothalamic orexin-ir neurons, and CTB-labeled cells were mostly located medial to orexin-ir neurons. Because CTB is taken up by synaptic vesicles, the possibility exists that synapses between pre-Botzinger complex neurons and orexinergic fibers of passage may be sparse. It may be that orexin released from passing fibers nonsynaptically activates receptors or that orexin circulating within cerebrospinal fluid may activate neurons that contain orexin receptors (volume transmission), in analogy with the effects of endogenously released catecholamines in this region (2, 23). Medullary neurons ventral to the compact portion of the nucleus ambiguus, which in our study also were immunoreactive for orexin A receptors, may belong to the external (loose) portion of the nucleus ambiguus. Such vagal preganglionic neurons may contribute to the control of respiration by the pre-Botzinger complex or else may not be directly involved in the control of respiratory timing. A diversity of function of orexin-sensitive neurons in the medulla may explain the stimulatory effects of orexin on respiratory amplitude and the apparent lack of an effect on respiratory timing..

This finding is in accord with numerous other studies of orexin receptors found throughout the brain stem and in more rostral brain regions (6, 7, 15, 19, 28, 46). Furthermore, these findings for the first time indicate that identified phrenic motor neurons express orexin receptors..

An increase in peak integrated moving average activity of the diaphragm without changes in respiratory timing indicates that these neurons are involved in the regulation of tidal volume activity of inspiratory pumping muscles, independent of frequency discharge. However, these results do not exclude a critical role of inspiratory rhythm-generating cells of the pre-Botzinger complex for the control of respiratory timing (17)..

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	74	Orexin may also affect respiration via projections to other sites, e.g., it may cause an increase in respiratory drive via activation of hypothalamic neurons that project to the pre-Botzinger complex and to phrenic nuclei (14, 26, 29, 41, 50). Furthermore, the activity of upper airway dilating muscles such as the genioglossus muscle could be affected via direct projections of orexin-containing neurons to hypoglossal motoneurons and activation of orexin-1 receptors expressed by hypoglossal motor cells that innervate that muscle (48). In addition, dense orexinergic projections innervate the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord where the majority of sympathetic preganglionic neuronal cell bodies reside (13, 46). This indicates that lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons may act directly on different brain stem and spinal cord cell groups, providing parallel control to cardiovascular and respiratory related output neurons during behavioral state control, defensive responses, and energy homeostasis (22, 42)..
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	75	Orexin, when topically applied to the spinal cord, had slight but significant effects on heart rate. These findings are in accord with other data showing that intracisternal or intrathecal injections of orexin A or B provoke a dose-related increase in heart rate and sympathetic neuronal activity in urethane anesthetized rats. Orexin given by these routes could activate multiple central nervous system and spinal orexin-sensitive sites, including excitatory brain stem neurons and spinal cord sympathetic preganglionic neurons (3, 10). We observed no effects of medullary infusions of orexin on heart rate, possibly because our rats were vagotomized (12)..

These neurons also, as shown by the present study, are involved in regulation of the breathing activity, via projections to the brain stem-spinal cord respiratory related network, presumably through the orexin R1 signaling pathway. This is in accord with a recent report that stimulation of the perifornical (lateral) hypothalamus elicits increases in respiratory activity, a response diminished in mice genetically engineered to lack orexin (25). If, in humans, orexin proves to stimulate respiration, then a deficit in orexin action may contribute to a decrease in respiratory drive during sleeping (for review, see Ref. 23). This assumption is consistent with recent findings indicating that orexin plays an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness (for reviews, see Refs. 28, 49)..

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	82	A decreased influence of orexin in brain regions that regulate sleep and breathing could cause simultaneous decreases in both arousal and respiratory drive. Recently, it was reported that patients with sleep apnea had decreased blood levels of orexin, relative to controls (34). The mechanisms that could produce a decreased production of orexin are unknown but may be related to the apparent link between obesity and sleep apnea. It is well known that obesity is the most prominent risk factor for sleep apnea (30, 56). Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia also appear to provoke sleep apnea (47). It seems likely that some metabolic alterations provoked by obesity, possibly elevations in circulating nutrient molecules, could partly explain the association between obesity and sleep apnea..

Thus orexin-containing neurons may be a key component in the connection between obesity and sleep apnea. Further study will be required to investigate this hypothesis..

Orexin, acting via orexin R1 expressed by pre-Botzinger neurons and the phrenic nuclei, increases respiratory drive.

The existence of a large number of contributing loci and gene-gene as well as gene-environment interactions make it difficult to identify the disease genes underlying these complex traits. In mouse models of obesity and Type II diabetes such as the murine fat mutation, genetic crosses can be used to dissect the genetic complexity influencing the observed phenotypes. The underlying defect in the fat mutant is a Ser202Pro change in carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme responsible for the final proteolytic processing step of prohormone intermediates. On the HRS/J (HRS) inbred strain background, mice homozygous for the fat mutation exhibit early onset hyperinsulinemia followed by postpubertal moderate obesity without hyperglycemia. In contrast, on the C57BLKS/J (BKS) genetic background, fat/fat mice become severely obese, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic. Therefore, in the Cpefat genetic model, the fat mutation is necessary but not sufficient for the development of obesity, Type II diabetes, and related metabolic disorders. To dissect the susceptibility loci responsible for modifying obesity- and diabetes-associated traits, we characterized, both genetically and phenotypically, fat/fat male progeny from a large intercross between BKS. HRS-fat/fat and HRS-+/+ mice. Four major loci were mapped, including a locus for body weight (body weight 1) on chromosome 14; a locus for hyperglycemia (fat-induced diabetes 1) on chromosome 19; a locus for hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypercholesterolemia (fat-induced diabetes 2) on chromosome 5; and a locus for adiposity and body weight (fat-induced adiposity 1) on chromosome 11. The identification of these interacting genetic determinants for obesity and Type II diabetes may allow better definition of the obesity/diabetes-related hormone signaling pathways and ultimately may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of these complex diseases..

Presumably, the genetic dissection of these complex traits in humans has been difficult because of their polygenic nature, the genetic heterogeneity, and gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions on the disease traits (4, 7, 23). For this reason, genetic studies of obesity and diabetes have extended to the use of mouse models. The mouse constitutes a useful model system because a large number of animals can be bred while controlling for genetic and environmental influences. These advantages are necessary to study the epistatic effects of mutated genes on susceptibility loci..

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	7	Five single-gene mutations that result in an obese phenotype have been identified in mice, one of which is the fat mutation. The fat mutation is a single nucleotide change in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) gene resulting in a 202Ser to Pro change in the CPE protein in fat mice (22). The CPE gene (Cpe) encodes an enzyme responsible for the processing of hormones, such as insulin and proopiomelanocortin. CPE is present at high concentrations in secretory granules of the pancreatic islets and is required for the excision of residual dibasic residues remaining at the carboxy-terminal end of propeptides after processing by the endolytic prohormone convertases PCSK1 and PCSK2 (10). The mutation in Cpefat renders the enzyme unstable, and it is ultimately degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum. The reduction in CPE activity in turn leads to a decrease of biologically active hormones such as insulin. CPE defects have also been observed in other tissues, including the hypothalamus, which suggests that a number of additional prohormones may be implicated in the obesity phenotype such as neuropeptides, melanin-stimulating hormone (3), or melanin-concentrating hormone (25)..

HRS-fat/fat mice exhibit early chronic hyperinsulinemia followed by mature onset obesity without hyperglycemia. When the fat mutation was transferred to the C57BLKS/J (BKS) background, male mice harboring the mutation in a homozygous state became hyperglycemic after the sixth backcross generation (N6). In addition, BKS-fat/fat mice exhibit elevated plasma triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol levels. As the background strain difference with respect to diabetes development demonstrates, Cpefat is necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of diabesity (obesity/diabetes) in the Cpefat model. Other susceptibility loci must interact with fat to produce the hyperglycemia and other metabolic phenotypes observed in BKS-fat/fat mice. To dissect the susceptibility loci interacting with Cpefat, we performed a genetic analysis of male mice homozygous for the Cpefat mutation from a large (BKS x HRShr/+ or +/+) F1 Cpefat/+ intercross [the inbred HRS strain also carries a mutation in the hairless gene (hr)]. For temporal phenotypes such as body weight and plasma glucose, we constructed sets of derived phenotypes to capture key aspects of longitudinal measurements such as rate, flux, and severity of each phenotype. Here, we present the outcome of a genome-wide screen for susceptibility loci that interact with Cpefat in the development of obesity- and diabetes-related disorders..

Plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured using commercial colorimetric assays (Sigma; St. Louis, MO; and Roche; Indianapolis, IN). To determine HDL-cholesterol levels, low-density and very-low-density lipoprotein particles were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (15). To determine plasma triglyceride levels, free glycerol was subtracted from the total glycerol content. Plasma insulin levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco; St. Louis, MI).

PCR conditions for Cpe primers have been previously described (19). Cycling conditions for PCR-amplification of hr were as follows: 94 degrees C for 2 min followed by 49 cycles of 94 degrees C for 20 s, 50 degrees C for 30 s, and 72 degrees C for 30 s. A final extension was done at 72 degrees C for 7 min. PCRs were done in a 10- microl volume containing 1x PCR buffer (Roche), 100 ng genomic DNA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 nM dNTPs, 0.25 units Taq polymerase, 0.2  microM primer F1 (5'-agggaggtcagagcctctg-3'), 0.1  microM primer R1(5'-ggtcctcctgtttgcttgg-3'), and 0.1  microM primer F2 (5'-gccactccttgaacctgtg-3'). DNAs were separated on a 3% metaphor-1% agarose gel (BMA; Rockland, ME), stained with ethidium bromide, and examined under ultraviolet light. DNA from heterozygous hr/+ animals yielded two fragments of 910 and 581 bps, respectively..

To identify polymorphic regions between the BKS and HRS strains across the genome, DNA from parental BKS-fat/fat N6, BKS-fat/fat N10, and HRS-+/+ mice was typed for single stranded length polymorphism (SSLP) markers (Research Genetics) using PCR assays as previously described (14). Initially, a total of 87 SSLP markers at an average spacing of 20 cM was tested for the genome scan, with the largest gap being 47 cM between markers D1Mit26 and D1Mit17 (marker information available upon request). Additional markers were tested for chromosomal regions showing significant linkage. At this resolution, we detected (1/87 markers tested in the scan) a region on chromosome 17 that differed between BKS-fat/fat N6 and N10 animals. N6 animals were all HRS genotype at D17Mit142, whereas N10 animals were segregating with HRS and BKS alleles. Because these areas and other HRS contaminated regions may exist [up to 2% of the genome (2)], a BKS-modifying QTL may have been missed. Of the 2,838 F2 mice generated from the intercross, DNA from 282 fat/fat F2 male progeny was PCR amplified. Only 10% of fat/fat male mice instead of the expected 12.5% were available because some mice died early or were lost before the completion of the study. Approximately, 83% of all possible genotypes were complete. To determine whether a QTL modified a trait in absence of the Cpe defect, a genome scan was performed on DNA from 48 F2-fat/+ and 24 F2-+/+ mice..

These animals were removed from the data set before analysis. The phenotypic profiles of the F2 progeny were obtained using one-way ANOVA. In examining the longitudinal data of the male F2-fat/fat mice, we noted different patterns of disease progression. For example, some mice became hyperglycemic early and sustained their hyperglycemia, others were transiently hyperglycemic, and others showed a slow but moderate rise in plasma glucose levels. To address the longitudinal nature of our phenotypes, we created derived phenotypes for body weight and plasma glucose. This allowed us to obtain results that have a clear biological interpretation, i.e., to detect modifiers that act early or late in the disease process (change), that affect the rate of disease progression (curvature), that affect disease severity (final), or that remain constitutively expressed throughout the time course (average). This also makes our results comparable with future studies that may measure body weight progression at different time points or even at irregular time intervals. We constructed the following sets of derived phenotypes..

A one-dimensional genome scan, also commonly referred to as a genome scan, is a survey of all single-locus models explaining the phenotype. This amounts to performing an ANOVA at every locus when complete genotype information is available. We examine how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every locus and summarize the statistical evidence that a locus affects the phenotype by the LOD score. A two-dimensional genome scan is a survey of all two-locus models explaining the phenotype. Here, we examined how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every pair of loci in the genome. For both one-dimensional and two-dimensional scans, we included an additive cohort effect for the three cohorts of mice. This method of analysis is able to combine the overall evidence in favor of a locus in all three cohorts while respecting their differences. The rationale for the combining of crosses has been previously reported and used in other studies (1, 8, 17, 31). Genotypes from chromosome 8 (linked to the fat mutation) and distal chromosome 17 (cohort I and II animals) were all HRS genotype and hence excluded from the genome analysis. After the genome scans, a two-stage model selection procedure was followed..

All loci that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional scans were selected. We selected locus pairs as follows. All pairs that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold in the two-dimensional scan for the full two-locus model were subjected to secondary tests. To determine whether both loci in a pair were acting additively, we compared the two-locus additive model to both single locus models dropping each locus in turn. For the comparison, we used a nominal P value of 0.002. This corresponds approximately to the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional genome scan. We then tested the interaction component of the two-locus model using a nominal P value of 0.0001. This corresponds to a 5% permutation test threshold for the interaction test only..
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	28	Backward elimination. Backward elimination has been previously described (5). All loci and locus pairs selected in the previous stage were put together in a multiple-QTL model. The additive cohort effect was always included in the multiple-QTL model. The multiple-QTL model was formed by selecting the marker closest to the locus. If there were genotypes missing at the markers, the multiple-imputation method (26) was used to account for the missing genotypes. The basic idea is that the missing genotypes can be probabilistically inferred from the genotypes of nearby markers. This is done by simulating the missing genotype at the marker conditional on the flanking typed markers. To account for the uncertainty in our knowledge of the true genotypes, a number of imputations (26) were used. Each term in the model (including the cohort effect) was dropped, and the change in the LOD score was noted. (This corresponds to a type III ANOVA.) If the nominal P value of the change in the LOD score was  > 0.002 for the main effects and  > 0.0001 for the interactions, that term was dropped. This procedure was continued until no term could be dropped..

Two loci for Cpefat-induced diabetes (find1 and find2) were detected on chromosomes 19 and 5, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). For find2, mice homozygous for BKS-derived alleles (BB) exhibited higher plasma glucose levels than their BH and homozygous HH littermates, whereas for find1, the presence of a HRS allele resulted in elevated plasma glucose levels. The find2 locus was found to affect other metabolic features besides plasma glucose such as insulin and total cholesterol levels. With the use of the backward elimination, multiple-QTL model, no locus, including find2, was identified as having an interaction with find1. The fact that no significant interaction was detected with find1 was surprising because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become diabetic. Because hr is segregated in the crosses, we hypothesized that the find1 effect on plasma glucose may be dependent on the hr genotype on chromosome 14. We compared the plasma glucose means of mice homozygous for the HRS-derived allele at find1 with two genotypic cohorts, BB and HH, at D14Mit115, a marker tightly linked to the hr locus (Table 6).

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	62	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease in the human population often associated with increased susceptibility to comorbidities such as Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension (30). The susceptibility of BKS.HRS-fat/fat mice and resistance of HRS-fat/fat mice to Type II diabetes make the mutant fat mouse a useful model to study gene interactions in the development of diabesity. In this study, two major loci for hyperglycemia (find2 and find1) were identified on chromosomes 5 and 19, respectively. F2 fat/fat mice that are homozygous for the BKS-derived allele of find2 have an increased susceptibility and mice that are homozygous for the HRS-derived allele are resistant to hyperglycemia. Hence, we hypothesize that find2 may be the locus that protects HRS-fat/fat mice from developing diabetes. It has been known previously that the BKS genetic background is diabetogenic (7). In a C57BLKS/J x C57BL/6J-Leprdb/Leprdb intercross, two putative loci for hyperglycemia were identified on chromosomes 8 and 17, but no QTL was detected on chromosome 5 (21). This disparity may be due to differences in how the db and fat mutations are interacting with the BKS background. Alternatively, the chromosome 8 locus may lie close to the Cpe locus, and the BKS.HRS mice used here may not carry it. In addition, only a subset of mice was analyzed in the BKS x B6 intercross (20% of highest plasma glucose and lowest plasma glucose levels), and thus the find2 locus on chromosome 5 locus may have been missed..
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	63	(BKS x HRS) F2 fat/fat mice that are homozygous for the HRS allele at find1 have elevated plasma glucose levels. Because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become hyperglycemic, this implies that find1 is interacting with additional loci from the BKS background. Our multiple-QTL model did not detect a locus interacting with find1; however, we did observe an association between plasma glucose levels of mice homozygous (HH) at find1 and their genotype near the hr locus on chromosome 14. This suggests that the hr gene (or a closely linked gene) may have an effect on find1 expression. In addition, loci closely linked to the Cpe locus on chromosome 8 cannot be ruled out, because all mice analyzed were homozygous Cpefat. Diabetes susceptibility loci have been found in the same interval as find1 on distal mouse chromosome 19 in several rodent experiments (11, 12, 16, 27). Whether all of these loci are due to mutations in the same gene remains to be determined..

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	65	A major QTL for body weight (bwt1) was identified on chromosome 14. The LOD peak of bwt1 is in close vicinity to hr, making hr a plausible candidate. Allele typing of the hr allele in the F2 progeny showed that hr/hr mutant mice had significantly lower mean body weight values than haired (+/+) mice. Hairless HRS mice (HRS-hr/hr mice) also have lower mean adipose depot and body weights than their normally haired albino (HRS-+/+) littermates (20). It has previously been shown that hairless mice have a higher metabolic rate than normally haired albino mice (9). This was attributed to greater energy requirement for thermoregulation in mice lacking body hair. However, it was recently discovered that the hr gene product acts as a corepressor to the thyroid hormone receptor (24), and the hr mutation might, therefore, mimic some of the effects of thyroid hormone on energy metabolism. Altogether, our data suggest that hr is responsible for the lowered body weight in HRS-hr/hr mice and that the hr gene itself explains some of the variance observed in F2 fat/fat males and acts independently of the fat locus. There are currently no published reports on adiposity in human patients with congenital alopecia or artrichia carrying mutations in the Hr gene, so that it is unclear whether hr mutations have the same effect on metabolism in humans as in mice..

The fact that fina1 was not observed in lean controls implies that the fina1 locus is epistatically interacting with fat, thereby, masking the effects of hr on adipose depot distribution in F2 fat/fat mutant mice. The interval for fina1 is still fairly large but includes intriguing candidates such as Hcrt and Cpd. Although no sequence variations were observed in the coding regions of both genes, the possibility of promoter defects needs further exploration..

Because obesity is often associated with alterations in neuropeptide levels, the identification of these diabesity-associated modifier QTL should also lead to a better understanding of the biological pathways and neuropeptides that may be involved in common forms of obesity..

Centrally administered ghrelin exerts an orexigenic activity through the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein systems. The interaction between ghrelin and other hypothalamic orexigenic peptides, however, has not been clarified. Here, we investigated the anatomical interactions and functional relationship between ghrelin and two orexigenic peptides, orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), present in the lateral hypothalamus. Ghrelin-immunoreactive axonal terminals made direct synaptic contacts with orexin-producing neurons. Intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin induced Fos expression, a marker of neuronal activation, in orexin-producing neurons but not in MCH-producing neurons. Ghrelin remained competent to induce Fos expression in orexin-producing neurons following pretreatment with anti-NPY IgG. Pretreatment with anti-orexin-A IgG and anti-orexin-B IgG, but not anti-MCH IgG, attenuated ghrelin-induced feeding. Administration of NPY receptor antagonist further attenuated ghrelin-induced feeding in rats treated with anti-orexin-IgGs. Ghrelin-induced feeding was also suppressed in orexin knockout mice. This study identifies a novel hypothalamic pathway that links ghrelin and orexin in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis..

0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   GHRELIN WAS ORIGINALLY isolated from human and rat stomach as a cognate endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor (GHS-R; Ref. 1). This 28-amino-acid peptide has a posttranslational n-octanoyl modification indispensable for its activity. Ghrelin stimulates GH release when peripherally or centrally administered to rats and when applied directly to rat primary pituitary cells (1, 2, 3). In addition, ghrelin administration increases food intake and body weight gain (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Whereas ghrelin secretion is up-regulated under negative energy balance conditions, including starvation, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, cachexia, and anorexia nervosa, it is down-regulated under conditions of positive energy balance, such as feeding, hyperglycemia, and obesity (10, 11, 12, 13, 14). Gastric ghrelin enters the brain across the blood-brain barrier (15). Recently, stomach-derived ghrelin s signals for starvation has been reported to be relayed to the hindbrain via the vagus afferent nerve (16)..

The ghrelin receptor, however, is extensively distributed throughout the brain to areas such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and arcuate nucleus (20, 21). Both areas contain several subsets of neurons that produce neuropeptides implicated in feeding regulation, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, proopiomelanocortin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and orexins (orexin-A and orexin-B), which are also termed hypocretins (22, 23). Centrally administered ghrelin may interact with these peptides to regulate food intake and energy homeostasis. Although the mechanism of ghrelin s orexigenic activity is related to the NPY and AgRP pathways (6, 7, 24), the interaction of ghrelin with other energy-regulating systems is unclear..

MCH, which is a 19-amino-acid neuropeptide and whose neurons are coextensive but not colocalized with orexin neurons in the LH (26), also stimulates feeding when centrally administered (27). Using electron microscope immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy, we investigated the anatomical distributions of ghrelin with orexin and MCH. We also examined the ghrelin-induced expression of c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation (28), in orexin- and MCH-expressing neurons. To investigate the functional relationship between ghrelin and orexins or MCH, we examined the effect of pretreatment with anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs or anti-MCH IgG on ghrelin-inducing feeding.

We first examined the effect of anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs or anti-MCH IgG on the suppression of feeding. They significantly reduced dark-phase food intake in comparison with control IgG treatment (Fig. 3). We next investigated the effect of endogenous orexin or MCH blockade against ghrelin-induced feeding. Ghrelin increased 2-h food intake in rats following icv administration of control IgG (Fig. 4). Pretreatment with anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs, however, reduced ghrelin-induced food intake to one half of the level seen in rats given control IgG + ghrelin (Fig. 4). Pretreatment with anti-MCH IgG did not affect ghrelin-induced feeding (Fig. 4). Ghrelin-induced food intake in orexin-deficient mice was significantly reduced in comparison with wild-type littermates (Fig. 5). Y1 NPY receptor antagonist did not affect 2-h food intake. Coadministration of ghrelin and Y1 NPY receptor antagonist also reduced ghrelin-induced feeding by 41% (Fig. 6). The combination of ghrelin and Y1 NPY receptor antagonist coadministration with an icv administration of anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs additively reduced ghrelin-induced feeding by 87% (Fig. 6)..

Animals with LH lesions exhibit decreased food intake (36, 37), whereas electrical stimulation of the LH during a satiated state promotes feeding (37, 38). Orexin and MCH are orexigenic neuropeptides synthesized specifically in the LH (22, 25, 26, 27, 32, 39, 40). Ghrelin fibers project to the LH to synapse on orexin-immunoreactive neurons. Icv administration of ghrelin induced Fos expression in orexin-expressing neurons but not in MCH-expressing neurons; this result is consistent with a recent finding that icv administration of GHRP-6, a synthetic GH-releasing hexapeptide that binds to the ghrelin receptor (41), induced Fos in a similar neuronal pattern (9). These findings indicate that ghrelin may stimulate feeding through both the orexin system and the NPY and AgRP systems..

Food intake induced by ghrelin was attenuated by anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs, but not anti-MCH IgG pretreatment. In addition, ghrelin-induced food intake in mice deficient in orexin was significantly lower than that seen in wild-type littermates. These data suggest that centrally administered ghrelin increases food intake through the action of the orexin system. To date, six functional NPY receptors (Y1 to Y6) have been identified (48, 49). NPY stimulates feeding predominantly through Y1 NPY receptor (33, 50). Icv injection of an Y1 NPY receptor antagonist significantly reduced ghrelin-induced food intake. Moreover, coadministration of ghrelin and Y1 NPY receptor antagonist following anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs pretreatment abolished ghrelin-induced feeding. Therefore, ghrelin likely interacts with both the NPY and orexin systems to induce feeding..

The mediator of the interaction between positive energy balance and physical activity is unknown. In this study, we address the hypothesis that orexin A acts in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to increase nonfeeding-associated physical activity. PVN-cannulated rats were injected with either orexin A or vehicle during the light and dark cycle. Spontaneous physical activity (SPA) was measured using arrays of infrared activity sensors and night vision videotaped recording (VTR). O2 consumption and CO2 production were measured by indirect calorimetry. Feeding behavior was assessed by VTR. Regardless of the time point of injection, orexin A (1 nmol) was associated with dramatic increases in SPA for 2 h after injection (orexin A: 6.27  plus or minus  1.95 x 103 beam break count, n = 24; vehicle: 1.85  plus or minus  1.13 x 103, n = 38). This increase in SPA was accompanied by compatible increase in O2 consumption. Duration of feeding was increased only when orexin A was injected in the early light phase and accounted for only 3.5  plus or minus  2.5% of the increased physical activity. In a dose-response experiment, increases in SPA were correlated with dose of orexin A linearly up to 2 nmol. PVN injections of orexin receptor antagonist SB-334867 were associated with decreases in SPA and attenuated the effects of PVN-injected orexin A. Thus orexin A can act in PVN to increase nonfeeding-associated physical activity, suggesting that this neuropeptide might be a mediator of NEAT..

We found that changes in nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) mediate resistance to weight gain with overfeeding in sedentary adults (32).

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	9	Orexins (A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2) are recently identified neuropeptides synthesized exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus, an area classically believed to be a crucial "feeding" center (25). Initial interest in these neuropeptides concentrated on their orexigenic actions, since central injection of orexins increased food intake, and prepro-orexin mRNA was shown to be upregulated with fasting (50). Apart from appetite regulation, orexins have been implicated in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of arousal and sleep, cardiovascular function, temperature, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, pituitary secretion, glucose homeostasis, and gastric acid secretion (17, 37, 48, 51, 53, 58). Edwards et al. (12) reported that, following intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A, hypothalamic c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was highly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and orexin A injected directly into the PVN stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful. These authors suggested that the PVN might not be the primary site of action of the orexins in their orexigenic role; rather, the orexins might perform some other role via the PVN. The PVN is demonstrated to be one of the sites innervated by orexin-containing neurons (39, 44) and to express orexin receptor 2 (36, 62)..

Stereotaxic coordinates were determined from the rat brain atlas of Paxinos and Watson (42) and are as follows: -0.5 mm lateral and -1.9 mm posterior to bregma and 7.3 mm below the skull surface. The injector extended 1 mm beyond the end of the guide cannula. For all cannulations, the incisor bar was set at 3.3 mm below the ear bars. At least 10 days elapsed following surgery before experimental trials. After the experiments, brains were dissected out and stored in a 10% formaldehyde solution for placement verification by histology. This verification was performed in a blinded fashion whereby the physical activity data were unknown to the histologist. A cannula was deemed incorrect if the actual injection site was farther than 0.25 mm away from the targeted site. This rationale is based on diffusion coefficients of injection volume delivered (40) and our previous data (28, 60). Rats with misplaced cannulas were excluded from data analysis in studies 1-3. The number of rats listed in the experimental design represents the number of rats in the final analysis (all cannulas correctly placed)..

Figure 1 represents the mean 24-h time course of SPA (Fig. 1A) and oxygen consumption (Fig. 1B) in experiment 1. Orexin A was associated with an increase in SPA for 1-2 h after injection followed by a decrease in SPA for 1-3 h afterward. The same pattern in SPA was observed after orexin A injections in experiments 2 and 3 (data not shown). Transition of O2 consumption in response to orexin A was very similar to that of SPA; orexin A was associated with an increase in O2 consumption for 1-2 h after injection. Regardless of the time point of injection, orexin A was associated with dramatic increases in SPA for 2 h after injection (Fig. 2, A and B). With all experiments combined, the mean  plus or minus  SD of SPA for 2 h after injection was as follows: orexin A, 6.27  plus or minus  1.95 x 103 beam break count; and vehicle, 1.85  plus or minus  1.13 x 103 (no. of injections was 24 for orexin A-treated animals and 38 for aCSF-treated animals). Interestingly, there was no difference in total SPA for 24 h between orexin A and vehicle in all three experiments (orexin A, 3.80  plus or minus  0.86 x 104 beam break count, n = 15; vehicle, 3.60  plus or minus  0.52 x 104 beam break count, n = 22). Types of orexin A-induced physical activity were primarily intense grooming and face washing behavior and secondarily rearing and searching behavior. These behaviors appeared immediately ( < 5 min) after the injections. After review of the videotaped recording, it was apparent that the intensity of orexin A-induced behavior was greater than for similar types of spontaneous activities (grooming and rearing) observed in the absence of experimental manipulations..

For 2 h after the injection, SPA and thermogenesis were measured without food and water. Both SPA (Fig. 4A) and thermogenesis (Fig. 4B) were well correlated with a dose of orexin A in the examined range. Orexin A at 0.125 nmol was associated with a significant increase in SPA, and the lower dose, 0.0625 nmol, was associated with a significant increase in thermogenesis. There was a strong correlation between SPA (difference of SPA between orexin A and vehicle) and thermogenesis (difference of thermogenesis between orexin A and vehicle) (r = 0.774, P  <  0.0001, n = 30)..

We proposed that a potential mediator of SPA is orexin A. Furthermore, we thought that orexin A might mediate this effect via the PVN. To address the hypothesis that orexin A in the PVN mediates SPA, we injected rats with orexin A or vehicle control and monitored SPA by use of infrared beams and videotape recording. The data demonstrated that orexin A, in all the animals where the cannula was sited in the PVN, was associated with dramatic increases in SPA for 2 h after the injection. After these 2 h, SPA did not return to baseline, but the animals appeared to compensate and become more sedentary than controls for the next 1-3 h. Increases in SPA for 2 h after injection were dose dependent. In incorrectly cannulated rats, no increase in SPA was observed after the orexin A injection. These data demonstrate a potential role for orexin A at the PVN in SPA and moreover demonstrate that SPA may be intricately modulated through neurohumoral factors in the hypothalamus..

Decreases in SPA followed the antagonist injection, and it partially blocked the effect of orexin A on both SPA and thermogenesis. SB-334867 has a 50-fold higher affinity for the OX1R than for the OX2R (11). In the rat brain, differential expression of OX1R and OX2R has been reported, and OX2R was predominantly expressed in the PVN (36, 62). OX1R is considered to be a selective receptor for orexin A, and OX2R is considered to be a nonselective receptor for both orexin A and orexin B. Despite lower affinity at OX2R, high concentration of SB-334867 at the site, the PVN, might attenuate the effect of orexin A via block of OX2R; however, because it was also reported that intraperitoneal injection of this compound attenuated orexin A-evoked grooming (11), selective OX2R antagonist is needed to verify the role of the receptor subtype in the effect of orexin A at the PVN..

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	68	Our data are consistent with other observations regarding the neurohumoral role of orexin A. Central orexin systems may be critical regulators of sleep/wake states based on neuroanatomic and genetic data (7, 8, 13, 34, 41, 44). Specifically, orexin A may activate arousal centers (17). Our observations that PVN-injected orexin A induces SPA are compatible with the fact that orexin A acts to maintain the waking state (47). The behaviors that we observed in response to orexin A injection were consistent with wakefulness, namely, intense grooming, face-washing behavior, and rearing and searching activity. Several reports also describe an immediate increase in grooming, face-washing activity, and locomotor activity after intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A (17, 21, 22, 24, 38). Additionally, there are reports showing the relationship between endogenous orexin and locomotor activity. Kiyashchenko et al. (27) showed that orexin A release into cerebrospinal fluid was higher during active waking than in quiet waking in cats. Estabrooke et al. (15) reported that Fos expression in orexin neurons correlated with locomotor activity in rats. Moreover, Hara et al. (18) showed that genetic ablation of orexin neurons in mice resulted in a decrease in spontaneous motor activity and that these transgenic mice became obese despite hypophagia. These reports also strongly suggest that orexin plays a role in regulation of SPA..

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	70	Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is suggested to be involved in orexin A-induced behaviors (21), because it is known that grooming behavior is closely associated with environmental stress (16), and intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A increases plasma corticosterone (17, 31) and adreno-corticotropin levels (23, 52). Intracerebroventricular administration of CRF increased grooming behavior (30) and intracerebroventricular administration of -helical CRF, a CRF antagonist, blocked the orexin-induced behaviors, specifically grooming and face washing (22). In terms of brain concentration, CRF is synthesized mainly in the PVN (55), and this peptide is also thought to be integral to energy balance. The PVN is one of the sites densely innervated by orexin-containing neurons and expresses OX2R (8, 36, 62). Thus our results are consistent with the thesis that orexin A stimulates these specific behaviors via CRF. The dopaminergic system is also suggested to mediate the orexin A-induced activity and grooming behavior. Involvement of the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic system in intraventricularly administered orexin-induced hyperactivity in rats has been demonstrated (38). Further study is needed to determine the downstream pathways of orexin A-induced hyperactivity..

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	72	It is known that orexin A injected into the PVN induces feeding. However, our data demonstrate that PVN-injected orexin A induced feeding behavior only when it was injected early in the light cycle when feeding behavior was minimal in control animals. There was no relation between the magnitude of orexin A-induced SPA and duration of feeding behavior. In other words, PVN-injected orexin A can increase SPA without induction of feeding behavior. This elevation in activity without concomitant feeding behavior is consistent with our previous studies examining the effect of orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus, another brain site integral to energy homeostasis (20). The early-light cycle feeding induced by PVN-injected orexin A in this study is in agreement with data from others indicating that orexin A injected into the ventricles and into the lateral hypothalamus stimulates feeding only during the light cycle (20, 67). The reason why stimulation of feeding after orexin A injection occurs only during the light cycle remains unclear. It has been demonstrated that for orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus there is a twofold greater feeding response to orexin A in food-restricted rats, which have a high level and rate of feeding (60). Thus level and/or rate of feeding are unlikely to be related to the lack of feeding after orexin during the dark cycle. Espana et al. (14) reported that orexin A-induced (icv administration) feeding was largely circadian dependent and that orexin A-induced increase in grooming was moderately circadian dependent. These authors suggested the possibility that the increase in feeding appeared to largely reflect the wake-increase actions. Other reports regarding orexin A injection into the PVN have shown variable results (10, 12, 56). Edwards et al. (12) reported that PVN-injected orexin A (0.03-0.3 nmol) stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful. Dube et al. (10) showed that 1 nmol of orexin A injected into the PVN stimulated food intake, but they reported no other behavioral effects than feeding and drinking. Differences in dose of orexin A (0.03-1 nmol, injected under light cycle in all reports) and the generally moderate effect of orexin A on feeding may explain the discrepant results in feeding response between these three reports. In the present study, we injected 1 nmol of orexin A and observed increased feeding when it was injected in the early light cycle, and we also observed remarkably increased physical activity. This observation contrasts somewhat with that of Dube et al.; however, they did not examine SPA. We recorded animals' behavior by using videotaped recording and quantified their activity by using arrays of infrared activity sensors. Our results suggest that orexin A in the PVN acts predominantly to increase nonfeeding physical activity..

These observations suggest that identifiable genetic components may exist to account for variance in NEAT. Additionally, we observed NEAT to increase with positive energy balance (32). Recently, decreased plasma orexin A levels in obese individuals was demonstrated (2). Because orexin A can pass the blood-brain barrier (26), peripheral orexin A levels might reflect its CNS levels. In the mouse hypothalamus, age-related decline in OX2R messenger RNA levels has been shown (59), and it is known that old rats have decreased activity (43). The decline in orexin with obesity and aging may support the hypothesis that orexin A in the PVN is a mediator of NEAT. Lubkin and Stricker-Krongrad (35) reported that intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A resulted in an increase in metabolic rate that was not dependent on an increase in activity in mice. We measured O2 consumption and CO2 production by indirect calorimetry. Increased O2 consumption accompanied increased activity and the thermogenic response to orexin A, which clearly tracks the orexin A effect on SPA. Thus we consider the increase in O2 consumption and thermogenesis to be a result of the increase in SPA associated with orexin A. The reason for this contrast may be due to differences in injection site between studies; site-specific injections reach a much more limited receptor population than ventricular injections. With a ventricular injection, it is unknown where injectate ultimately and predominantly reaches; thus effects observed could result from stimulation of receptors at multiple locations..

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	76	Unlike neuropeptide Y, a potent orexigenic and hypothermic signal with a clearly defined pattern in energy balance states, orexin A activity in energy balance states appears to be more complicated. Some studies show no difference in orexin A activity after fasting, (3, 45, 65), whereas others show elevated orexin expression or activity after fasting (50, 66, 69). Orexin A activity during states of positive energy balance has not been thoroughly tested. One study showed that high-fat feeding increased gene expression of orexin A (64), which is consistent with our hypothesis of increased orexin activity with positive energy balance. However, studies of obese animal models show either decreases in orexin A expression or activity (6, 54, 68) or no change (57, 61). These conflicting data likely represent the complicated role of orexin A in energy balance: although orexin administration stimulates feeding, it also elevates activity, perhaps predominantly, which enhances thermogenesis. Therefore, one cannot simply place orexin A in the class of obesity-promoting neuropeptides on the basis of its feeding-stimulatory properties. This is clearly illustrated by the data from Hara et al. (18), who demonstrated that loss of orexin A activity resulted in an obese animal model. Although these animals ate less, they were also much less active. The obese state of the animals in this study indicates that the decreased energy expenditure brought about by the loss of orexin A function was clearly more potent than the hypophagia in affecting energy balance. Thus, although the present data and those of others (18, 64) indicate that positive energy balance may stimulate orexin A, further studies examining endogenous orexin A activity in lean and obese animal models during overfeeding paradigms will help to determine what role orexin A plays in modulating NEAT..

Infusion of orexin A at a dose of 0.3 nmol into the third cerebral ventricle decreased BAT sympathetic nerve activity, compared with the effect of PBS (P  <  0.05), whereas infusion of orexin B at the same dose caused a significant increase (P  <  0.05). Pretreatment with a third cerebral ventricle injection of 2.24  micromol/kg -fluoromethylhistidine, an irreversible inhibitor of the histamine-synthesizing enzyme histidine decarboxylase, attenuated the orexin B-induced response of BAT sympathetic nerve activity, but not that induced by orexin A. These results indicate that orexins may regulate both BAT energy expenditure and thermogenesis through their dual effects on sympathetic nerve activity. In particular, orexin B regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity via neuronal histamine in the hypothalamus..

Orexin neurons are located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), from which they innervate almost all regions of the brain except the cerebellum (1, 2). Especially dense projections are observed in specific regions of the thalamus, limbic system, and aminergic nuclei, such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), serotonergic raphe nucleus, and histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) (3, 4). Concomitantly, the presence of orexin receptors has been identified in these nuclei, namely OX1R in the LC and OX2R in the TMN (5). Hypothalamic histamine neurons, with cell bodies in the TMN, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions, such as feeding behavior, drinking behavior, and thermoregulation, as well as the autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine systems (6). The orexin-histamine signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, although its involvement in other hypothalamic functions remains unclear (7)..

The regulation of energy expenditure in BAT is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system and higher brain structures. Discrete hypothalamic nuclei and various orexigenic or anorexigenic neuropeptides regulate BAT metabolism by affecting efferent sympathetic nerve activity (8, 9, 10, 11). Hypothalamic neuronal histamine, an anorexigenic substance, increases BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12). Orexins affect energy balance and thermoregulation. Orexin A has been shown to induce hypothermia and food intake, and both orexins increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (13, 14, 15, 16). Therefore, it is highly probable that orexins regulate BAT energy expenditure and thermogenesis by influencing sympathetic nerve activity. We thus hypothesized that hypothalamic neuronal histamine may mediate orexin signals to the sympathetic nerves that innervate BAT, because the close relationship between these two systems has been recognized both anatomically and functionally (17, 18). This study therefore examined the effects of central administration of orexins on electrophysiological sympathetic nerve activity in BAT and modulation of these responses by neuronal histamine..

After dissection of the fine branches of the sympathetic nerves that innervate the interscapular BAT, the nerves were transected where they entered the BAT. Nerve activity was measured using a pair of silver-wire electrodes, which were immersed in a mixture of liquid paraffin and white petroleum jelly to prevent dehydration of the nerve tissue. The action potentials were amplified and filtered with low- and high-frequency cutoffs. The nerve signal was distinguished from background noise using a window discriminator. All nerve activity was analyzed based on values obtained after conversion of the raw data to standard pulses using an analog-to-digital converter. Impulses were integrated by a rate meter with a reset time of 5 sec and recorded using a chart recorder. Details of this nerve recording technique have been described elsewhere (8, 20). After determination of the background firing rate of the sympathetic nerves, changes in nerve activity were measured for up to 60 min after each bolus i3vt infusion with orexin A (0 to 3 nmol/rat, 1.0  microl/min, 10 min), orexin B (0 to 3 nmol/rat, 1.0  microl/min, 10 min), FMH (0 to 3  micromol/kg, 1.0  microl/min, 10 min), or PBS (n = 4 for each treatment). The doses of orexins and FMH were determined by previous studies (21, 22) and in our preliminary study. Infusions of orexins were performed 2 h after pretreatment with FMH at 1300 h. Nerve activity was measured at 10-min intervals, beginning 20 min before and continuing for 60 min after administration of the test solution. Nerve activity values recorded after the administration of each test solution were expressed as the percentage difference from the baseline value (at 0 min). The baseline 100% on figures signifies the 60-min averages score of BAT sympathetic nerve activity before the orexin treatment. For the analysis of dose dependence, orexins intracerebroventricular (icv) or PBS icv infusion was performed, and sympathetic nerve activity in BAT was recorded at 20 and 40 min after the infusion..

Depletion of neuronal histamine by pretreatment with FMH attenuated the sympathetic nerve responses induced by orexin B but not those induced by orexin A, indicating that the action of orexin B is mediated by neuronal histamine. Thus, it is likely that the dual effects of orexin on BAT sympathetic nerve may depend on differences in peptide subtype and/or its target neuronal substance. We present here a discussion of how orexin differentiates its actions on sympathetic nerves, as well as the effects on neuronal histamine..

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	34	The actions of orexins are mediated via two G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R and OX2R (1, 2). The receptor binding affinity of orexin A is 10 to 100 times greater than orexin B for OX1R, whereas both orexins are equipotent for OX2R (2, 23, 24, 25). Distinct expression patterns of the two receptor subtypes have been identified throughout the brain (5). Considering the i3vt infusion site used in this study, the target site for the binding of orexin to receptors may be either the hypothalamus or the brain stem. From this standpoint, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the A5 cell group, and the LC, all of which express high levels of OX1R mRNA, may be candidates as targets of orexin A, because these nuclei have been identified as central origins of efferent pathways to the BAT and to each other (26)..

The PVN and medial preoptic area were identified as major hypothalamic origins of efferent pathways to BAT in a neuroanatomical study (26). In fact, chemical stimulation of these nuclei increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8). From the ARC, the LHA (especially orexin neurons themselves), and the PVN, direct neuronal projections to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord, a location of sympathetic preganglionic neurons, have been identified (27, 28). Among these nuclei, cumulative evidence indicates the importance of the LHA and the ARC in orexin-A-OX2R signaling to suppress BAT sympathetic nerve activity. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated an excitatory effect of orexin A on LHA neuronal activity and an inhibitory influence of this area on BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8), indicating that the LHA is a target site of orexin A for regulation of the sympathetic innervation of BAT..

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	38	In contrast to the suppressive effects of orexin A, central administration of orexin B in the present study increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity. In addition, this orexin B-induced response was attenuated by histamine depletion caused by pretreatment with FMH. As described above, the presence of orexin neurons, as well as the orexin receptor OXR2, has been identified in the TMN, a site of origin for histamine neurons (29). It has been demonstrated that neuronal histamine mediates orexin signaling in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle (30). Finally, central administration of histamine has been shown to increase BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12). Taken together, the evidence suggests that it is highly probable that orexin B regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity in an excitatory manner through OX2R in the TMN. Our unpublished observation demonstrated that FMH treatment, but not neuropeptide Y antagonist, influenced orexin B-induced feeding and/or sympathetic nerve activity. The results suggested that neuronal histamine, but not neuropeptide Y, might be closely involved in the orexin B-induced feeding behavior and sympathetic nerve activity. Further study is necessary to clarify the details of this mechanism..

In addition, modulation of OXR in the outside of the hypothalamus, such as cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and the cisterna magna, is also possible.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	42	Functional studies have recently demonstrated that central administration of orexin A or orexin B induces hypothermia or hyperthermia, respectively (14, 15). These results are consistent with the present study, because the time course of BAT thermogenesis, as assessed by local BAT temperature, was similar to that observed for BAT sympathetic nerve activity (32). On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated an orexin A-induced hyperthermic response in unanesthetized animals (33, 34). It is well known that arousal state and muscle movement affect body temperature; in the unanesthetized condition, administration of orexin A induced an increase in arousal level and consequent arbitrary movements, both of which may elevate body temperature. There was the possibility that anesthesia might modulate BAT sympathetic nerve activity and thermogenesis because anesthesia is a factor, but not the sole mechanism, regulating arousal state and body temperature. Because the present study was limited to the acute phase of orexins  effects in anesthetized rats, it is possible that differences in the state of arousal may determine the effect of orexins on body temperature. In addition, the timing of infusion might influence the orexin-induced sympathetic nerve activity because the effects of orexins are clearly dependent on the sleep-wake cycle (30)..

Yet, unless stringent efforts are made to limit daytime lighting exposure, resetting of the biological clock will not occur, and melatonin and cortisol rhythms may remain out of phase with periods of sleep and wakefulness (7). Individuals working at night may, thus, be out of phase with their optimal periods of alertness and task performance. Efforts to develop agents to reset the circadian clock (i.e. "jet lag drugs") have also been largely unrealized (8). Despite the popular hype that melatonin can conveniently shift circadian phase, data to support this notion are not striking and show modest effects at best (9, 10)..

An evolving body of evidence suggests that the sleep cycle and circadian rhythmicity are integrally related, with the circadian system influencing both the timing and duration of sleep. Expressed circadian rhythms, like the sleep-wake cycle and rhythms in hormone production, are generated and regulated by a biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus (11). Damage to these nuclei results in episodes of sleep and wakefulness occurring throughout the 24-h day, rather than being consolidated at night. SCN damage also results in an increase in the total duration of sleep in primates (12)..

To assess the regulation by gonadal steroids, we investigated the effect of 17ss-estradiol in female and of testosterone in male rats on prepro-orexin and orexin receptor mRNA expression. Rats were either sham-operated or gonadectomized and subsequently treated with placebo, 17ss-estradiol, or testosterone for 21 d.

Both peptides derive from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, which is identical with the independently cloned prepro-hypocretin (2). Prepro-orexin is selectively expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area, a region involved in the control of feeding behavior (1, 2). Consequently, orexins were shown to stimulate food intake in rats when injected into the brain ventricles and prepro-orexin mRNA was up-regulated in the lateral hypothalamus by fasting (1). Orexin (hypocretin)-containing neurons project to numerous areas throughout the brain and the spinal cord, suggesting the involvement of orexins in the regulation of multiple physiological functions besides their effect on feeding behavior (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). These areas include the cerebral cortex, limbic system, locus coeruleus, and brain stem regions but also the hypothalamus itself. Accordingly, orexins were shown to regulate autonomic functions like heart rate and blood pressure (8, 9), sleep-wake behavior and arousal (10, 11, 12), and various neuroendocrine systems (13, 14, 15, 16)..

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	10	Two subtypes of orexin receptors, namely OX1 and OX2 receptors, were cloned (1). Their expression patterns in the rat brain are in good agreement with the widespread projections of orexin immunoreactive neurons (17, 18). Within the hypothalamus, OX1 receptor mRNA was detected in areas like the medial preoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus, whereas OX2 receptor mRNA was found in regions such as the paraventricular and the arcuate nucleus (18). Therefore, the effects of intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected orexins on plasma hormones such as ACTH, prolactin, LH, and GH (13, 14, 15, 16) may be mediated by affecting the synthesis and/or liberation of releasing hormones. In addition, orexins may directly influence pituitary hormones because orexinergic nerve fibers are present in the median eminence and pituitary gland and orexin receptors were detected in the pituitary gland (4, 19, 20). Indeed, orexins were shown to stimulate CRH and GnRH release from the hypothalamus (21) but also to inhibit releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH and LH release from the pituitary (22, 23). The inhibitory action of orexin on GnRH-stimulated pituitary LH release was observed only in proestrous female rats and not in male rats (22). Moreover, in female rats the effect of icv-injected orexins was dependent on the status of ovarian steroids (16). Furthermore, whereas in ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with 17ss-estradiol (E2) and progesterone icv orexin increased plasma LH levels, in untreated OVX rats orexin decreased plasma LH levels (16). One explanation for this bimodal action of orexins on LH release is a possible regulation of orexin receptors by estrogens. Interestingly, we have recently detected a sexually dimorphic expression of peripheral orexin receptors with higher mRNA levels of OX1 receptors in the pituitary and of OX2 receptors in adrenal glands of male rats when compared with female rats (20)..

In the pituitary gland of Plac-treated OVX rats, OX1 receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher compared with Plac-treated sham-operated rats (Fig. 4A). Treatment of OVX rats with E2 completely reversed the OVX-induced increase of the mRNA levels of pituitary OX1 receptors (Fig. 4A). As in control rats, low amounts of OX2 receptor mRNA were found in the pituitary glands of Plac- or E2-treated OVX rats (Fig. 4B). In adrenal glands, there were no substantial differences of the mRNA levels of OX1 receptors between the treatment groups (Fig. 4A). However, OX2 receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in Plac-treated OVX rats when compared with Plac-treated sham-operated rats and significantly reduced again by E2 treatment in OVX rats (Fig. 4B)..

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	49	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We have recently found profound differences in the mRNA levels of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors between male and female rats (20). In addition, the mRNA expression of hypothalamic prepro-orexin was higher in female rats (27). Our present results confirm the expression of OX1 receptors in the pituitary and OX2 receptors in the adrenal gland (20, 28, 29, 30, 31). Furthermore, we show for the first time that gonadal steroids affect the mRNA expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors in the pituitary and adrenal glands. The up-regulation by ovariectomy and down-regulation by E2 of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors in female rats is in accordance with the much lower mRNA levels of these receptors in intact female rats compared with male rats (20). In addition, T up-regulated adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA in male rats, whereas pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA was down-regulated. Thus, the lower pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA levels in female rats (20) may be explained by inhibitory actions of E2 in female rats. In the adrenal, both inhibitory actions of E2 in female rats and stimulatory actions of T in male rats may contribute to the differences of OX2 receptor mRNA levels between female and male rats (20)..

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	51	In addition to their effects on energy homeostasis, there is considerable evidence that orexins can regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (16, 22, 32, 33, 34). Icv injected orexins increased plasma LH concentrations in ovarian steroid-treated female rats, whereas in untreated OVX rats plasma LH was reduced as initially shown by Pu et al. (16). This bimodal response appears, in part, to be mediated by GnRH because orexin stimulates GnRH release from hypothalamic explants of male and proestrous female rats (21, 22). In addition, orexin containing neurons project to several hypothalamic nuclei including areas involved in the regulation of GnRH where orexin receptors are present (3, 4, 35, 36). However, because orexin receptors are also present in the pituitary gland, a direct effect of orexins can be assumed. In ovarian steroid-treated rats, the stimulatory effect of icv orexins on pituitary LH release was observed already at low doses, whereas a high dose of orexin was necessary to suppress the release of LH in the absence of ovarian steroids (16, 32). It could be possible that orexins, when injected icv at high doses, reach the pituitary gland by diffusion into the portal circulation and stimulate pituitary OX1 receptors, which are up-regulated in the absence of ovarian steroids as shown by our results. Although, there was no significant effect of orexin on basal LH release from dispersed pituitary cells, orexin inhibited GnRH-induced release of LH from isolated pituitary cells in proestrous female rats (22). Thus, orexins may differentially regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis by exerting contrary effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. These estrogen-dependent bimodal actions of orexins on LH release in female rats may be caused by the up-regulation of OX1 receptors at low E2 levels. Such a receptor-dependent regulation of hormone-release is well established for other peptides such as angiotensin II (37, 38)..

Although no effects of orexins on basal ACTH were observed in male and female rats, Samson and Taylor (23) reported an inhibitory effect of orexins on CRH-stimulated ACTH release in vitro. This finding is supported by the localization of orexin receptors in human corticotrope pituitary cells (30). Interestingly, the ACTH response to stress depends on gonadal steroids in both male and female rats (39, 40). The role of orexins in these responses remains unclear. However, our findings of a strong regulation of pituitary OX1 receptors by E2 and, to a lesser degree, by T, imply a so far undefined hormonal regulation of orexin actions in the pituitary gland of male and female rats..

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	55	In the adrenal gland, we found very high mRNA levels of OX2 receptors in accordance with our previous findings which also showed much higher amounts of OX2 receptor mRNA in male rats compared with female rats (20). Interestingly, gonadal hormones differentially affected the mRNA levels of adrenal OX2 receptors. E2 reduced the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors, whereas T increased the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors. Therefore, both E2 in female rats and T in male rats may contribute to the observed sex differences in adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA expression. Inconsistent data exist regarding the localization of adrenal orexin receptors. In rats, OX1 and OX2 receptor like immunoreactivity was found in the adrenal medulla but not in the cortex (28). In contrast, quantitative PCR showed much higher levels of OX2 receptor mRNA, which was selectively localized in the adrenal cortex of the rat by in situ hybridization (20). These results are supported by findings of Randeva et al. (31), who found OX2 receptors but not OX1 receptors selectively in the cortex of human adrenals using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Others, however, have described OX1 receptors in the cortex and OX2 receptors in the medulla of the human adrenal (41). Because orexins stimulate adrenal glucocorticoid release in rats and humans (42, 43) and glucocorticoids play an unique role in energy homeostasis, it is intriguing to speculate that in male rats orexins may regulate glucose metabolism via regulation of glucocorticoids. Interestingly, we found increased levels of plasma orexin A by T in male rats in contrast to female rats where plasma orexin A levels were unchanged by E2. Further experiments are needed to clarify possible T-dependent functions of the adrenal orexin system..

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	57	Thus far, it is unclear whether, in rats, adrenal OX2 receptors are stimulated by circulating orexins or whether orexins are locally produced in the adrenal gland as described by Randeva et al. (31) in humans. The presence of orexin in plasma has been described before in rats and humans and circulating orexins may activate adrenal orexin receptors (20, 44). Although the source of plasma orexins is currently uncertain, orexin-producing neurons project to the median eminence and may therefore contribute to plasma orexins (29)..
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	58	In contrast to the lower mRNA levels of orexin receptors in the pituitary and adrenal glands of female rats compared with male rats, prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor mRNA levels are elevated in the hypothalamus of female rats (20, 27). In our present study, we could not reveal changes of hypothalamic prepro-orexin or orexin receptor mRNA after gonadectomy or hormonal treatment in male and female rats. Our results in female rats are in accordance with findings of Russell et al. (22), showing no effect of estrogens on hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA in female rats. In addition, in male sheep, E2 did not affect prepro-orexin mRNA levels (45). Thus, other factors may be responsible for the observed differences between male and female rats, and it may be concluded that the central (hypothalamic) expression of prepro-orexin and orexin receptors is not under the control of ovarian steroids. However, because orexin receptor subtypes are distinctively expressed in hypothalamic nuclei (18) discrete changes of orexin receptor mRNA levels in specific hypothalamic nuclei might not be detectable by analyzing whole hypothalamic extracts using RT-PCR and cannot completely ruled out by our results..

Our findings of weight gain after ovariectomy is in accordance with previous observations (47). The reduced weight in female rats after E2 replacement may be attributed to the somewhat higher plasma E2 levels in E2-treated female rats in comparison to sham-operated female rats (47). Studies by Bernardis et al. (48) showed that OVX could influence body weight independently of food intake and separately from central mechanisms. In our study, the regulation of orexin receptors by gonadal steroids appears to be limited to peripheral organs. Thus, the peripheral orexin system and particularly adrenal OX2 receptors may contribute to sex specific regulations of energy homeostasis..

Mutant huntingtin forms intracellular aggregates and is associated with neuronal death in select brain regions. The most studied mouse model (R6/2) of HD replicates many features of the disease, but has been reported to exhibit only very little neuronal death. We describe for the first time a dramatic atrophy and loss of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of R6/2 mice. Importantly, we also found a significant atrophy and loss of orexin neurons in Huntington patients. Like animal models and patients with impaired orexin function, the R6/2 mice were narcoleptic. Both the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid were reduced by 72% in end-stage R6/2 mice compared with wild-type littermates, suggesting that orexin could be used as a biomarker reflecting neurodegeneration. Our results show that the loss of orexin is a novel and potentially very important pathology in HD..

In advanced stages, these mice display several clinical features reminiscent of HD. These include impaired motor coordination, tremor, changes in open field behavior, progressive weight loss and increased incidence of epileptic seizures (10). For unclear reasons, they die prematurely at the age of 12 to 15 weeks. Their brains exhibit a high frequency of intraneuronal nuclear inclusions of the polyglutamine-containing protein. So far, relatively little cell death, with only few scattered neurons undergoing  dark degeneration , has been described (11,12)..

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	11	Neuropathological studies of end-stage HD patients have demonstrated up to 90% neuronal loss in the tuber nucleus of the lateral hypothalamus (7,8). In humans, this region is particularly enriched in NMDA receptors (13). This implicates the involvement of excitotoxic cell death, which has repeatedly been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of HD in other brain regions (1,14). Interestingly, a recent study showed that in slice cultures of rat lateral hypothalamus, neurons containing the peptide orexin (also known as hypocretin) are particularly susceptible to excitotoxic damage (15). Orexin A and B are synthesized from the same precursor gene and are expressed in the same neurons with their cell bodies concentrated to the lateral hypothalamus (16,17). These neurons project widely throughout the central nervous system with particular dense projections to monoaminergic centers. They are thought to interact with autonomic, neuroendocrine and arousal systems through excitatory effects of orexin (reviewed in 18). Importantly, studies in mice with a null mutation of the gene for orexin (19) or one of its receptors (20) as well as transgenic mice with a targeted ablation of orexin neurons (21) revealed severe disturbances of sleep and wakefulness, similar to narcoleptic symptoms in humans (22). Subsequent studies have shown that most human narcolepsy patients have reduced levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (23) and that, in some cases, the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus is reduced (24). Taken together, these findings strongly implicate the orexin system in sleep regulation..

The reduction was not apparent at 3.5 weeks of age, but progressed significantly over time (Fig. 1E). The remaining orexin neurons were significantly atrophied in R6/2 mice compared with wild-type, as assessed by measuring the cross-sectional surface area of the cell bodies (Fig. 1F). At 12.5 weeks of age, 7% of the neurons in the lateral hypothalamus were orexin-immunoreactive in the wild-type mice compared with 2% in R6/2 mice. To confirm that there was cell loss in the lateral hypothalamus, and not only reduced orexin in surviving cells, adjacent sections were processed for cresyl violet and NeuN immunohistochemistry. At 12.5 weeks of age, we found a significant reduction of the number of cresyl violet-stained cells (4381 plus or minus 345/mm2 versus 5363 plus or minus 193/mm2, Student's t-test, P < 0.05) and NeuN-immunopositive neurons (3138 plus or minus 167/mm2 versus 3704 plus or minus 143/mm2, Student's t-test, P < 0.05) in R6/2 mice compared with wild-type controls. Interestingly, the percentage of cells lost in the lateral hypothalamus of 12.5-week-old R6/2, compared with age-matched wild-type, mice was 15% for cells immunopositive for the neuron-specific marker (NeuN) and 72% for orexin neurons. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed frequent ultrastructural signs of neurodegeneration in the lateral hypothalamus of R6/2 mice, with some neurons displaying  dark neuron degeneration  (Fig. 2) as previously described in other brain regions of R6/2 mice (11). No gliosis was apparent at 12.5 weeks of age in the R6/2 mice as assessed in hypothalamic sections processed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry (data not shown)..

At 3.5 weeks of age, R6/2 mice were indistinguishable from wild-type controls, with periods of hyperactivity and intense exploratory behavior intercalated by prolonged periods of rest and normal sleeping (Fig. 4A). However, at 7.5 weeks of age we observed several periods of brief behavioral arrest in R6/2 mice (1 to 8 episodes per mouse, group median=6; n=5) (Fig. 4A). These episodes were characterized by a sudden interruption of a purposeful motor activity associated with a change of posture that was maintained throughout the episode. This closely resembled the narcoleptic episodes that have been described in orexin knockout mice (19). At 11.5 and 12.5 weeks, these episodes became even more frequent, and over 4 h we observed 11 to 14 (group median=11, n=3) and 10 to 14 episodes of behavioral arrest per mouse (group median=13, n=3), respectively (Fig. 4A). At 12.5 weeks of age, most of the episodes occurred during the first and the third hours of the dark phase and their duration varied between 3 and 214 s (group average=62 s, n=3) (an example of the distribution of episodes for one R6/2 mouse is illustrated in Fig. 4B)..

All the R6/2 mice that were studied (n=3) showed episodes of no movement (5 to 9 episodes per mouse, group median=7). Two of the animals also exhibited abrupt and sudden changes of posture, and interestingly, all three mice displayed what we interpreted as narcoleptic episodes with complete falls onto the side (4 to 5 falls per mouse, group median=4) (Fig. 4C). These episodes were followed by sudden bouts of locomotion, which typically were hyperactive compared with those in wild-type control mice.

We also evaluated the behavior of 12-week-old R6/2 mice during daytime, which mice normally largely spend sleeping. Interestingly, during the light phase of their diurnal cycle, R6/2 mice generally spent less time sleeping than wild-type mice, but they exhibited repeated, sudden episodes of behavioral arrest, sometimes associated with an abrupt change of posture.

This is also true for the R6/2 mouse, which has been reported to exhibit only minor cell loss in the neostriatum and the cerebral cortex (11,12), besides a loss of retinal cells (26). The paucity of intracerebral neuronal death in R6/2 mice suggests that the mouse model is a poor analogy to HD patients. Consequently, the clinical relevance of the R6/2 mouse has been questioned. Nevertheless, it is currently the most widely used mouse model in HD research and there are over 20 published reports testing novel therapies in this model (27).

Importantly, there was also a significant loss and atrophy of orexin-immunostained neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of HD patients, extending earlier reports of a loss of unidentified neurons in this structure in HD (7). In the small number of HD brains examined in our study, there was no obvious correlation between the Vonsattel grade and the loss of orexin neurons. The Vonsattel scale for neuropathological changes is based on cell loss in the striatum (28) and it is not a given that the degenerative changes in the hypothalamus follow a similar time course. Whether hypothalamic cell death, including orexin loss, occurs early in the human disease and whether it is correlated with motor, cognitive, sleep and weight loss symptoms, remain to be studied..

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	38	Why is there a loss of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons in HD and the R6/2 mouse model? Clearly, they are sensitive to the expression of an expanded polyglutamine protein, as mouse and rat models expressing an ataxin-3 construct with an increased number of CAG repeats, under the control of the orexin promoter, exhibited adult onset degeneration of the hypothalamic orexin neurons (21,30). Possibly, the expanded polyglutamine stretches disturb functions of crucial interacting proteins. Thus, huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP-1), a partner for huntingtin with unknown function, is enriched in the hypothalamus and null mutant mice for HAP-1 die early owing to impaired feeding and exhibit hypothalamic degeneration (31). In the same study, a transgenic mouse model expressing the first 171 amino acids of huntingtin with 82 glutamines (N171 to 82Q mice) also showed HAP-1 depletion and degeneration of neurons in the hypothalamus. Although the transmitter identity of the dying neurons in these models was not established, the degenerative phenomena included the lateral hypothalamus. Another explanation for the selective vulnerability of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons may be related to their expression of NMDA receptors. Recently, it was shown that exposure of rat hypothalamic cultures to excitotoxicity resulted in a specific loss of orexin neurons (15). Excitotoxicity has been widely regarded as a likely contributor to cell death in HD (1,14). There is evidence for functional changes in glutamatergic pathways in the R6/2 mice at several levels: from release, transmitter inactivation and receptor composition, to intracellular signaling in neurons receiving glutamatergic input (32 to 37). Despite this, there is little cell death in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Possibly, the striatal neurons gradually develop resistance to damage due to protracted low-grade excitotoxic stress (38). The resistance to acute excitotoxic damage is correlated to the number of neurons exhibiting intranuclear inclusions in the R6/2 striatum (35) and this proportion is generally lower in the lateral hypothalamus (57% in this study) compared with the striatum ( > 95%) (39)..

Despite this, there is little cell death in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Possibly, the striatal neurons gradually develop resistance to damage due to protracted low-grade excitotoxic stress (38). The resistance to acute excitotoxic damage is correlated to the number of neurons exhibiting intranuclear inclusions in the R6/2 striatum (35) and this proportion is generally lower in the lateral hypothalamus (57% in this study) compared with the striatum ( > 95%) (39)..

Characterization of the death of orexin neurons may shed light on the cellular events leading to neuronal death in HD. In addition, monitoring the loss of orexin-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus may also be an important index to measure therapeutic efficacy of novel drugs in R6/2 mice. Changes in sleep behavior and the occurrence of narcoleptic episodes constitute a functional outcome parameter to follow. Although no studies showing that the HD patients actually suffer from symptoms similar to narcolepsy have been reported so far, sleep patterns are disturbed (40). Indeed, HD patients have an abnormal sleep/wake cycle, and R6/2 mice exhibit a progressive disruption of circadian rhythms caused by dysregulation of circadian rhythm genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus (J. Morton, personal communication). Importantly, we have found that orexin fibers are lost in the R6/2 pineal region, which is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm via connections with the suprachiasmatic nucleus..

As plasma or CSF measurements of substances secreted from sites of neuropathology such as the hypothalamus are feasible, the identification of an affected neuronal subpopulation opens up new possibilities to identify such a marker. In end-stage R6/2 mice, both the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the levels of orexin in the CSF were reduced by 72% compared with wild-type littermates. This suggests that orexin could be used as a biomarker reflecting hypothalamic neurodegeneration. Considering the substantial loss and atrophy of orexin also in the human condition, we hypothesize that symptomatic HD patients have reduced CSF orexin levels below the levels considered diagnostic for narcolepsy. In healthy individuals, the normal orexin values in CSF are  > 200 pg/ml. Orexin levels  < 110 pg/ml are diagnostic for narcolepsy (41). Can one predict a similar decrease in HD patients? Our study shows that HD patients of Vonsattel grade II to III with around 43 CAG repeats (i.e. mild to moderate cases), have completely lost 30% of the orexin neurons. The remaining 70% neurons have undergone an atrophy of the neuronal cross-sectional area by 40% (representing an even greater percentage loss in the volume of each cell), which taken together suggest a reduction in total cell volume (both atrophy and cell death considered) that would lead to a reduction in CSF levels of orexin below the diagnostic levels for narcolepsy. Considering this scenario, CSF orexin levels could constitute a novel biomarker to assess disease progression and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in HD. Currently, such a biomarker is lacking in HD..

The density of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus was assessed in the three sections with the largest number of orexin-immunopositive neurons per mouse at all ages (n=4 to 9 per genotype per age). The outer borders of the areas with orexin-immunopositive neurons were first delineated and the area was assessed with the Olympus CAST-Grid system. Using a systematic random sampling technique, the number of profiles was assessed in 25% of the areas. The same technique was used in all mice. Profiles characterized by intense dark staining throughout the cell body were counted and included independently of the size or shape of their soma as some cells were atrophied (see Results). The average density of orexin-positive neurons in the three sections for each mouse was used in the statistical analysis. The cross-sectional soma area of orexin neurons was assessed in 30 randomly selected orexin-immunopositive neurons in the three sections from four mice per genotype and age using the Olympus CAST-Grid system. In the same areas, the total number of cells, neurons and EM48-positive neurons were analyzed in 12.5-week-old mice.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether the HCRT-producing circuit is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis in primates as well. We studied female monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) that were either fed or fasted for 24 h. Immunocytochemistry revealed HCRT-producing perikarya exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus-perifornical region and dorsomedial hypothalamus of the monkey brain. HCRT axons and axon terminals were present in different parts of the hypothalamus and adjacent forebrain and thalamic nuclei. The 24-h fast resulted in an approximately 50% decline in circulating leptin levels and significantly elevated c-fos expression in the perifornical region; in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and arcuate nuclei; and in the medial preoptic area. In the dorsomedial nucleus and perifornical region of fasted monkeys, three times more HCRT-neurons expressed nuclear c-fos than those of the normally fed controls. Neurons in different parts of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain that expressed c-fos, but did not contain HCRT, were targets of HCRT-immunopositive boutons establishing asymmetric synapses. In the arcuate nucleus, subsets of these HCRT-targeted c-fos-expressing cells contained neuropeptide Y. The present study provides the first experimental evidence to implicate HCRT in the hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis in primates. The fact that these lateral hypothalamic cells have leptin receptors and can be activated by a metabolic challenge and that they innervate diverse brain regions indicates that the HCRT system may be a key integrator of environmental cues in their regulation of diverse brain activity..

To ensure that matching sections were coprocessed, sections were selected using the comparative assessment of the location of the following anatomical landmarks: optic chiasm or tract, shape of the third ventricle, anterior commissure, fornix, mammilo-thalamic tract, and median eminence. One group of sections (either the control or the experimental) was marked by placing a notch on one side of the tissue block before vibratome sectioning. The analyzer was blind to the code, which was revealed after the collection of the counts. When the immunostaining was completed (three sets of coincubations from six monkeys three control and three experimental), matching sections were placed on slides, coverslipped, and analyzed using light microscopy. The number of c-fos-immunolabeled cells, those that were labeled for HCRT, and those that were labeled for both antigens were noted in several nuclei of the hypothalamus (see below). Only those cells on the surface of the section were counted.

Synaptic membrane specializations between HCRT boutons and c-fos-expressing cells were asymmetrical contacts (Fig. 3, B and C).

Whether this ARC NPY system may participate in the modulation of HCRT on food intake in primates, as suggested in the rat (13, 14), remains to be tested. The present observation of HCRT input to fasting-activated NPY cells in the African green monkey lends support to this possibility. Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that the activation of HCRT neurons by fasting occurs secondary to the activation of the ARC. However, ARC NPY cells are most likely protected by the blood-brain barrier, and the direct projection from the ARC to the lateral hypothalamus is not robust in the nonhuman primate (4). It may also be plausible that, because of the HCRT system is heavily involved with the regulation of sleep/wake cycles, it is disturbance of sleep during fasting that affects HCRT neuronal function. Alternatively, should metabolic signals affect HCRT cells during fasting, sleep disturbances may be the consequence HCRT neuronal activation..

In the central nervous system, the cell bodies producing orexins are localized in a narrow region within the lateral hypothalamus and project mainly to regions involved in feeding, sleep, and autonomic functions. Via putative pre- and postsynaptic effects, orexins increase synaptic activity in these regions. In isolated neurons and cells expressing recombinant receptors orexins cause Ca2+ elevation, which is mainly dependent on influx. The activity of orexinergic cells appears to be controlled by feeding- and sleep-related signals via a variety of neurotransmitters/hormones from the brain and other tissues. Orexins and orexin receptors are also found outside the central nervous system, particularly in organs involved in feeding and energy metabolism, e.g., gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adrenal gland.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	8	OUR KNOWLEDGE of the orexinergic system was initiated in 1998 by two independent groups and approaches (reviewed in Refs. 26, 157). In January 1998, the group of Sutcliffe published a study (37) in which they predicted that a particular rat hypothalamic mRNA species ("clone 35"; Ref. 50) would code for a precursor peptide 130 amino acids (aa) in length, each molecule of which would generate two separate peptides of 39- and 29-aa lengths. The peptides were named hypocretins, on the basis of their hypothalamic localization and their proposed sequence similarity to the secretin family of peptides; however, only orexin B bears any significant resemblance to secretin. The precursor peptide would thus be preprohypocretin and the two final peptides hypocretin (hcrt)-1 and hcrt-2. Simultaneously with the work of the group of Sutcliffe, the group of Yanagisawa (154) isolated a hypothalamic 33-aa peptide that activated the orphan receptor HFGAN72. This receptor was found also to respond to another peptide, 28 aa in length. A second receptor was cloned on the basis of its sequence similarity to HFGAN72, and this receptor also responded to both isolated peptides with Ca2+ elevation. On the basis of the peptide sequences, Sakurai and coworkers (154) cloned the cDNA for the precursor peptide (130 aa in the rat). The peptides were named orexins, because they increased food intake in nonfasted rats when injected into the lateral ventricle. The precursor peptide thus became preproorexin, the 33- and 28-aa final peptides orexin A and orexin B, respectively, and the receptors OX1 and OX2 receptors. Both preprohypocretin and preproorexin were found preferentially in the rat brain and more specifically in the hypothalamus (37, 154). Cellular and systemic responses to the peptides were observed in the rat. Application of hcrt-2 increased postsynaptic current frequency in rat hypothalamic neurons in culture (37), and orexin A and -B increased food intake in nonfasted rats (154)..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	9	It soon became clear that the peptides isolated by the two groups were, in principle, identical. However, there was an error in the peptide sequences deduced by de Lecea and coworkers (37), so that most authors refer to the accepted sequences by Sakurai et al. (154) and not to de Lecea et al. (37) even when they are using the hypocretin nomenclature. Therefore, the current praxis makes preproorexin = preprohypocretin, orexin A = hcrt-1, orexin B = hcrt-2, OX1 receptor = hcrtr-1, and OX2 receptor = hcrtr-2. There is an ongoing argument concerning which nomenclature should be used. To avoid confusion with the sequences we use the orexin nomenclature throughout this review..

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	11	Today there is a wealth of information concerning the anatomic architecture of the orexinergic system as well as the systemic effects of orexins. The most prominent and well-demonstrated effect of orexins is undoubtedly regulation of sleep/wakefulness (reviewed in Refs. 74, 172, 190). Although many other responses have been shown, their physiological significance is less clear. Effects on feeding behavior have been demonstrated in a multitude of studies, but the results are somewhat contradictory. The current view is that orexins may rather regulate short-term appetite, energy metabolism, and feeding-associated processes (e.g., gastrointestinal functions, mastication). Orexins also affect hormonal secretion, the most well-demonstrated effects being those on the hormones involved in the stress response and energy metabolism such as glucocorticoids and norepinephrine. At the same time, information concerning the regulatory mechanisms of orexinergic systems and their targets on a cellular level is lagging behind. In this review, we try to create a comprehensive picture of orexins and their proven and putative physiological role. The main emphasis is placed on functional properties and interactions between the orexin-producing and orexin-responding cells..

The 3.2-kb promoter region of the preproorexin gene seems to be enough to direct expression of the downstream gene to the lateral hypothalamus in the mouse (155). This has been utilized to cause selective depletion of orexinergic neurons in transgenic mice expressing preproorexin-ataxin-3 fusion protein (60). In these mice, orexinergic neurons are progressively lost postnatally. For transcription, the most essential part has been suggested to be the 450 bp most proximal to the gene (185)..

Mammalian orexin A in rat is a 33-aa peptide with two intrachain disulfide bridges, and orexin B is a 28-aa linear peptide (Fig. 1A). There is a substantial sequence identity in the COOH termini of these peptides. In addition, orexin B and secretin contain an identical stretch of seven amino acids. Orexin A and -B are likely to be COOH-terminally amidated, and the NH2-terminal glutamine residue of orexin A may be modified to a pyroglutamoyl residue (154); however, the posttranslational modifications have been experimentally verified only in the rat. Orexin A in human, pig, dog, rat, and mouse are identical (Fig. 1B), whereas orexin B in pig and dog differs by one amino acid and orexin B in rat and mouse by two amino acids from human orexin B (Fig. 1C). The three-dimensional structure of orexin A is not known, but orexin B has been determined to consist of two -helices at a 60-80 degrees  angle to each other (100)..

These receptors, called OX1 and OX2 receptors, form a subclass of their own under the class A G protein-coupled receptors (class A  peptide receptor  orexin and neuropeptide FF receptors  orexin receptors). Both receptors are rather "average" G protein-coupled receptors with modestly long NH2 and COOH termini and neither very long nor short i3 loops (Fig. 2). OX1 receptor (chromosome 1) is 425 aa long and OX2 receptor (chromosome 6) 444 aa long in humans, and there is an overall 64% sequence identity between them. In each gene, the identity of one amino acid is disputed based on a Entrez search (covering a variety of databases such as SwissProt) and a variety of published references: in OX1 receptor, aa 280 in the i3 loop is either Gly or Ala, and in OX2 receptor, aa 308 in the sixth transmembrane segment is either Val or Ile. Amino acids subject to these polymorphisms/mutations are also marked in Fig. 2 (see also Narcolepsy, a Disorder of the Orexinergic System). The gene transcript for each receptor is composed of a 5'-untranslated region, seven separate exons, each of which codes a part of the final protein, and six introns. High sequence identity [91-98%; comparison made with Blast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST)] is seen between the cloned mammalian species (human, pig, dog, rat, mouse) variants. Two neuropeptide FF receptors (14, 28) are most closely related to the orexin receptors, but the gross sequence identity is very low (31-35% for the human receptors), no longer stretches of high identity can be found, and identity of a nearly similar degree can be observed between neuropeptide FF receptor and, for instance, some neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors. Furthermore, orexin receptors are 28-31% identical to many other peptide receptors including NPY Y2, thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone (TRH), and NK2 tachykinin receptors. Therefore, grouping of orexin and neuropeptide FF receptors in the same family is questionable..

Because orexin receptors caused Ca2+ elevations of high magnitude in this cell line devoid of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, they were thought to couple to the phospholipase C-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-Ca2+ release cascade via the Gq family of G proteins. The orexins were subsequently shown to elevate intracellular Ca2+ in neuronal cell cultures from hypothalamus and cortex (183, 184). The Ca2+ elevations in neurons were found to be independent of intracellular release and to require extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3). The requirement for extracellular Ca2+ is not a typical property of a Gq-mediated response, which consists of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by a "capacitative" Ca2+ entry to refill the stores. The observed Ca2+ elevation in neurons was blocked by a bisindoylmaleimide protein kinase C inhibitor. It was therefore suggested, that orexin receptors would activate protein kinase C, which would phosphorylate and thereby activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (183). Similar findings were described by Uramura et al. (181) in isolated rat ventral tegmental neurons. Orexin A was determined to elevate intracellular Ca2+ via activation of nitrendipine- and -conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The response was also sensitive to calphostin C (inhibitor of protein kinase C) and D609 (inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C), which suggested the following activation sequence: orexin receptor  phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C  protein kinase C  N-/L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels  influx of Ca2+. Ca2+ elevation has also been measured in cultured rat embryonic spinal cord neurons, although the source of Ca2+ has not been investigated (182). Indirect evidence in rat locus ceruleus and tuberomamillary nucleus also suggests activation of Ca2+ influx (44, 70)..

The data demonstrate the extracellular Ca2+ dependence of the orexin-stimulated Ca2+ response. Cells were stimulated with 1  microM rat hcrt-2 (H) in the presence of 1 mM or ~0 mM (0 Ca2+/EGTA) extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o), and intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored with fura 2 methodology. As shown, the response to hypocretin 2 was completely blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+. The experiment was performed in the continuous presence of 1  microM tetrodotoxin (TTX).

In neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx has been observed by fura 2 measurements (181, 182-184) and is also suggested by electrophysiological measurements (44, 70). Because orexins may depolarize neurons via block of K+ channels (see Depolarizing actions), some Ca2+ influx may even result from an indirect activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Extracellular Ca2+ dependence of the orexin-stimulated Ca2+ response in CHO cells expressing human OX1 receptors (CHO-hOX1). A: reduction of [Ca2+]o to 140 nM shifts the orexin A concentration-response curve 2 orders of magnitude to the right. B: orexin A-mediated Ca2+ response can be blocked by reducing the driving force for Ca2+ entry. A CHO-hOX1 cell was patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration to regulate its membrane potential, and therefore the driving force for Ca2+ entry, and Ca2+ transients were measured with fura 2. Gray boxes and black bars indicate presence of 10 nM orexin A in the bath. Under the light gray box, the cells were exposed to orexin A at the holding potential +60 mV, and under the dark gray box the cells were exposed to orexin A at the holding potential 50 or 40 mV. Inset: voltage application profile. Ca2+ response to orexin A is only seen at the negative holding potential, which indicates that Ca2+ influx is required for the response.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	38	Functional experiments indicate that in addition to Ca2+ release and activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels, there are several types of Ca2+ influx pathways activated by G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 7). Although in most cases the mechanisms have not been clarified, these pathways may be activated directly by G protein subunits or second messengers. These pathways may be identical or related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family (reviewed in Ref. 29). The TRP genes encode a family of over 20 proteins. Many of the TRP gene products form Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels, and some members of the TRP (super)family even have inherent protein kinase or ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase domains. TRP channels are widely expressed in mammalian cells, and they are activated after Gq-coupled receptor stimulation but the activation mechanisms are in many cases unknown. It will be interesting to see whether any of the TRP channels can be held responsible for the orexin receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	39	Methodological considerations. Characterization of receptor-mediated electrical responses in neuronal preparations is performed with some common electrophysiological techniques. In many situations in which intracellular recordings are difficult, extracellular electrodes can be more practical to use and they are likely to induce much less cellular damage. On the other hand, these response measurements are usually limited to the registration of action potential frequency. Measurements with intracellular electrodes (normal or microelectrodes) can be performed with feedback amplification allowing voltage or current clamp or in a "free-running" mode, in which case voltage changes are monitored. These latter methods, most importantly, offer better possibilities for investigation of the mechanisms underlying the electrical activity than the extracellular electrodes..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	40	Recordings from neurons are usually performed in slices or similar preparations, in which cells are synaptically coupled. The cell measured can thus be the target for upstream signals rather than responding directly to orexins themselves. The usual way of eliminating the secondary effects far upstream of the measured cell is to use tetrodotoxin (TTX). By blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels this hinders action potential propagation in most neurons. However, TTX will not, for instance, block direct effects of orexins on the presynaptic terminal most immediately upstream of the cell investigated. Therefore, TTX does not exclusively separate pre- and postsynaptic effects. Presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channelsand therefore transmitter releasecan be blocked with, for example, Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and more specific drugs or toxins. However, orexin receptors may activate Ca2+ channels not sensitive to these inhibitors (see Ca2+ Elevation). On the other hand, these blockers may also affect, for instance, orexin-activated Ca2+ channels other than the voltage-gated channels. This may lead to a block of both pre- and postsynaptic responses to orexin. As an example of this, Ni2+ blocks voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, some orexin-activated non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (96), and even the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (91). "Synaptic isolation" is performed by using medium with low extracellular Ca2+ ( > 0.3 mM) and high extracellular Mg2+ ( < 4 mM). This widely used method appears to block electrically evoked synaptic transmission, but the mechanistic basis for it is unclear. Similarly as above, it is unknown whether this method would affect orexin-mediated presynaptic responses if these were mediated by other than voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or by Ca2+ release. It is also difficult to preclude possible postsynaptic effects..

However, even in this case it is possible, although unlikely, that responses are mediated by some indirect messengers released from neighboring cells. Measurement of synaptic activity is a method often used for studies of receptor-coupled mechanisms. Increased/decreased frequency of excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC, respectively) by orexins suggests a stimulatory effect on transmitter release, i.e., a presynaptic effect. When the amplitude of a synaptic current is increased, it is difficult to conclude whether the response is pre- or postsynaptic..

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	44	Increased synaptic activity. The most common electrophysiological response to orexins appears to be increase in spontaneous or evoked action potential frequency, as observed with extracellular or intracellular electrodes. Increased action potential frequency has been measured in the hypothalamus [rat tuberomamillary nucleus, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive, -responsive, and -indifferent neurons (for definition, see Responses of orexinergic cells to feeding stimuli), arcuate nucleus, and paraventricular nucleus; Refs. 8, 42, 44, 103, 147, 159, 164, 165, 195], brain stem (rat locus ceruleus , substantia nigra pars reticulata, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus; Refs. 15, 19, 56, 70, 75, 93, 170), spinal cord (rat preganglionic sympathetic neurons of intermediolateral cell column of thoracic and lumbar cord; Ref. 3), and peripheral neurons (guinea pig ileal S-type submucosal neurons; Ref. 92). In contrast, orexin A suppresses the firing rate of glucose-responsive neurons in rat ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, antagonizing the effect of glucose (164). Action potentials and their enhancement with orexins are blocked by TTX (3, 44, 54, 70, 75, 165, 170, 195) but usually not by synaptic isolation with low Ca2+-high Mg2+ (8, 42, 93, 147) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channel block with Cd2+ (170). The latter data therefore suggest that orexins would directly affect the postsynaptic neurons at some sites, with reservations for the methodological shortcomings (see above). It should also be noted that the putative presynaptic block has only been applied in a minority of studies. Interestingly, a TTX-insensitive response is observed in rat locus ceruleus. Hypocretin 2 (orexin B) depolarizes and increases spontaneous firing frequency in locus ceruleus slices (70). In the presence of TTX these spontaneous spikes vanish, but orexin B still causes a small depolarization (3.4 mV) and electrical discharges, although these spikes are slower than the spontaneous spikes. These spikes may be caused by Ca2+ channels or TTX-insensitive Na+ channels..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	45	More detailed analysis of individual synaptic currents shows enhancement of synaptic activity by orexins as an increase in spontaneous or evoked EPSC (rat hypothalamus, rat superficial dorsal horn, and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus; Refs. 19, 37, 49, 54, 183, 184) and IPSC (rat hypothalamic and superficial dorsal horn neurons; Refs. 49, 54, 183) frequency. EPSCs and IPSCs are blocked by TTX in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19, 54) but not in rat hypothalamus (49, 183). Therefore, the orexin receptor mediating these putative presynaptic responses may lie farther upstream in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In both of these sites, depolarization mediated by orexins persists in the presence of TTX, suggesting that orexin receptors are expressed both on the cell investigated and on some upstream neuron. In some cases, the released transmitters causing the postsynaptic currents have been investigated with receptor blockers. In mouse laterodorsal tegmental neurons, the orexin-mediated elevation in the EPSC frequency is attenuated by ionotropic glutamate receptor block, whereas the (postsynaptic) depolarization response is not affected (19). In rat embryonic hypothalamic neurons in culture, hypocretin 2 (orexin B) increases IPSC and EPSC frequency in a TTX-insensitive manner (49, 183). The former is blocked by GABAA receptor block and the latter by ionotropic glutamate receptor block. In rat superficial dorsal horn neurons, orexin B-mediated increase in IPSC frequency is inhibited by glycine receptor block (54). Amplitudes of the postsynaptic currents or potentials are also sometimes affected, as reported for guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia [reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitude; Ref. 92], mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (increased EPSC amplitude; Ref. 19), and rat arcuate nucleus (increased IPSP amplitude; Ref. 183). Increased amplitude of postsynaptic potentials or currents does not specify a pre- or postsynaptic mechanism in these cases..

This depolarization also results, when investigated, without exception in increased action potential frequency, and often the depolarization has been studied in the presence of TTX to block this "disturbance" (Fig. 5, A and B). Depolarizations of a maximum magnitude of 3-10 mV have been observedmainly with free-running electrodesin the hypothalamus (rat tuberomamillary nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive neurons; Refs. 8, 44, 103, 159, 165), in the brain stem (rat locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus; Refs. 56, 70, 75, 80, 170), in the spinal cord (rat intermediolateral cell column; Ref. 3), and in the periphery (guinea pig ileal S-type submucosal neurons; Ref. 92). Inward currents have been observed in rat locus ceruleus (150 pA; Ref. 170), dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (30 pA; Ref. 75), and superficial dorsal horn (35 pA; Ref. 54) and in mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (20 pA; Ref. 19)..

Evidence for this includes the stable currents and lack of effect of TTX, "synaptic block," or other kinds of elimination of EPSCs. What then is the mechanism of this depolarization? In rat lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive neurons, locus ceruleus, autonomic preganglionic neurons of intermediolateral cell column, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and in guinea pig ileal S-type submucosal neurons, increased input resistance (by 2-85%) has been measured to co-occur with the depolarization (3, 75, 80, 92, 103). This suggests that orexins may inhibit K+ channels, which is also suggested by the reduced afterhyperpolarization amplitude observed in rat locus ceruleus and in guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia (70, 92). Also, the current-voltage relationship, when measured, suggests K+ channel inhibition (rat locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus; Refs. 75, 80). On the other hand, orexins may activate Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, as suggested in mouse peritoneal macrophages (76). It is interesting that orexins instead inhibit the slow afterhyperpolarization in locus ceruleus, which is thought to depend on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. It is possible that orexins do not elevate Ca2+ at all sites or that other signals generated by the receptor activation counteract the effect of Ca2+ elevation..

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	51	In other cases, reduced input resistance or noise is associated with the orexin-induced depolarization. This has been seen in rat tuberomamillary nucleus (44), rat lumbar spinal cord (54), and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19). In hypothalamic histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B both depolarize and increase the firing rate (8, 44, 195) (Fig. 5, A and B). This depolarization is abolished by removal of extracellular Na+ and virtually unaffected by an increase in extracellular K+ (44). Pharmacological block of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger reduces the depolarization, suggesting that it may be mediated by Ca2+ elevation-induced activation of electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The residual depolarization is blocked by Ni2+, which may suggest that the putatively underlying Ca2+ current can also slightly depolarize the cells itself. Even in rat dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, a part of the current appears to depend on Na+ and the remaining part may be caused by K+ channel block (75)..

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	55	Summary of orexin effects on electrical activity of neurons. Thus orexins most often increase neuronal activity via presynaptic effects (increased transmitter release via unknown mechanisms) and via postsynaptic depolarization (block of K+ channels, activation of cation channels and electrogenic transporters?). Some of the effects such as the putative K+ channel inhibition are typical for Gq-coupled receptors (see, e.g., Refs. 59, 65, 112, 187). Other mechanisms may be secondary to the Ca2+ elevation or may depend on the activation of nonselective cation channels like the TRP channels. On particular neurons, orexins may also cause inhibition via increased inhibitory transmitter release or via decreased postsynaptic effects of excitatory transmitters. It is unclear which direct or indirect roles Ca2+ transients play in electrical responses to orexins, and not much effort has been put into investigation of this to date. Independent of the method of measurement of electrical activity, the effects of orexins usually have a slow onset of action (10 s-4 min) and the recovery is even slower (see, e.g., Refs. 3, 9, 19, 44, 54, 75, 93, 103, 159, 165, 195). Most studies have been performed with slices, a preparation in which perfusion of orexins in and out may be slow. However, because rather superficial neurons are patched, there is no obvious reason why the perfusate would not reach the neurons immediately. Furthermore, similar slow onset (10- to 20-s lag, 1 min to maximum) and delayed offset ( > 2 min to complete decay after removal) are seen in dissociated neurons (195). Therefore, it is possible that orexins affect ion channels via, e.g., phosphorylation rather than direct G protein interaction. Some results indicate involvement of protein kinase A and -C in orexin responses (93, 181, 183). Orexin B has been reported to reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current amplitude by 19% and to enhance GABA-induced current amplitude by 48% in dissociated rat nucleus accumbens cells (113); this could also possibly be a phosphorylation-dependent event..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	56	Summary of orexin effects on electrical activity of neurons. Thus orexins most often increase neuronal activity via presynaptic effects (increased transmitter release via unknown mechanisms) and via postsynaptic depolarization (block of K+ channels, activation of cation channels and electrogenic transporters?). Some of the effects such as the putative K+ channel inhibition are typical for Gq-coupled receptors (see, e.g., Refs. 59, 65, 112, 187). Other mechanisms may be secondary to the Ca2+ elevation or may depend on the activation of nonselective cation channels like the TRP channels. On particular neurons, orexins may also cause inhibition via increased inhibitory transmitter release or via decreased postsynaptic effects of excitatory transmitters. It is unclear which direct or indirect roles Ca2+ transients play in electrical responses to orexins, and not much effort has been put into investigation of this to date. Independent of the method of measurement of electrical activity, the effects of orexins usually have a slow onset of action (10 s-4 min) and the recovery is even slower (see, e.g., Refs. 3, 9, 19, 44, 54, 75, 93, 103, 159, 165, 195).

These are the most direct indications of presynaptic effects of orexins, and in the presence of TTX, rather certainly suggest a presynaptic site for orexin effects. Inhibition of K+-stimulated serotonin release by orexin A and -B from rat hypothalamic synaptosomes also directly shows a presynaptic site of action (140). There are also indirect indications of orexin-stimulated transmitter release from in vitro slice (norepinephrine from rat cerebral cortex; Ref. 66) or in vivo microdialysis (histamine from rat anterior hypothalamus; Ref. 79) studies. In these cases, it is impossible to tell whether orexins directly affect the releasing neurons or some upstream neurons; some complex mechanism is suggested by the delayed (by 6 min) response in rat cerebrocortical slices..

In contrast, in primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurons, no elevation of cAMP is seen (183). Elevation of cAMP may occur by several mechanisms depending on the isoform of adenylyl cyclase expressed. Adenylyl cyclase isoforms are differentially activated by Ca2+, protein kinase C, and G protein -subunits (171), and the expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms may be different in the adrenal cortex and the hypothalamus. G proteins might also be expressed tissue-specifically, and OX1 and OX2 receptors could couple to different G proteins.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	64	OX1 and OX2 receptors were already shown in the original study to have different binding affinities for orexin A and -B (154). When expressed recombinantly in CHO cells, OX1 receptor has 10 times higher affinity for orexin A than for orexin B whereas OX2 receptor binds orexin A and -B with equal affinity. The same selectivity is seen with respect to Ca2+ elevation; thus orexin A activates OX1 receptors up to 10 times more potently than orexin B (138, 154, 168). Thus the evidence for selectivity of OX1 receptor and nonselectivity of OX2 receptor between orexin A and -B is based solely on the studies on Ca2+ elevation in recombinant CHO cells. It is difficult to find exclusive expression of one subtype in any tissue, but in some cases support for this selectivity can be found: orexin A is 5.5-fold more potent in increasing electrical activity of rat locus ceruleus, where OX1 expression dominates (170). In isolated human adrenocortical cells, where OX1 mRNA is also predominantly found, orexin A but not orexin B stimulates cortisol secretion (117). In tissues where OX2 expression dominates, such as rat tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B are essentially equipotent in stimulating the electrical activity. Orexin A and -B are also equally potent in releasing catecholamines from human pheochromocytoma cells, which only express OX2 mRNA (116). On the other hand, the putatively OX2-mediated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release is 10-fold less sensitive to orexin B than to orexin A (13, 158). It is generally dangerous to rely on so-called selective agonists, because their efficacies can be very dependent on receptor and G protein expression levels. For these pharmacological reasons and because of the chemical differences between orexin A and -B (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), conclusions on receptor subtype involvement based on potency of orexin variants (42, 113, 138, 158) should probably be avoided. Some studies report higher potency of orexin B than orexin A with respect to some responses (76, 85), which is unexplainable on the basis of recombinant pharmacology. Even if any pharmacological selectivity with respect to the interaction of orexin A and -B with the orexin receptor subtypes was to occur in the tissues, its physiological significance would be unclear..

Comparison of structures and activities of orexin A and -B suggests that the NH2-terminal amino acids are less important for receptor binding and activation than the COOH-terminal amino acids (33). Truncation of orexin A to orexin A15-33 reduces its potency for both OX1 and OX2 receptors 20- to 60-fold (33, 138), and further truncation successively abolishes the Ca2+ response, at least for OX1 (33). Mutation of cystine-forming cysteines to alanines in orexin A reduces the potency of the mutant peptides for both OX1 and OX2 receptors ~10-fold (138). However, it is difficult to judge whether this effect is due to the lost disulfide bridges or the exchanged cysteines themselves. One-by-one replacement of each amino acid in orexin-A15-33 with alanine (alanine scan) has revealed regions of particular importance for orexin A activation of the OX1 receptor, in particular leucines 19 and 20 and the most COOH-terminal aa 26-33 seem to be of great importance (33). Recently, we observed (S. Ammoun, T. Holmqvist, R. Shariatmadari, R. Oonk, M. Detheux, M. Parmentier, K. E. O. Akerman, and J. P. Kukkonen, unpublished observations) that OX1 and OX2 receptors are approximately equally sensitive to NH2-terminal truncation and alanine scan of the orexin peptides. The amino acids of importance are largely the same as those described in Ref. 33. Change/removal of these amino acids affects both OX1 and OX2 receptors, but some interesting differences are seen in the potency of the response. Interestingly, none of the mutated peptides without activity are antagonists..

Most of the studies have not specified whether the expression is seen on neurons or other cells, although electrophysiological and other measurements, whenever performed, indicate activation of neurons. Levels of orexin receptors can but do not necessarily fully follow the density of orexinergic innervation. Only in a few cases have synaptic contacts been anatomically shown (48, 55, 70, 195).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	101	Similar amounts of OX1 and OX2 mRNA are found in the rat brain as a whole, and OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNAs mostly show similar distribution, although some differences are seen (Fig. 7). Most interesting are the areas in which essentially only one subtype is expressed (111, 180). However, mRNA expression may not directly correspond to receptor protein expression, as discussed by van den Pol et al. (184). The correlation of receptor distribution with different functions of the orexinergic system is shown in Table 3. While this article was under review, studies on the expression of OX1 and OX2 receptor protein in the rat CNS were published (30, 64). A particularly interesting finding is the expression of OX2 receptor protein in the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum (30); earlier studies had failed to detect any orexin receptors or their mRNA in the cerebellum although orexinergic fibers were projecting to the cerebellum. Otherwise, the immunohistochemical studies suggest a distribution generally similar to that from the mRNA measurements, although some differences are seen. For instance, greater overlap of the expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors is suggested on the basis of immunological studies than of in situ hybridization. As discussed by the authors, these differences may in some degree be related to the fact that mRNA measurements visualize the expressing cell bodies whereas immunohistochemistry indicates the actual cellular localization of the protein. Both receptor mRNA and protein measurements are semiquantitative rather than quantitative so they do not allow absolute comparison of subtype expression within any site..

The results are, however, contradictory, and if any conclusion can be drawn, it is that leptin is not necessarily required to keep orexin expression low.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	128	In the original publication dealing with orexins, it was shown that intracerebroventricular injection of orexins induces feeding in rats (154). When injected into different hypothalamic sites in the rat, orexin A is effective only in a narrow area (perifornical area, lateral hypothalamus, and dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei but not in preoptic area or arcuate or ventromedial nucleus) whereas orexin B is inactive (39, 173). Some of the hypothalamic nuclei possibly involved in feeding responses to orexins are listed in Table 3. Intraperitoneally injected OX1 receptor antagonist (SB-334867) inhibits baseline feeding, normal weight gain, and the feeding response to orexin injection in the hypothalamus (62, 150). The feeding-stimulating effect of fasting is blocked by intracisternally administered anti-orexin A antibodies (192) and intraperitoneal SB-334867 (62). This suggests that at least the OX1 receptor is involved in the natural regulation of feeding, but both orexin receptor subtypes are expressed in the nuclei involved in the regulation of feeding (Refs. 111, 180; Table 3). Orexin A increases c-fos expression in areas of energy regulatory sites within the hypothalamus, the limbic region, and the hindbrain (128). As mentioned above (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS), orexins belong to a regulatory network of peptides, including NPY, MCH, AGRP, galanin, POMC products, CART, and dynorphin, which regulate feeding behavior. Orexins appear to act upstream of NPY as antagonists to the NPY Y1 or Y5 receptors block orexin-stimulated feeding (38, 81)..

When injected into different hypothalamic sites in the rat, orexin A is effective only in a narrow area (perifornical area, lateral hypothalamus, and dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei but not in preoptic area or arcuate or ventromedial nucleus) whereas orexin B is inactive (39, 173). Some of the hypothalamic nuclei possibly involved in feeding responses to orexins are listed in Table 3. Intraperitoneally injected OX1 receptor antagonist (SB-334867) inhibits baseline feeding, normal weight gain, and the feeding response to orexin injection in the hypothalamus (62, 150). The feeding-stimulating effect of fasting is blocked by intracisternally administered anti-orexin A antibodies (192) and intraperitoneal SB-334867 (62). This suggests that at least the OX1 receptor is involved in the natural regulation of feeding, but both orexin receptor subtypes are expressed in the nuclei involved in the regulation of feeding (Refs. 111, 180; Table 3). Orexin A increases c-fos expression in areas of energy regulatory sites within the hypothalamus, the limbic region, and the hindbrain (128). As mentioned above (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS), orexins belong to a regulatory network of peptides, including NPY, MCH, AGRP, galanin, POMC products, CART, and dynorphin, which regulate feeding behavior. Orexins appear to act upstream of NPY as antagonists to the NPY Y1 or Y5 receptors block orexin-stimulated feeding (38, 81)..
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	130	The degree to which orexins regulate long-term food intake is subject to debate; some data indicate rather that orexin-induced food intake is only an acute effect and is evened out by compensatory decrease in food intake within 24 h (see, e.g., Refs. 38, 63, 194). It can be speculated that part of orexin-induced food intake is secondary to increased wakefulness and activity and therefore following increased energy expenditure. A general view emerging from the different results is that orexins may participate in the short-term regulation of energy homeostasis by initiating feeding in response to falls in glucose, but the subsequent increase in glucose, leptin, and visceral signals would decrease orexin, which in its turn would terminate the behavior after food ingestion (Refs. 22, 53; reviewed in Refs. 189, 190). Mapping of orexinergic projections indicates that orexins could also be involved in the overall regulation of feeding. For instance, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nucleus, and lamina 1 and 10 of the sacral cord receive afferents from the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, motor trigeminal nucleus, intermediolateral cell column, and sacral parasympathetic nucleus give rise to nerves that innervate the gastrointestinal tract and muscles of mastication (31, 34, 36, 131, 143, 182, 198). Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that central orexinergic nerves could be involved in the primary eating process via sensory and motor innervation of the mouth and in the passage of food through the gastrointestinal tract via sensory, motor, and secretomotor innervation of the intestines. Peripheral orexinergic neurons and endocrine release of orexins from, e.g., enterochromaffin cells could affect intestinal motility, endo- and exocrine secretion, uptake, and sensory signaling in the gastrointestinal tract (see Effects of orexins on gastrointestinal tract and other organs of feeding/energy metabolism). Some direct data (6, 106, 124, 175, 186, 197) and indirect observations from narcoleptic patients and animal models (23, 60, 162, 193) suggest that orexins may affect metabolic rate or heat loss or related processes. An overall role in energy metabolism is also suggested by the effects of orexins on the release of hormones, especially adrenal steroids (see Orexins in Autonomic/Endocrine Functions)..

In addition, hypersomnia is often observed. Narcolepsy in humans is usually a sporadic disease; its strong association with some major histocompatibility complex antigens (especially HLA-DRB1*15, HLA-DQA1*0102, and HLA-DQB1*0602) has for a long time been suggested to relate it to some autoimmune process. Yet autoantibodies or signs of ongoing or previous inflammation have been hard to find (reviewed in Refs. 74, 94, 102, 141, 179). This could, however, be caused 1) by the fact that postmortem narcoleptic brains are usually investigated years after disease onset and 2) by the dispersed nature of the orexinergic cells. Orexin A is undetectable in the CSF of most human narcoleptic patients (32, 135), the number of orexinergic neurons in postmortem narcoleptic brains is much reduced (142, 178), and even signs of gliosis have been observed (178). At the same time MCHergic neurons, at the same brain areas, are present in normal numbers (142, 178). This, together with the animal model systems (see below), has led to the hypothesis of narcolepsy as a disease of orexinergic neurons. As further support for this, only one clearly debilitating preproorexin or orexin receptor mutation has been found in human subjects (Ref. 142; see below)..

Orexin A is undetectable in the CSF of most human narcoleptic patients (32, 135), the number of orexinergic neurons in postmortem narcoleptic brains is much reduced (142, 178), and even signs of gliosis have been observed (178). At the same time MCHergic neurons, at the same brain areas, are present in normal numbers (142, 178). This, together with the animal model systems (see below), has led to the hypothesis of narcolepsy as a disease of orexinergic neurons. As further support for this, only one clearly debilitating preproorexin or orexin receptor mutation has been found in human subjects (Ref. 142; see below)..

This has been accomplished by genetic disruption of the preproorexin gene (orexin knockout mouse; Ref. 23), genetic destruction of orexinergic cells in preproorexin-ataxin-3 knockin mouse (60), and toxic destruction of orexinergic cells by hypothalamic injection of orexin B-saporin conjugate (52)..

Recently, familial canine narcolepsy of Doberman pinschers and Labrador retrievers was shown to be caused by mutations in the OX2 receptor gene (102). In both cases, the mutations cause premature amino acid chain termination. When expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells, the mutant receptors mainly remain in the intracellular compartments and neither bind orexin A nor activate Ca2+ mobilization (73). Point mutation Glu54Lys at the NH2 terminus/first transmembrane segment junction of the OX2 receptor also leads to reduced orexin A binding and 400-fold reduced potency for Ca2+ elevation when expressed in HEK293 cells (73). The 10 other reported mutations in preproorexin or OX2 receptor genes are thought to represent benign polymorphisms (73). Sporadic cases of canine narcolepsy have been suggested to be caused by lack of orexins (148)..

One other polymorphism concerns the reported sequence for the OX1 receptors (aa 280; see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), although this could be a sequencing error. One mutation, Leu16Arg, found in the 5'-signal peptide region of the human preproorexin gene probably results in early-onset, severe narcolepsy (142). When transiently expressed in Neuro-2A cells, the mutated peptide apparently accumulated in some tubular network, presumably smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in contrast to the wild-type preproorexin, which appeared in vesicles. Another point mutation in the 5'-untranslated region may be involved in disease process in the presence of a particular type of tissue antigen (HLA-DR2; Ref. 51). Insertion of an adenosine at 593 (promoter region) has been found in one narcoleptic patient, although the effect of this on pathogenicity is unclear (51)..

OX2 receptor appears to be especially involved in the dog, which would promote the role of nuclei relying on this receptor subtype, such as tuberomamillary nucleus, although it is possible that OX1 and OX2 receptors have different distributions in rats and humans compared with dogs..

Patients with narcolepsy show somewhat increased body mass index compared with healthy subjects (162). Both of the two previously described kinds of orexin-transgenic mice are hypophagic, but preproorexin knockout mice are lean (23) as opposed to orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which are obese (60). It is thus possible that preproorexin knockout mice develop some compensatory mechanisms for weight regulation whereas orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which lose their orexinergic neurons postnatally (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), will not be able to do this. Another interesting possibility was recently proposed by Chou et al. (27). Essentially all the mouse lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons express dynorphin (10, 27), removal of which in orexinergic neuron-deficient mice might be responsible for the more pronounced phenotype..

What are the mechanisms of action of orexins at the cellular level? Have all orexin receptors been identified? Are there presynaptic inhibitory orexin receptors in the brain? The limited access to orexin-responding neurons is an experimental problem. There are several limitations concerning the methods available for the characterization of the functional properties of these cells in slice preparations or acutely isolated cells. Model systems based on cultured neurons or even neuronal stem cells might provide an important improvement for studies of orexin signaling. The CHO cell lines available have provided insight in functions of the orexinergic system and have enabled screening for orexin receptor ligands, but all the data obtained may not be relevant for the nervous system. Recombinant models based on neurons or neuronlike cells might therefore provide further information about the signal pathways used by orexins..

Available information suggests that at least one population of the orexinergic cells in the lateral hypothalamus directly monitors and responds to changes in glucose concentration in their environment and may also directly respond to signals inhibiting feeding such as leptin. Are these orexinergic cells the ones that project to areas in brain involved in feeding behavior? Orexin receptors are expressed in high numbers in several regions within the hypothalamus. Do these regulate the release of other feeding-related neurotransmitters? The regulation of feeding seems to be complex, involving many other neuropeptides, and there seems to be a gross redundancy in the system. Blocking of the orexinergic system by various means will reduce feeding, but permanent deletion of the orexinergic system has marginal or controversial effects. Thus even an increase rather than the expected decrease in body mass may occur on deletions of different components of the orexinergic system..

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	179	The role of orexins in sleep seems clearer in light of the connection of the narcoleptic phenotype to orexin cell loss and the similar symptomatology occurring in functional orexin or orexin receptor loss. In this context it also appears quite clear that a major part of orexin effects is mediated via monoaminergic systems, which regulate cholinergic pathways involved in the initiation of REM sleep (reviewed in, e.g., Refs. 74, 90). Yet it is unclear how the activity of the orexinergic cells themselves is regulated. Use of orexin antagonists as hypnotics could prove rewarding because many commonly used hypnotics interfere with REM sleep and cause tolerance, addiction, and memory disturbances. An interesting question is whether there is an overlap between cells regulating feeding and sleep in the lateral hypothalamus. Is, for instance, feeding behavior associated with arousal effects of orexins? Possibilities in the future to devise better pharmacological methods for identification of different orexinergic neurons as well as for manipulating their function will hopefully give answers to these questions..

The presence of orexins and their receptors in many peripheral organs such as the intestine, endocrine pancreas, adrenals, and pituitary suggests that this may be the case. Could orexins even transmit signals from the periphery to the CNS? As discussed above, the few studies available suggest separate "peripheral" and "central" orexinergic systems. In some studies changes in central orexin concentrations are not reflected in the periphery, and in narcoleptics devoid of central orexins, orexins are still found in the plasma. This may indicate that the plasma orexin levels reflect peripherally produced orexins. Are the peripheral orexin receptors similar to the central? At least in the adrenal cortical zona fasciculata/reticularis orexin receptors appear to couple to cAMP elevation and not to Ca2+ elevation. Does this reflect different receptor subtypesas suggested by some studiesor coupling to different signal pathways? Cell lines and primary cultures from peripheral tissues should provide a lot of the missing information in this context..

The ability of exogenous peptide to activate sympathetic tone, increase locomotor activity, and alter feeding behavior, together with the observed alterations in those functions in knockout animals, strongly suggests important neural actions of the endogenous orexins/hypocretins. Likewise, the action of exogenously administered peptides to alter endocrine function, in particular corticotropin release, has now been mirrored by potential endocrinopathies in knockout animals. Thus these pluripotent peptides hold great potential not only for the treatment of human narcolepsy but also to provide insight into the coordinated regulation of multiple physiological systems..

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	8	A REMARKABLE CONVERGENCE of independent efforts occurred early in 1998, when the La Jolla and Dallas groups simultaneously reported the predicted (6) or elucidated (29) structures of two peptides that would become named the hypocretins (6) or, alternatively, the orexins (29). These peptides, known to be processed from the same prohormone, were recognized to be produced in brain in a remarkably circumscribed location, the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area, a region known to be important in feeding behavior (29). Axonal projections to multiple brain sites (4-6, 21, 25, 29, 38) predicted a diversity of biological actions, and it was clear from the beginning that the peptides exerted membrane effects similar to recognized neurotransmitters (6, 8, 42) and might have a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of feeding behavior (13, 29, 31). For simplicity, these peptides will be referred to as the orexins. Orexin A (hypocretin-1) is a 33-amino acid peptide with two internal disulfide linkages, a pyroglutamyl residue in the NH2 terminus and an amidated COOH terminus. Orexin B (hypocretin-2) is 28 amino acids in length, lacks internal disulfide bonds, but similarly has an amidated COOH terminus. In their initial description of the orexins, Yanigisawa's group (Sakurai et al., Ref. 29) also identified the two orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R. Although both are G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R appears to couple via the Gq/11 subclass of heteromeric receptors, and OX2R may couple through either the Gq/11 or the Gi/o subclasses (29, 42). It is clear that OX1R prefers orexin A as a ligand, whereas OX2R binds orexin A or orexin B with similar affinities (29). Finally, it should be recognized that, in addition to a broad projection field originating from the orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic/perifornical area, unique distributions of OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist (17, 19, 29, 41), establishing the potential for the development of pharmacological agents that interact uniquely at a single subclass of orexin receptor and therefore act as selective agonists or antagonists for specific biological actions of the endogenous peptides..

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	11	Although it is agreed that exogenously applied orexin can stimulate feeding and that orexin production is determined by the metabolic state of the animal (see review by Mieda and Yanagisawa, Ref. 20), most investigators recognize the effects of the orexins to be less potent than those of neuropeptide Y (NPY; see review by Smart et al., Ref. 37). However, it must be recognized that multiple peptide systems interact to control the feeding response, and the hierarchy within those systems is not clearly established. Pretreatment with NPY antagonists significantly decreased the feeding response to exogenously administered orexin (7, 44), suggesting that NPY neurons are located downstream in the "wiring" diagram; however, evidence does exist for a potential opposite to be true, i.e., orexin neurons located farther downstream to NPY in a series circuit controlling feeding (22). There is strong evidence for the innervation of NPY neurons by orexin terminals in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (5, 11), and central administration of a dose of orexin that stimulated feeding significantly increased NPY mRNA in that nuclear group as well (16). Convincing evidence for a physiologically relevant role for the endogenous orexins in the CNS control of feeding comes from passive immunoneutralization studies, in which compromise of the bioactivity of endogenous orexin (22, 43) with neutralizing antibodies reduced feeding in response to an overnight fast. At least one group, with access to the compound, observed decreased feeding in response to exogenously applied orexin or fast-induced feeding after administration of the relatively selective nonpeptide OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (27). Orexin knockout mice (preprohormone gene deletion) ate less than wild-type littermates (2), again suggesting a physiologically relevant role for endogenous orexin in the regulation of appetite. However, these mice grew normally; thus some other determinant of growth or body weight must compensate for the decreased feeding. There are two excellent possibilities: motor activity and metabolic state..

Convincing evidence for a physiologically relevant role for the endogenous orexins in the CNS control of feeding comes from passive immunoneutralization studies, in which compromise of the bioactivity of endogenous orexin (22, 43) with neutralizing antibodies reduced feeding in response to an overnight fast. At least one group, with access to the compound, observed decreased feeding in response to exogenously applied orexin or fast-induced feeding after administration of the relatively selective nonpeptide OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (27). Orexin knockout mice (preprohormone gene deletion) ate less than wild-type littermates (2), again suggesting a physiologically relevant role for endogenous orexin in the regulation of appetite. However, these mice grew normally; thus some other determinant of growth or body weight must compensate for the decreased feeding. There are two excellent possibilities: motor activity and metabolic state..
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	13	Early on, it was recognized that orexins stimulated motor activity and apparently increased arousal state (8, 30). The peptides also stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity (3, 30, 34, 36), and it was thought that the increase in feeding might actually have been secondary to the increased arousal state or metabolic demand (18). It is clear that locomotor activity and time spent in the awake state increased in the animals administered orexin (8). Thus, in addition to stimulating feeding, these peptides stimulated energy expenditure (45). Things became much clearer when Yanagisawa and colleagues (Chemelli et al., Ref. 2) once again demonstrated their technical expertise by developing an orexin gene knockout mouse. This model proved the importance of the endogenous orexin system to sleep/wakefulness but at the same time cast doubt on the physiological relevance of the observed effects of the peptides on feeding behavior and metabolism. These mice displayed a behavioral phenotype quite similar to human and canine models of narcolepsy (2, 15, 25), with distinct periods of behavioral arrest and the intrusion of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep into the normal waking state. If the primary function of the orexins were to control feeding and metabolic rate, as the pharmacological studies had suggested, then these animals would have been expected to display phenotypic changes reflective of the loss of those activities. However, the mice were reported to be otherwise phenotypically normal, and their general metabolic state, as mirrored by serum electrolytes and glucose levels, was similar to that of the wild-type littermates at 14-15 wk of age. In addition, the mice were fertile; thus the pharmacological effects previously reported on reproductive hormone (8, 26, 28, 39) and growth hormone (8) secretion did not appear to have a physiological expression in these animals at the times studied..

On the contrary, it had been recognized that human narcolepsy was in almost all cases not a frank lack of orexin gene expression throughout life, but instead a gradual loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus with aging (24, 40). Thus to faithfully recreate the mouse equivalent of the human model, Yanagisawa and colleagues (Hara et al., Ref. 9), in yet another brilliant series of experiments, created mice harboring the toxic ataxin-3 gene attached to the orexin promotor. The ataxin-3 gene encodes a protein with extended polyglutamine repeats that caused apoptosis when expressed in transfected cells in vitro (46). Already by 2 wk of age, the expression of the transgene could be detected in orexin-producing neurons, and by 4-8 wk of age, the majority of the orexin-producing neurons had been eliminated. Similarly, by 8 wk of age in the ataxin-3-transgenic mice, no preproorexin mRNA could be detected, whereas the expression of two other peptides known to be involved in the control of feeding, NPY and melanin-concentrating hormone, appeared normal (9)..

Fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness characteristic of the orexin-knockout animals was also observed in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice. This included increased frequency of entry into and duration of REM sleep. Thus these mice, because of the delayed onset of compromise of orexin-producing neurons, more faithfully mirrored the situation in human narcolepsy, which is characterized by a slowly progressive disease due to the "dropping out" of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (40)..

One might have expected that, as these orexin/ataxin-3 mice aged, they would lose weight compared with wild-type controls due to the loss of the orexigenic action of the peptides. Instead, even with a predicted decrease in food intake, they became obese (9). The obese phenotype might have been due to the fact that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice displayed decreased spontaneous motor activity during the dark phase compared with controls, and thus their energy expenditure might possibly have been less, leading to obesity. This would suggest that the ability of exogenous peptide to stimulate arousal and sympathetic nervous system and locomotor activity (3, 8, 30, 36) in the earlier pharmacological studies had physiological correlates..

(9) was that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice developed, along with obesity, what appeared to be late-onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes). Earlier work in the preproorexin gene knockout animals had not suggested any alterations in glucose homeostasis, and there are no reports of direct effects of orexin on insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets or -cells themselves. There is one report that intravenous administration of orexin elevates circulating insulin and glucose levels in rats, and that orexin A stimulates insulin release in vitro from isolated, perfused pancreas preparations (23), but then only at doses higher than those present in the gland or the circulation. The observed phenotype of obesity and diabetes in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice resembles the situation in some human narcoleptic patients (10, 35). It also mirrors the situation in cortisol excess, in which the obesity is the result of a combination of fat redistribution, due to altered insulin sensitivity, and increased appetite. It is our hypothesis that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice represent exactly the same pathology..

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	24	Central administration of orexin in conscious rats resulted in a behavioral response similar to the stress response (8, 30). This included increased grooming and motor activity (e.g., searching behavior). These injections also resulted in increased sympathetic nervous system tone, reflected by increased heart rate and blood pressure (3, 30, 36). It is not known whether the orexin/ataxin-3 mice display a "reset" or depressed autonomic system, and it will be important to examine that possibility. Similarly, central administration of orexin stimulated corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone release (8, 12, 14, 34) in vivo, an action that was blocked by pretreatment of the animals with a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist (12, 34). CRF is a recognized anorexigenic/anxiogenic peptide (8), and the loss of orexin neurons might predict not only a decrease in CRF release into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal vessels in response to stress but also the loss of a potential stimulatory action of orexin on CRF neurons important in the "shut-off" of feeding cues. Thus, in the absence of orexin, less CRF would be released under basal and stimulated conditions, and the animal, in addition to feeding for longer periods, would become corticosterone deficient. Instead, quite the opposite was observed. The animals ate less and appeared to experience corticosterone excess. The decreased feeding observed clearly might be due to the loss of the orexigenic drive provided by the endogenous peptide, but what might explain the apparent corticosterone excess?.

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	26	We have thought that the ability of centrally administered orexin to stimulate ACTH and corticosterone release in vivo (8, 12, 14, 34) was a reflection of a generalized stress effect of the exogenous peptide (30, 36) and not an indication of the role of endogenous orexin in the day-to-day control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Instead, we have identified direct anterior pituitary effects of the orexins/hypocretins (32) that potentially explain the metabolic phenotype of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice (9). Orexin-immunopositive nerve terminals exist in the external lamina of the median eminence (4), the site of diffusion of neuroendocrine factors into the hypophysial-portal vessels connecting the hypothalamus with the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In addition, both of the OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist in the anterior lobe, and the OX1R has been localized to corticotrophs in the human gland (1). We have demonstrated the significant inhibitory effect of the orexins on CRF-stimulated ACTH release from cultured, anterior pituitary cells (32). The effect appeared to be mediated by the OX1R subtype and a PKC-dependent mechanism, suggesting activation of a Gq-initiated signaling pathway (32). More recently, we have demonstrated that orexin stimulated transient elevations in intracellular inositol trisphosphate levels (33), and Ferguson and Samson (A. V. Ferguson and W. K. Samson, unpublished observations) have observed calcium transients in fura 2-labeled, CRF-responsive pituitary cells in vitro (A. V. Ferguson and W. K. Samson, unpublished observations). This would suggest that binding of orexin to the OX1R on corticotrophs results in activation of phospholipase C, with subsequent formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Because we have blocked the inhibitory action of orexin on CRF-induced ACTH release with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, we hypothesize that the formation of DAG results in the activation of a potassium channel, resulting in hyperpolarization of the corticotroph and a "right shift" in the CRF concentration-response curve. This hypothesis is supported by our demonstration that pretreatment of the cells with a concentration of the potassium channel inhibitor glyburide, which by itself did not alter basal or CRF-stimulated hormone release, resulted in a complete reversal of the inhibitory effects of orexin (33)..

The loss of a physiologically relevant, inhibitory effect of peptide over time as the orexin neurons degenerate would lead to increased sensitivity of the corticotrophs to CRF, with the resultant resetting of corticosteroid release and apparent corticosteroid excess. This then might explain the appearance of diabetes to be in reality a situation of decreased insulin sensitivity caused by the corticosterone excess. Certainly the obese appearance of these mice would support such a hypothesis..

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hypocretin (orexin) peptides are involved in the regulation of energy balance and pituitary hormone release. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by disruption of hypocretin neurotransmission. Pituitary LH secretion is diminished in hypocretin-deficient animal models, and intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in rats. We evaluated whether hypocretin deficiency affects gonadotropin release in humans. To this end, we deconvolved 24-h serum concentrations of LH and FSH in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic males (N) and seven controls (C) matched for age, body mass index, and sex. Basal plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were similar in both groups. Mean 24-h LH concentration was significantly lower in narcolepsy patients [3.0  plus or minus  0.4 (N) vs. 4.2  plus or minus  0.3 (C) U/l, P = 0.01], which was primarily due to a reduction of pulsatile LH secretion [23.5  plus or minus  1.6 (N) vs. 34.3  plus or minus  4.9 (C) U l to 1 24 h to 1, P = 0.02]. The orderliness of LH and FSH secretion, quantitated by the approximate entropy statistic, was greater in patients than in controls. In contrast, all other features of FSH release were similar in narcoleptic and control groups. Also, LH and FSH secretions in response to intravenous administration of 100  microg of GnRH were similar in patients and controls. These data indicate that endogenous hypocretins are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis activity in humans. In particular, reduced LH release in the face of normal pituitary responsivity to GnRH stimulation in narcoleptic men suggests that hypocretins promote endogenous GnRH secretion..

It is caused by the progressive loss of hypocretin neurons in the brain (28, 31). Hypocretin neuronal cell bodies are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area (41), but axonal projections throughout the central nervous system predict diverse biological actions (7). Indeed, hypocretin peptides 1 and 2 (also called orexin A and B) appear to affect feeding behavior and energy expenditure, arousal, autonomic outflow, and a variety of neuroendocrine ensembles (9, 10, 43, 49). Therefore, apart from its well-recognized neurological manifestations, the clinical syndrome of hypocretin deficiency in humans may encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic anomalies. In keeping with this postulate, we recently identified aberrations of the pituitary-adrenal and somatotropic ensembles and circulating leptin concentrations in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men (15, 17, 29)..

These nuclei are involved in the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (50). Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretins acutely induces LH release in ovarian-steroid-primed ovariectomized rats (37). Also, hypocretin-1 promotes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in hypothalamic explants from male rats (40), and intracerebroventricular administration of anti-hypocretin antibody completely abolishes the preovulatory LH surge in intact female rats (14). Thus the available data suggest that endogenous hypocretin peptides stimulate LH release in rodents. It is currently unknown whether these peptides exert analogous effects in humans. As far as we are aware, the impact of hypocretins on FSH secretion has not been investigated to date..

The diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy was made on clinical grounds by a physician experienced with narcolepsy (G. J. Lammers). Also, the result of a multiple sleep latency test was typical for narcolepsy in all patients (23). In addition, all patients were HLA-DR2/DQB1*0602 positive (22) and lacked hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid [measurements as previously described (28)]. All subjects were free of medication or (3 patients) had discontinued medication for 2 wk before the study.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	24	Serum LH and FSH concentrations were measured with time-resolved immunofluorometric assays (Wallac, Turku, Finland), with coefficients of variation (CV) of 3.9 to 6.8% in the concentration range of 5.5 to 147 U/l for LH and 3.7 to 5.3% in the concentration range of 5.1 to 41.3 U/l for FSH. Testosterone was measured with a coated-tube radioimmunoassay (RIA; Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) with a CV of 10.6 to 18.6% in the concentration range of 2.7 to 44.3 nmol/l. SHBG was measured with an immunoradiometric assay (Spectria, Espoo, Finland) and serum estradiol with an RIA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratory, Webster, TX). All samples of each gonadotropin 24-h profile were processed in the same assay procedure. In addition, the leptin concentration was measured in every 20-min sample by RIA (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The detection limit of the assay was 0.5  microg/l, and the CV was 3.4 to 8.3% in the concentration range of 4.9 to 25.6  microg/l. Details on leptin secretion in narcolepsy were previously published, but here we report only the 24-h mean leptin concentration in relation to LH parameters and testosterone (15)..
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	25	Deconvolution analysis. Deconvolution analysis (47) was used to estimate the four secretory and clearance measures of interest: 1) the number and locations of secretory events; 2) the amplitudes of secretory bursts; 3) the durations of randomly dispersed LH and FSH secretory bursts; and 4) the endogenous single-component, subject-specific plasma half-lives of LH and FSH. It was assumed that the gonadotropin distribution volumes and LH and FSH half-lives were time and concentration invariant. The following parameters were calculated: half-duration of secretory bursts (duration of the secretory burst at half-maximal amplitude), hormone half-life, burst frequency, amplitude of the secretory burst (maximal secretory rate attained within a burst), mass secreted per burst, basal secretion rate (only for LH), pulsatile secretion rate (product of burst frequency and mean burst mass) and total secretion (sum of basal and pulsatile). Based on recent validation studies in men, deconvolution analysis was carried out at 95% joint statistical confidence intervals for all calculated LH and FSH amplitudes (13, 25)..

The univariate approximate entropy (ApEn) statistic was developed to quantify the degree of irregularity, or disorderliness, of a time series (33). Technically, ApEn quantifies the summed logarithmic likelihood that templates (of length m) of patterns in the data that are similar (within r) remain similar (within the same tolerance r) on next incremental comparison and has been formally defined elsewhere (34). The ApEn calculation provides a single nonnegative number, which is an ensemble estimate of relative process randomness, wherein larger ApEn values denote greater irregularity. Cross-ApEn (X-ApEn) quantifies joint pattern synchrony between two separate but parallel time series after standardization (z-score transformation) (36, 38). In the present analysis, we calculated X-ApEn assuming r = 20% of the SD of the individual time-series and m = 1; hence, use of the designation X-ApEn (1, 20%). This parameter set affords sensitive, valid, and statistically well-replicated ApEn and X-ApEn metrics for assessing hormone time series of this length (35, 36). Both ApEn and X-ApEn results are reported as the ratio of the absolute value to that of the mean of 1,000 randomly shuffled data series, values approaching 1.0 denoting complete randomness..

Student's one-tailed t-test was used to evaluate the a priori hypothesis that LH secretion is reduced in narcoleptic men. All other comparisons were statistically evaluated by two-tailed Student's t-test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for two samples, where appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using Systat (release 10.0; Systat, Richmond, CA)..

The reduction of the plasma LH concentration in narcoleptics is accounted for by a diminution of pulsatile LH release (by 30% compared with healthy controls), which cannot be attributed to insensitivity of the pituitary gonadotrophs to GnRH stimulation. LH burst frequency and burst mass were reduced in narcoleptic men. In contrast, plasma FSH concentrations and various features of FSH secretion were similar in narcoleptics and controls..

In particular, the fact that spontaneous LH secretion is blunted, whereas pituitary responsiveness to GnRH stimulation is intact in narcoleptic subjects, suggests that hypocretin deficiency primarily inhibits hypothalamic GnRH release. This inference agrees with studies in male rats showing that hypocretin-1 promotes GnRH release from hypothalamic explants (40). Moreover, hypocretin inputs are abundant in the preoptic area that contains many GnRH neurons (50), which coexpress hypocretin-1 receptors and are in direct contact with hypocretin fibers (3). These physiological and anatomical observations obviously support the notion that hypocretin peptides are involved in the regulation of GnRH release. The fact that FSH secretion is not diminished (whereas LH release is) in narcoleptic subjects may imply that hypocretins specifically modulate GnRH burst frequency, as LH secretion is particularly enhanced by high-frequency bursts, whereas low-frequency bursts predominantly promote FSH release (20)..

We have previously shown (15) that the plasma leptin concentration is considerably reduced in narcoleptic men. Leptin has emerged as an important modulator of the HPG axis (5). Indeed, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are hypogonadotropic and sterile, and recombinant leptin administration rescues these defects in ob/ob males (24) and females (6). Moreover, the circadian rhythm of plasma leptin levels is synchronous with that of LH concentrations (18), and the reduction of LH secretion induced by fasting in the rat and in humans can be reversed by leptin administration (1, 4, 8). These data indicate that leptin stimulates LH release and that genetic and/or physiological alterations of circulating leptin levels can impact pituitary gonadotropin release. In this context, it is conceivable that the reduction of the plasma leptin concentration in narcoleptics (15) is involved in the diminution of pituitary LH release in these patients, but it should be mentioned that we could not demonstrate a (linear) correlation between mean circulating leptin concentration and LH production..

Recently, it has become clear that leptin is involved in the (local) regulation of testosterone synthesis and secretion in the male rat gonad (44). Direct evidence for such action in humans is not available, but an inverse relation between serum testosterone and leptin has been demonstrated (19). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of leptin on testosterone (and adrenal hormone) secretion might be relevant in narcoleptic patients, because narcoleptics exhibit a 50% reduction in circulating leptin concentration, which may unleash gonadal testosterone secretion to compensate for diminished LH drive (15). The finding of an inverse relationship between testosterone and leptin in our subjects reinforces this view..

Relevant for the present investigation was the recent finding of the mRNA expression of the OX1 but not of the OX2 receptor in the male rat gonad (2). Activation of the OX1 receptor stimulates testosterone secretion, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a physiological (modulating) role of the orexin system in concert with leptin and ghrelin at the testicular level (45). The significance of these findings for human physiology needs to be explored. However, OX1 and OX2 receptor expression was demonstrated in the male human reproductive system, including the testis, suggesting that orexins can directly impact gonadal hormone release in humans as well as in rodents (12)..

Some early reports have suggested that narcolepsy is associated with impaired fertility (39), but since then these suggestions have not been confirmed, as far as we are aware. Moreover, it is not our clinical impression that narcoleptic (male) patients are less fertile, and gonadal hormone concentrations in plasma were normal in narcoleptics despite the reduction of LH levels. Thus it seems unlikely that the partial hypogonadotropism observed here has clinical sequelae. Nevertheless, in view of our findings in males, it is warranted to investigate narcoleptic females across the menstrual cycle for putative defects in ovarian function..

With the use of the mouse model, unprecedented progress in our understanding of sleep physiology and the treatment of sleep disorders is awaited. This review is intended to provide an overview of available methods and techniques for genetic dissection of sleep in mice. Limits and advantages of different approaches are discussed to highlight the necessity for combining methods to avoid erroneous interpretations.

However, substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different aspects of sleep physiology. We now know most of the neuronal substrates, neurochemical messengers, and regulatory processes involved in initiating and maintaining sleep. How can we further our understanding of sleep toward its function? Can molecular genetics bring new insights? Here, we first give a historical perspective on the genetics of sleep and then continue to review the available methods for the genetic dissection of sleep as an experimental approach that can be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art electrophysiological, neuroanatomic, and pharmacological techniques already used with great success in sleep research. We also caution against making premature interpretations of molecular findings of complex traits that should only be attempted within the general physiology of an intact organism..

Simple laws have been discovered, according to which simple monogenic autosomal or recessive phenotypes segregate and are inherited on the basis of the assumptions of their molecular substrates, i.e., genes. However, these types of traits are far less prevalent than those that cannot be attributed to the influence of single genes. Nevertheless, shortly after the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG), Vogel (82) was one of the first to notice that even a complex phenotype like the EEG is under strong genetic control. Segregation analysis in pedigrees carrying rare EEG variants was concordant with classical genetic laws, suggesting the presence of single gene effects (83-85). Results from twin studies also indicated that the EEG patterns of monozygotic (MZ) twins have a much higher resemblance than those of dizygotic (DZ) twins or unrelated subjects (33, 82, 92), again confirming that this highly complex functional brain phenotype might be tightly controlled by genes and little (if any) affected by environment..

Results from twin studies also indicated that the EEG patterns of monozygotic (MZ) twins have a much higher resemblance than those of dizygotic (DZ) twins or unrelated subjects (33, 82, 92), again confirming that this highly complex functional brain phenotype might be tightly controlled by genes and little (if any) affected by environment..

Gedda (23) reported rare cases of concordant long sleepers (up to 15 h) in MZ twins. Gedda and Brenci (24) first estimated that the heritability (percentage of variance explained by the additive effects of genes) of sleep duration is over 30%. These authors later confirmed that sleep duration is highly similar in twins living apart (25), discounting the influence of possible environmental effects. More recent observations in twins indicated that even the pattern of rapid eye movements present higher concordance between MZ than between DZ twins (8) and that between 40 and 50% of the variance in sleep duration and the presence of a sleep disorder can be accounted for by genetic effects (30, 50). Zung and Wilson (94) performed the first polygraphic sleep recordings in twins in 1966; they found the temporal sequence of sleep stages to be almost completely concordant between MZ twins. Between 1983 and 1998, detailed polygraphic analyses were performed in twins; all of these studies reported surprising similarities between MZ twins (31, 39-41, 87). Experimental genetics of sleep in mice was pioneered by Valatx in the early 1970s. Over a time span of 15 years, Valatx's group (72-77) conducted several crossing experiments and recorded sleep in hundreds of inbred, recombinant inbred (RI), and hybrid mice, mainly to follow the segregation of paradoxical sleep (PS) amount. These studies, together with a diallelique (reciprocal crossing between several inbred strains) sleep experiment in mice performed by Friedmann (22), clearly indicated that, although some aspects of sleep may follow a simple segregation, the classical genetic laws cannot predict most others..

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although these now classical genetic sleep studies favor a strong genetic basis for sleep, we still have no clue about possible molecular mechanisms. The first attempts to identify the molecular basis of sleep have been based on the assumption that there must be genes that change their expression according to the behavioral state (sleep vs. wake) and/or time spent in a particular state. Closely related examples come from the circadian field where dramatic changes in the expression of several clock genes occur according to a strict circadian pattern (reviewed in Ref. 86). The two-process model of sleep regulation (10), by its remarkable predictions on the homeostatic aspects of sleep, motivated the first molecular investigation of sleep. Because sleep need and intensity are homeostatically regulated, deprivation of sleep should lead to a change in the expression of those genes, of which the product(s) is necessary for recovery or is (at least) involved in sleep regulation. Rhyner et al. (54) performed the first substractive hybridization in sleep-deprived vs. control rats and isolated several clones with increased or decreased relative expression, among which neurogranin and dendrin were later identified (47-48). The sleep-deprivation paradigm has since become the method of choice in gene expression experiments aimed at uncovering molecular bases of sleep regulatory processes (reviewed in Ref. 9). Our laboratory (56) has already discussed several conceptual problems of this approach. In summary, there are two major limitations. First is the fact that the expression of many genes varies with vigilance state rather than themselves being actively involved in vigilance state regulation. This weakness of correlative gene expression can only be overcome by confirming the involvement of the identified genes by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. Second, the very high complexity of mammalian brain mRNA populations is a technical limitation; however, this can be overcome by recent developments in gene expression profiling (see below). Nevertheless, the identification of cortistatin and orexin (12, 13) with specific actions on sleep shows that gene expression investigation can be highly successful..

Potential advantages and problems have been addressed in several reviews (for a recent review, see Ref. 88).

However, many investigators in the field benefit from the availability of such transgenic models to answer sleep-related questions. The accumulated results indicate that all transgenic mice studies published thus far (see Table 1) report some sleep-related abnormalities, strongly suggesting either the nonspecific effects of gene manipulations and/or the complex integrative nature of sleep that makes it highly sensitive to many physiological changes..

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	24	A unique "coincidental" sleep-related gene discovery concerns the orexin system. Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic neuropeptides acting on orexin 1 and 2 receptors and first thought to be involved in feeding behavior (13, 55). Mignot's group (38) identified, through linkage analysis and positional cloning, mutations in the orexin 2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy, an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy. Independently and almost simultaneously, Yanagisawa's group (7), who were interested in the role of orexins in feeding behavior, discovered in the mouse a phenotype similar to canine and human narcolepsy after a targeted deletion of the preproorexin gene. More recently, the orexin system has also been implicated in the etiology of human narcolepsy; narcoleptic patients have undetectable orexin A levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (49), and in a small number of postmortem cases a dramatic reduction in the number of orexin-containing neurons was observed in the hypothalamus (51, 65). These unexpected observations led Sakurai's group (29) to generate the first transgenic mice to specifically investigate the role of the orexin system in vigilance states. These transgenic mice carry the promoter of the human preproorexin gene ligated to a truncated human ataxin-3, a gene that can induce cell death. The specific expression of this transgene construct in orexin-containing neurons induces apoptosis between 4 and 15 wk of age. Adult orexin/ataxin-3 mice show narcolepsy, hypophagia, and obesity (29). However, although the causal implication of the orexin system in narcolepsy is now established, its direct and causal involvement in normal sleep regulation, as is often claimed (3, 14, 28, 34, 64, 89, 91), remains to be elucidated..

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	29	The fundamental basis of this approach is the linkage disequilibrium between closely localized genes. If a gene is affecting a trait, there must be in addition to this gene other genetic material tightly linked to it and segregating from generation to generation together with the trait under study. Therefore, instead of testing all genes of an organism to check for cosegregation with a trait (linkage), one needs to test only a small panel of genes at regular intervals throughout the genome to obtain sufficient information on the large chromosomal pieces that are transmitted as a single unit. To follow the segregation of genes, they must be polymorphic (nucleotide variation from individual to individual); this may not be the case, or the sequence of the gene may be unknown. A powerful substitute is provided by highly polymorphic elements (restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLPs, simple sequence length polymorphisms or SSLPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, and so forth), mostly found in the noncoding genetic material. The more polymorphic markers are tested, the more accurate the mapping will be. A major question is how big the effect of a gene should be to be detected. Mutations in a single gene (e.g., orexin 2 receptor) can produce remarkable changes in a trait that is readily recognized (e.g., the monogenic autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy), whereas natural variations in genes controlling complex traits may have only subtle effects. Therefore, genome-wide approaches to dissect complex traits should be highly sensitive to detect all genes with variable effects on the trait..

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	31	Basically, two major approaches are available: mutagenesis and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. The mutagenesis approach is straightforward: a mutagen like N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea is used to mutate at random the whole genome; this is followed by high-throughput screening of all mutant offspring to detect a major effect on a given phenotype. Both dominant and recessive mutations can be screened in the same way as a single gene mutation in a pathological condition. Once the mutated gene is localized, candidate gene or positional cloning approaches are used for its identification, and ultimately its functional analysis can be performed by gain or loss of function. The remarkable demonstration of this technique is provided by the isolation of Clock, one of the key mammalian circadian clock genes (1, 35, 81). However, genetic screens in this approach are for fully penetrant dominant and recessive mutations and therefore cannot identify small-effect sequence variations that may turn out to be essential for some aspects of the phenotype. In addition, with currently available technologies, recording and analyzing sleep of thousands of mice in a mutant screen does not seem feasible, at least not in a single academic laboratory. QTL analysis has been proposed as a powerful approach in the genetic dissection of complex traits (11, 17, 36). Although natural allelic variation of genes with small effect can be mapped through QTL analysis, the final identification of sequence variants (quantitative trait nucleotides or QTNs; Ref. 42) in the QTL region with biologically significant effects on the phenotype may represent prohibitive efforts in terms of both phenotyping and genotyping. An excellent example of how QTL analysis can further our understanding of complex traits was recently provided by Takahashi's group (57) for the circadian behavior in mice. Although most of the molecular machinery of the circadian timekeeping system has been discovered mainly by direct molecular techniques and mutagenesis, the identified genes do not explain the complexity of the observed circadian behavior. For instance, none of the clock genes has been found to be involved in the approximately 1-h difference in free-running period between BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains. Takahashi's group (57) used QTL analysis in a BALB/c  x  C57BL/6 (CXB) intercross and discovered several new loci with epistatic interaction..

For instance, the 24-h amount of sleep shows highly significant differences between inbred mouse strains (21, 22, 74). We have shown that AKR mice sleep ~3 h more than DBA mice over a 24-h period (21). As for the differences in the period of circadian rhythms, not a single gene but many genes with complex interactions may be found to account for this difference. We therefore initiated a series of experiments to dissect different phenotypic aspects of sleep in mice through QTL analysis. Table 2 summarizes the main quantitative aspects of sleep for those inbred strains of mice that differed the most. Note that most differences between high and low strains are consistent between the two studies performed 25 years apart (usually, differences between two extreme strains expressed in standard deviations are twice as large in Ref. 74 due to smaller within-strain standard deviations based on repeated measures; this is because data in Ref. 74 are based on 5-day continuous recordings instead of single 24-h recordings in Ref. 21)..

Basically, two inbred mouse strains differing in the trait of interest are crossed and their F1 offspring are either intercrossed to generate F2 or backcrossed to one of the progenitor strains to generate backcross populations. Further random intercross or backcross generations can be performed to generate advanced intercross and backcross populations. To generate RI sets, F2 mice are brother  x  sister mated until full homozygosity, thereby "fixing" unique sets of recombinations in several inbred lines. Heterogeneous stocks are generated by intercrossing several inbred mouse strains over many generations and therefore represent higher rates of recombination and polymorphism useful for fine mapping (44, 63). Although RIs are usually not suitable for QTL mapping due to their limited progenitor strains and number, for QTLs of large effects, they may provide significant mapping accuracy because of the fourfold increase in recombination compared with a F2 population (11). Also, for complex phenotypes with high variability, the use of RIs is advantageous because several individuals per strain are tested instead of, for example, a single F2 animal. Therefore, as a first step, we have performed QTL analysis in two RI sets. In seven CXB RIs, QTLs were identified for the amount of PS on chromosomes 5, 7, 12, and 17 (61). Toth and Williams (71) conducted a similar study in 13 CXB RIs and reported provisional QTLs on chromosomes 4, 16, and 17 for the amount of PS during the light period. Because of a small number of CXB RIs (n = 7-13), none of the QTLs identified could satisfy standard significance levels (37). Also, the discrepancy between the two referenced works indicates that, as in any linkage study, replication is needed, especially when the findings are based on a limited number of animals and/or strains (for a recent review, see also Ref. 69). QTL analysis in 25 C57BL/6  x  DBA/2 (BXD) RIs identified the first significant QTL for the amount of PS in the 12-h light period on chromosome 1 (60). We have estimated in BXD RIs that between 40 and 60% of variance in sleep amounts can be accounted for by the additive effects of 6-15 genes, confirming a polygenic basis for differences in sleep amounts..

Also, for complex phenotypes with high variability, the use of RIs is advantageous because several individuals per strain are tested instead of, for example, a single F2 animal. Therefore, as a first step, we have performed QTL analysis in two RI sets. In seven CXB RIs, QTLs were identified for the amount of PS on chromosomes 5, 7, 12, and 17 (61). Toth and Williams (71) conducted a similar study in 13 CXB RIs and reported provisional QTLs on chromosomes 4, 16, and 17 for the amount of PS during the light period. Because of a small number of CXB RIs (n = 7-13), none of the QTLs identified could satisfy standard significance levels (37). Also, the discrepancy between the two referenced works indicates that, as in any linkage study, replication is needed, especially when the findings are based on a limited number of animals and/or strains (for a recent review, see also Ref. 69). QTL analysis in 25 C57BL/6  x  DBA/2 (BXD) RIs identified the first significant QTL for the amount of PS in the 12-h light period on chromosome 1 (60). We have estimated in BXD RIs that between 40 and 60% of variance in sleep amounts can be accounted for by the additive effects of 6-15 genes, confirming a polygenic basis for differences in sleep amounts..

Slow-wave sleep is characterized by oscillations in the delta (1-4 Hz) and spindle (11-15 Hz) frequency ranges, whereas PS, especially in rodents, is characterized by theta oscillations (5-9 Hz). Wakefulness encompasses a variety of behaviors, each with a characteristic EEG pattern. Waking EEG analysis in twins demonstrated that spectral profiles are among the most heritable traits in humans (reviewed in Ref. 79), with heritability estimates ranging from 75 to 90% (80). We have shown that several spectral characteristics of sleep (Fig. 1) differ significantly between inbred mouse strains (20). Among these, the theta peak frequency during PS showed the highest difference between inbred strains, and 80% of interstrain variability could be attributed to genetic effects. We have established in intercross and backcross CXB mice that a single gene may explain most of this phenotypic variance (a major gene) (62). A high-resolution QTL mapping is needed to localize the underlying gene..

Bottom: a 10-s electroencephalogram (EEG) sample for paradoxical sleep (PS; left) and slow-wave sleep (SWS; right) from 1 representative mouse of the inbred strains for which EEG characteristics differed the most. AK, AKR/J; BR, C57BR/cdJ; C, BALB/cByJ; D2, DBA/2J. During PS, the EEG is dominated by theta oscillations (5-9 Hz). During SWS, the EEG is composed of delta (1-4 Hz), theta, and sigma (11-15 Hz) oscillations. Top: relative contribution and frequency of these EEG components can be quantified by spectral analysis. Average theta frequency during PS is ~1.5 Hz faster in BR compared with AK mice. The spectral profiles of the SWS EEG in C and D2 mice display large differences in the relative contribution of the delta and sigma frequency components. Spectral profiles are based on all 4-s epochs scored as PS or SWS in a baseline 12-h light period (n = 7/strain)..
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	44	Another aspect of the sleep EEG, with considerable importance for its homeostatic regulation, is the change in delta power (i.e., EEG power in the 1- to 4-Hz range) as a function of the prior wakefulness duration. Relative delta power can be used to index both sleep need and sleep intensity in all mammalian species studied so far. Sleep loss induces a proportional and predictable increase in delta power, which differs significantly between inbred mouse strains (18, 21). We have used the delta power rebound after a 6-h sleep deprivation to map the underlying genes in BXD RIs (18). The results confirmed that the rate at which sleep need accumulates varies greatly with genotype. One significant QTL was identified on chromosome 13 that accounted for 50% of genetic variance in this trait. These two examples suggest that quantitative sleep EEG parameters are under stronger genetic control than sleep amounts; therefore, these are more suitable for quantitative genetic dissection. Sleep amounts in mammals may be approximated by techniques other than EEG, such as the use of piezoelectric films, which would make a high-throughput genetic analysis feasible. However, success may be limited due to the highly polygenic nature of sleep amounts, suggesting the presence of many genes with small effects. On the other hand, the quantitative EEG analysis dramatically limits its wide-range use (because this involves implantation, recovery, adaptation, cabling, and time-intensive analysis) but may turn out to be more successful due to the limited number of underlying genes and the presence of major genes..

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	46	QTL analysis does not map a gene but a genetic effect in a large chromosomal region (usually between 20 and 30 cM). These large regions may contain a single major gene or several genes with small effects. Also, QTLs may interact with each other (epistasis), an effect that is difficult to detect in QTL mapping experiments. The first step is to make sure that the region contains QTLs of large enough effect. One possibility is to transfer the QTL region from one inbred strain background to another inbred background through repeated backcrossing and selection to make a congenic strain. We have reviewed sleep amount data available in eight congenic strains generated by transferring minor histocompatibility genes from the inbred strain BALB/c to the inbred background of C57BL/6 (60). In almost all cases, the results indicated that, even if the transferred pieces of chromosomes contained a large-effect QTL detected in CXB RIs, a clear effect could not be observed in the resulting congenic strain. This finding strongly suggests that 1) many genes are involved, 2) they are in interaction (epistasis), and 3) even if a major QTL is identified, its effect may vary from genetic background to genetic background due to the action of modifier genes (45). Once the QTL region is verified, the next step is to finely map the QTL down to the smallest chromosomal region (11, 17), amenable to candidate gene analysis. The final identification of functional QTNs (sequence variants) is the most difficult part, since QTNs may be found every few kilobases. Therefore, a combination of several approaches is necessary for mapping and candidate gene analysis. High-resolution QTL mapping in conjunction with future developments in high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping and the availability of whole genome sequences of several major mouse strains should identify candidate genes to be investigated. All of those candidate genes can then be mutated either by classical homologous recombination (knockout) or by the newly developed serial nested chromosomal deletions (59). Systematic crosses between increasing and decreasing QTL allele and the complete set of mutants should physically identify the functional QTN. Because most QTNs will probably be involved in gene regulation rather than being mutations affecting the protein function, further gene expression profiling with high-throughput genotyping technologies (e.g., microarray or TaqMan) and gene translation and posttranslational protein analyses should be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved. Note that finding the molecular basis in a mutagenesis experiment follows approximately the same time- and labor-intensive procedure..

If enough effort and financial resources are given to develop simplified and automated sleep recording devices, this major limitation should be overcome. Both high numbers of QTL and mutant screen experiments will thus become feasible. Once the entire mouse genome sequence becomes available, genome-wide assessment of spatial and temporal expression of genes and identification of every conceivable sequence variation will provide speedy molecular analysis of complex traits such as sleep. The genetics of sleep may also be complemented by the genetic analysis of rest activity in flies (27). Considering that we still know very little about the molecular basis of sleep and how ineffective the current treatments for common sleep disorders such as insomnia or hypersomnia are, we believe that molecular genetic approaches are still our best hope for developing better therapies and uncovering sleep functions. In this review, we have tried to show that many techniques and their combinations can be used to answer basic questions. However, relying solely on large-effect genes as revealed through mutagenesis or candidate gene approaches may bring erroneous interpretations of the complex polygenic nature of sleep mechanisms..

Injection of hypocretin-1 acutely suppresses TRH and TSH release in rats. In contrast, subchronic administration does not appear to affect the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid ensemble in animals. We explored (in 7 patients and 7 controls) whether hypocretin deficiency impacts circulating TSH levels and circadian timing of TSH release in narcoleptic humans. Plasma TSH concentration profiles (blood samples taken at 10-min intervals during 24 h) and TSH levels in response to TRH injection were analyzed by Cluster, robust regression, approximate entropy (ApEn), and deconvolution. Circulating TSH levels were lower in patients, which was primarily attributable to lower pulse amplitude and nadir concentrations. TSH secretion correlated positively with mean 24-h leptin levels (R2 = 0.46, P = 0.02) and negatively with amount of sleep (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.048). Pattern-synchrony between 24-h leptin and TSH concentrations was demonstrated by significant cross-correlation and cross-ApEn analyses with no differences between controls and patients. Sleep onset was closely associated with a fall in circulating TSH. Features of diurnal rhythmicity of circulating TSH fluctuations were similar in patients and controls, with the acrophase occurring shortly after midnight. Thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations were similar in patients and controls and did not display a diurnal rhythm. The response of plasma TSH levels to TRH was also similar in both groups. Sleep patterns in narcoleptics were significantly disorderly compared with controls, as measured by ApEn (P = 0.006). In summary, circulating TSH concentrations are low in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men, which could be attributable to their low plasma leptin levels and/or their abnormal sleep-wake cycle..

Disruption of hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission underlies the disease in animals and humans (28, 39). Hypocretins (hypocretin-1 and -2, also called orexin A and B) are produced by a small group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which project widely throughout the central nervous system (CNS) (8, 56). The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is among the various brain sites that receive hypocretin input signals (7). This nucleus harbors neurons that synthesize thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis (24). During starvation, thyroid hormone secretion is suppressed (2, 52), whereas preprohypocretin mRNA is upregulated in the lateral hypothalamus (4). This led us to hypothesize that hypocretin neural circuits can modulate the activity of hypothalamic TRH neurons and thereby impact the HPT axis..

A single intravenous or intracerebroventricular injection of hypocretin-1 in rats acutely decreased plasma TSH concentrations and hypothalamic TRH release (34). In contrast, several other papers report that hypocretin-1 has no measurable effect on the pituitary thyroid axis (16, 20, 53, 54), whereas circulating TSH was shown to increase in response to central administration of hypocretin-2 (20). Thus, although the topography of hypocretin- and thyrotrope neural circuits suggests that TRH neuronal activity is governed by hypocretin input, the nature of the signal (i.e., excitatory or inhibitory) remains unclear (where hypocretin-1 and -2 may have differential effects as a result of their distinct chemical structure)..

The free T4 concentration was measured by electrochemoluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics Nederland, Almere, The Netherlands). TSH was measured by time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The detection limit of the TSH assay is 0.05 mU/l, and the interassay coefficient of variation (CV) is  < 5%. In addition, the plasma leptin concentration was measured in every 20-min sample by RIA (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The detection limit of the assay is 0.5  microg/l, the CV is 3.4 to 8.3% in the concentration range of 4.9 to 25.6  microg/l.

The free T4 concentration was measured by electrochemoluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics Nederland, Almere, The Netherlands). TSH was measured by time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The detection limit of the TSH assay is 0.05 mU/l, and the interassay coefficient of variation (CV) is  < 5%. In addition, the plasma leptin concentration was measured in every 20-min sample by RIA (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The detection limit of the assay is 0.5  microg/l, the CV is 3.4 to 8.3% in the concentration range of 4.9 to 25.6  microg/l. A detailed description of circulating leptin levels in these narcoleptic men was previously published (22).

This computerized pulse algorithm is largely model free and identifies statistically significant pulses in relation to dose-dependent measurement error in the hormone time series. For the present analysis, a 2 x 1 test cluster configuration was used, two data points for the test nadir and one for the test peak, and a t-statistic of 2.0 for the up- and downstrokes, which minimizes both false positive and false negative peaks. The locations and widths of all significant concentration peaks were identified, the total number of peaks was counted, and the mean peak interval was calculated in minutes. In addition, the following pulse parameters were determined: peak height (highest value attained within the peak), incremental peak amplitude (the difference between peak height and prepeak nadir), and area under the peak. Interpulse valleys were identified as regions embracing nadirs with no intervening upstrokes. The total area under the curve was also calculated, as well as the summed pulse areas (59)..
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	31	Deconvolution analysis. The 24-h TSH secretion rate was calculated with Pulse. This deconvolution method is waveform independent and can be used for estimating the hormone secretion rate at each time point as well as the total 24-h rate (60). The method requires a priori specification of the plasma half-life. For the present analysis, we used a two-compartment model with a fast component of 18  plus or minus  3 min and a slow component of 90  plus or minus  5 min, with a fractional contribution of 0.32 of the slow component to the overall decay (data kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Veldhuis, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The mass of TSH released after TRH injection was also calculated by deconvolution. On a separarate occasion, patients received 200  microg of TRH intravenously in the morning, and blood samples were drawn just before the injection and at 10-min intervals for 180 min..
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	32	Approximate Entropy. The univariate approximate entropy (ApEn) statistic was developed to quantify the degree of irregularity, or disorderliness, of a time series (44, 62). Technically, ApEn quantifies the summed logarithmic likelihood that templates (of length m) of patterns in the data that are similar (within r) remain similar (within the same tolerance r) on next incremental comparison and has been formally defined elsewhere (45). The ApEn calculation provides a single nonnegative number, which is an ensemble estimate of relative process randomness, wherein larger ApEn values denote greater irregularity. Cross-ApEn (X-ApEn) quantifies joint pattern synchrony between two separate but parallel time series after standardization (z-score transformation) (47, 51). In the present analysis, we calculated X-ApEn between leptin and TSH and between sleep and TSH, assuming r = 20% of the SD of the individual time series and m = 1, and hence use the designation X-ApEn (1, 20%). This parameter set affords sensitive, valid, and statistically well-replicated ApEn and X-ApEn metrics for assessing hormone time series of this length (46). Both ApEn and X-ApEn results are reported as absolute values and the ratio of the absolute value to that of the mean of 1,000 randomly shuffled data series, values approaching 1.0 denote complete randomness..

A host of other hormones and neurotransmitters, including somatostatin, catecholamines, various cytokines, and leptin modulate this neuroendocrine ensemble (13, 58). In addition, sleep has an inhibitory effect on TSH secretion (1, 42). TRH is synthesized in the thyrotropic area of the PVN and in the anterior pituitary, where it acts to promote TSH secretion through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, respectively (58). Although hypocretin neuronal cell bodies heavily project to the PVN (43), it is currently unknown whether hypocretin axons actually synapse with TRH neurons. It is therefore uncertain whether hypocretins can directly modulate TRH synthesis and release and thus affect TSH secretion. Also, experiments investigating the impact of (exogenous) hypocretin peptides on TSH release in rodents have yielded inconclusive results. Intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of hypocretin-1 either reduced plasma TSH levels or showed no effect on TSH and/or TRH release (16, 34, 53, 54). Thus it seems unlikely that hypocretin deficiency per se inhibits TRH secretion to reduce TSH levels in narcoleptic humans..

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	61	We (22) previously showed that circulating leptin levels are 50% lower in narcoleptic patients than in controls matched for age and body fat mass. Here, we show that circulating leptin levels and TSH secretion rates are correlated positively in narcoleptic men. Other studies have revealed that leptin is intimately involved in the regulation of the HPT axis. Specifically, a reduction of circulating leptin mediates the inhibition of HPT axis activity during starvation (13). Leptin acts primarily to integrate the activities of neuronal circuits that orchestrate energy balance (40). In this context, leptin activates -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), whereas it inhibits neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). TRH neurons receive functional inputs from all of these neurotransmitters (10 to 12, 25, 26, 57): NPY/AgRP inhibit TRH release (21), whereas -MSH/CART promote TRH secretion (11, 21). In addition, leptin can directly stimulate prepro-TRH mRNA synthesis and processing and promote TRH release via activation of leptin receptors on TRH neurons (37). Moreover, the fact that leptin and leptin receptors are expressed in rodent anterior pituitary cells suggests that leptin may also impact TSH secretion directly (19). Diurnal pulsatile leptin and TSH levels exhibit strong pattern synchrony in healthy humans, whereas TSH release gets disorganized and its circadian rhythm phase shifted in leptin deficient human subjects (31). In the present study, we also demonstrate strong pattern synchrony between leptin and TSH both in patients and in controls. These data clearly suggest that leptin is involved in the regulation of TSH release in rodents and humans. Thus the fact that TSH release rates were positively correlated with circulating leptin levels in the present study supports, but certainly does not prove, the contention that hypoleptinemia blunts TSH secretion in narcoleptic patients..

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	63	Diminished dopaminergic tone may also blunt TSH secretion in narcoleptic subjects through diminution of TRH release. Studies using the canine model of narcolepsy suggest that hypoactivity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic circuits are among the major pathophysiological mechanisms in narcolepsy (38). Recent in vivo brain imaging studies in humans support this notion (9), and the disease is currently treated symptomatically with drugs that enhance monoaminergic (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine) neurotransmissions (38). In vitro and in vivo studies clearly show that hypocretin peptides stimulate dopaminergic neurons in various brain sites (16, 36), which also suggests that hypocretin deficiency may silence dopaminergic circuits. Dopamine promotes TRH release via hypothalamic dopamine D2 receptors (27). Therefore, hypocretin deficiency may blunt TRH (and thereby TSH) release through diminution of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the hypothalamus. However, the role of dopamine in the regulation of TSH secretion is complex, in view of the fact the this monoamine inhibits TSH release at the level of the pituitary (6, 14). This observation implies that reduced dopaminergic tone would lead to an increase of circulating TSH in narcoleptic subjects. In this context, it seems important to mention that prolactin secretion, which is also controlled by dopamine at the pituitary level, is not altered in narcoleptic patients (S. W. Kok, unpublished observation). Thus the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of low plasma TSH levels in narcoleptic humans remains uncertain..

TRH receptors are distributed widely in the CNS (15), and TRH has diverse neuromodulating actions (15, 48). Among many other features, it has CNS-stimulant and -antidepressant effects (18, 29). Interestingly, chronic administration of a TRH analog increases wakefulness and ameliorates cataplexy in narcoleptic dogs (50), which may imply that diminished TRH tone is involved in the pathogenesis of these narcoleptic symptoms. However, the fact that circulating prolactin levels are normal in narcoleptic humans (unpublished observation) argues against (but does not exclude) a primary TRH deficiency in these patients, as TRH is involved in the regulation of prolactin release..

The underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms are not known. In the present study, sleep and plasma TSH levels were inversely associated, and sleep periods were invariably followed by a reduction of TSH concentration in both patients and controls, suggesting that hypocretins are not involved in the coupling of sleep and TSH release. The present data also suggest that the fact that patients slept longer than controls may have contributed to the reduction of their TSH levels..

Despite the fact that TSH levels were reduced in narcoleptic subjects, plasma T4 and T3 concentrations were similar to those in healthy controls and completely within the normal range. This may imply that the thyroid is more sensitive to TSH stimulation in narcoleptics (unfortunately, our study does not yield further data to support this notion). Thyroid hypersensitivity to TSH may be brought about by the reduction of sympathetic tone in these patients (55), as TSH-induced T4 release is inhibited by 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation (30, 35). This putative resetting of the pituitary-thyroid axis could fully explain our observations. In any case, the fact that thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range in narcoleptics indicates that these patients are euthyroid. However, it remains to be established whether the ensemble acts appropriately under conditions of greater metabolic demands, such as growth, cold adaptation, or pregnancy..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	4	Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder caused by impaired hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission. Growth hormone (GH) secretion may be altered in narcolepsy for various reasons. Slow-wave sleep episodes, which are closely associated with GH-secretory events, are more randomly dispersed over 24 h in narcoleptics. Furthermore, hypocretins may inhibit pituitary GH release. We assessed the function of the somatotropic axis in narcolepsy by deconvolving 24-h (10-min sampling interval) plasma GH concentration profiles in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic patients and in seven healthy controls matched for age, sex, and body weight. Both basal and pulsatile GH secretion rate and secretagogue-induced GH release were similar in patients and controls. However, narcoleptics secreted ~50% of their total production during the daytime, whereas controls secreted only 25% during the day. Also, the GH output pattern of narcoleptics was significantly less regular. We propose that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian distribution of hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone release in narcoleptic patients to simultaneously cause daytime GH release and promote their propensity to fall asleep during the day..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	7	NARCOLEPSY PRIMARILY AFFECTS the organization and regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Its main symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and fragmented nocturnal sleep (20). Narcolepsy is caused by disruption of hypocretin (orexin)-mediated neurotransmission (7, 16, 21). The vast majority of human patients lack hypocretin in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17, 18, 28). An autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypocretin neurons is currently presumed to be the principal cause of narcolepsy in humans (21, 30)..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	9	Sleep and the activity of the somatotropic axis are intimately related (33). In particular, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is associated with pituitary growth hormone (GH) release. In healthy individuals, a major GH-secretory event occurs often shortly after sleep onset, in close temporal association with the first period of SWS. Conversely, sleep deprivation is consistently associated with a reduction of circulating GH levels, and the age-related decline of SWS is accompanied by a marked decrease of GH secretion (32)..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	13	Only a limited number of studies have assessed the status of the somatotropic axis in narcoleptic humans. In general, these studies have suggested that the rise of plasma GH concentrations around sleep onset is markedly dampened or even absent in narcolepsy (2, 8, 15). It was hypothesized that an intrinsic disturbance of SWS and/or the frequent occurrence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods underlies these alterations in GH secretion in narcoleptic humans (33). However, the interpretation of data obtained in these early studies was hampered by methodological imperfections, particularly with respect to the selection of control subjects [e.g., not matched for age and/or body mass index (BMI)]. Moreover, in the course of time, novel analytical techniques [deconvolution and approximate entropy (ApEn)] have been developed, which allow estimation of the pituitary GH secretion rate and quantification of the orderliness of the release process on the basis of frequently sampled plasma GH concentration time series (24, 34, 38)..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	18	Subjects. We included seven male patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology. A physician experienced with narcolepsy (G. J. Lammers) made the clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy. The diagnosis was confirmed by Multiple Sleep Latency Testing, which showed results typical for narcolepsy (1). All patients were HLA-DQB1*0602 positive. We confirmed that all patients were hypocretin deficient: hypocretin-1 was undetectable in the CSF with direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (28). The subjects, except three (two using psychostimulants, and one using clomipramine), who discontinued their medication for 2 wk before the study, were free of medication..

Subjects were admitted to the CRC and prepared for sleep registration. During the 24-h study occasion, three standardized meals were served, at 0900, 1300, and 1800 (Nutridrink 1.5 kcal/ml, 1500-1800 kcal/day; macronutrient composition per 100 ml: 5 g protein, 6.5 g fat, 17.9 g carbohydrate; Nutricia, Zoetermeer, Netherlands). Subjects remained sedentary throughout the study except for bathroom visits. Lights were switched off at 2300..
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	27	An intravenous cannula was inserted in an antecubital vein 1 h before the start of blood sampling. Blood samples were taken from a three-way stopcock attached to an extended line to prevent sleep disturbances by manipulations of the investigators. The catheter was kept patent by a 0.9% NaCl and heparin (1 U/ml) drip (500 ml/24 h). Blood was collected in S-monovetten tubes (Sarstedt, Etten-Leur, Netherlands) at 10-min intervals for 24 h, allowed to clot, centrifuged at 4 degrees C for 20 min within an hour of collection, and serum frozen at 20 degrees C until assays were performed. Serum IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations were measured only once in an early morning sample..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	30	Assays. Serum GH concentrations were measured using a sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The assay is specific for the 22-kDa GH isoform. Human biosynthetic GH (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) diluted in bovine calf serum was used as a standard, which was calibrated against the World Health Organization First International Reference Preparation 80-505 (1  microg = 2.6 mU). The detection limit of the assay (defined as the value 2 SD above the mean value of the zero standard) was 0.03 mU/l. The interassay coefficients of variation varied from 2.7 to 8.2% over a GH concentration range of 0.1-100 mU/l. All samples from one subject were measured in the same assay. Total serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations were measured by RIA as previously described (23)..
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	31	Sleep recording and analysis. During the 24-h sampling procedure, sleep was recorded polygraphically using a Porti-5 ambulant electroencephalogram recording system (Twente Medical Systems International, Enschede, Netherlands) and scored on EEG-2100 review software (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). An experienced technician, blinded for the subject under study, visually scored the sleep recordings at 30-s epochs by means of standardized criteria (27). Nocturnal sleep onset was identified as the first epoch of stages II, III, IV, or REM sleep after lights off, provided that the subsequent interval was not scored as wake. The sleep period was defined as the time between sleep onset and final awakening in the morning. Sleep efficiency was calculated as the percentage of the sleep period actually spent asleep..
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	32	Data analysis. For the GH time series, we used multiple-parameter deconvolution analysis to estimate various specific measures of pulsatile secretion and half-life on the basis of simultaneous consideration of all serum hormone concentrations and their dose-dependent intrasample variances (35, 37). Results are expressed as milliunits per liter of distribution volume (mU/lD). The following parameters were estimated in the GH series: number of secretory bursts, secretory burst half-duration (duration at half-maximal amplitude), burst amplitude, mean mass secreted per burst, hormone half-life, pulsatile secretion rate, basal secretion rate, and total secretion per 24 h. Furthermore, we quantified the amount of GH secreted from 0900 to 2300 and from 2300 to 0900 during the 3 h before and after sleep onset and during the first secretory burst after sleep onset..
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	33	We quantified the minute-to-minute regularity ("serial orderliness") of GH secretion by use of the ApEn statistic, a scale- and model-independent metric (24). ApEn estimates the regularity of subordinate (nonpulsatile) patterns in the data and as such yields information complementary to deconvolution techniques (25, 39). Greater regularity yields smaller ApEn values, whereas greater independence among sequential values of a time series yields larger ApEn values. We applied normalized ApEn parameters of m = 1 and r = 20% of the intraseries SD, as previously validated for GH series of this length (26). The ApEn ratio delineates the orderliness of a concentration time series compared with the ApEn score associated with maximal randomness in the same time series as estimated by computer simulation. Thus an ApEn ratio equal to 1 reflects maximal randomness in the time series under study, and smaller ApEn ratios denote greater regularity..

The duration of the sleep period did not differ between patients (405  plus or minus  30 min) and controls (383  plus or minus  41 min, P = 0.67). Both groups had a relatively low sleep efficiency (narcolepsy: 64  plus or minus  6.4%; controls: 72  plus or minus  4.9%, P = 0.41), resulting in 263  plus or minus  32 min of nocturnal sleep in the patients and 274  plus or minus  36 min in the controls (P = 0.82). However, the relative amount of nocturnal stage I sleep was 50% higher in narcoleptics (21.8  plus or minus  2.5 vs. 14.5  plus or minus  1.7%, P = 0.04), which suggests that they had more fragmented nocturnal sleep. The amount of SWS during the night did not differ between patients and controls (25.1  plus or minus  9.3 vs. 22.4  plus or minus  6.9 min, P = 0.82). None of the control subjects slept during the daytime. In contrast, all narcoleptics took at least two daytime naps (average 3.3 naps). An average of 14.8  plus or minus  6.1 min of these daytime sleep episodes were spent in SWS, and 40.4  plus or minus  4.1 min were spent in REM sleep..

Consequently, the total production of GH was not different in the two groups (Fig. 2). However, the distribution of GH-secretory events over 24 h differed considerably between groups. Narcoleptics secreted almost one-half of their total pulsatile production during the day, whereas controls produced only one-quarter during the day (pulsatile release during daytime as a fraction of total pulsatile release: 0.48  plus or minus  0.05 vs. 0.26  plus or minus  0.05, respectively, P = 0.01)..

Total daily GH production was strongly correlated with the total time of SWS in narcoleptic patients and controls alike (Fig. 3). As a result, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and (slow-wave) sleep epochs over 24 h was altered concomitantly in narcoleptics such that they secreted a larger fraction of their total GH production during the day (48 vs. 26% in controls).

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	61	Only a few previous studies have examined plasma GH concentrations in patients with narcolepsy. The results of these studies generally suggested that GH release (both spontaneous 24-h and secretagogue-induced) is blunted in narcoleptics (2, 8, 15). However, interpretation of the data obtained in these studies is hampered by potential imperfections regarding the selection of control subjects. For example, in two of the studies (2, 15), body weight of the participants was not reported, and a third study (8) did not include healthy control subjects at all. We now know that narcoleptic patients tend to be obese (9) and that GH production is profoundly reduced in (abdominally) obese humans (23, 36). Also, age was reported in only two studies (2, 15). In one of these (15), the narcoleptic patients were ~10 yr older than the controls (32 vs. 24 yr), which may also have biased the results (32). In the present study, the control subjects were carefully matched with respect to age, sex, BMI, and body fat distribution to preclude analogous bias. Therefore, we believe that the data presented in the present paper are more conclusive than any previous study as to whether narcolepsy per se impacts GH secretion. Moreover, the narcoleptic patients in the present study were confirmed to be hypocretin deficient, which was not possible to determine in any of the previous studies (as hypocretin peptides were unknown at that time). Thus the present data pertain specifically to hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans. Our results clearly argue against a reduction of spontaneous or secretagogue-induced GH secretion in human narcolepsy..

First, the onset of nocturnal sleep remains an important correlate of GH release, even when numerous naps have interrupted daytime wakefulness. Both in narcoleptics and in controls, ~30% of total daily GH secretion occurred in the 3 h after nocturnal sleep onset. Second, the relationship between SWS and GH release remains robust, even if sleep is fragmented and more randomly dispersed over 24 h. A strong, positive, and highly significant correlation between both variables was observed in narcoleptics and in controls. Third, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and sleep epochs over 24 h appears to be altered analogously in narcoleptic patients: they had more (slow-wave) sleep time and more GH secretion during the day.

Hypocretin neurons connect with other nuclei within the hypothalamus (including the arcuate nucleus) and the pituitary (22) to explain their impact on energy balance and several neuroendocrine ensembles (for reviews, see Refs. 20 and 41). Intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 causes a dose-dependent decrease of plasma GH in rats (13). Furthermore, it was recently reported that somatotropic cells in the human pituitary express the hypocretin receptor-1 (4). These data suggest that hypocretins directly blunt GH secretion. We therefore hypothesized that hypocretin deficiency would enhance total daily GH production in narcoleptic humans. Our results do not support this contention, as narcoleptic patients produced normal total amounts of GH (Fig. 2). However, we do believe that our data support the thesis that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian dispersion of hypothalamic GHRH release, which normally confines sleep and GH secretion to the night..

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	67	Sleep and the activity of the somatotropic axis are intimately related (33). The most reproducible GH-secretory event in humans occurs around nocturnal sleep onset, in close temporal association with the first epoch of SWS (see Ref. 33). The secretion of GH is controlled mainly by two hypothalamic peptides, GHRH and somatostatin (12, 14). A large body of evidence suggests that GHRH simultaneously promotes sleep and GH release, which can explain the consistent association between sleep and GH secretion (see Ref. 19 and references therein). The present study shows that this dual regulatory effect of GHRH is probably intact in narcoleptics, as SWS and GH release remain closely associated in these patients (Fig. 3). This inference may imply that the circadian distribution of hypothalamic GHRH release is disrupted in narcolepsy to simultaneously cause diurnal GH secretion and enhance daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the hypocretin system, which is particularly active during the day (11), may normally inhibit hypothalamic GHRH secretion to promote arousal and reduce pituitary GH output. Conversely, diminution of hypocretin tonus at night (11) may relax inhibitory restraint of GHRH release to dampen arousal and increase GH output. In this scenario, hypocretin deficiency particularly enhances GHRH release during the day (when the system normally has its peak activity) to concurrently promote daytime GH secretion and compromise daytime wakefulness in narcoleptic patients..

The serial orderliness of pulsatile GH release, as determined by the ApEn statistic, reflects the balance of feedforward and feedback inputs into the somatotropic neuroendocrine ensemble (40). In the present study, GH output was more irregular in narcoleptic patients than in their healthy controls, which suggests that negative feedback restraint of somatotropic activity is muted and/or that positive feedforward inputs are enhanced in narcolepsy (40)..

In addition, the circadian dispersion of GH-secretory events is altered in narcoleptics, so that a relatively large fraction of total production occurs during the daytime. We propose that an altered circadian distribution of GHRH release, brought about by hypocretin deficiency, simultaneously causes increased daytime GH secretion and enhanced daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy..
