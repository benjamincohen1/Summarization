0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	6	Neurons in the LHA synthesize peptidergic transmitters that stimulate feeding behavior, specifically melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) (7) and the orexins (A and B), which are also termed hypocretins (8, 9).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	7	 MCH is expressed predominately in the LHA (10, 11), and several lines of investigation implicate it as a key regulator of food intake and body weight (7, 12, 13, 14).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	8	 First, MCH gene expression is influenced by changes in energy balance.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The adipocyte hormone leptin inhibits MCH gene expression, and food restriction increases MCH gene expression (15).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Second, intracerebroventricular administration of exogenous MCH stimulates food intake (7, 13, 14), and mice that overexpress MCH are obese and insulin resistant (13).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Finally, mice with targeted disruption of the MCH gene have reduced food intake and body weight accompanied by increased metabolic rate, resulting in little or no body fat (15).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	12	The orexin or hypocretin system (8, 9) is comprised of two peptides, termed orexin-A and orexin-B, and two associated receptors.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Intraventricular administration of a neutralizing antiorexin antibody suppresses spontaneous feeding in fasted rats (16), and intraventricular administration of orexin-A dose-dependently stimulates food consumption (9, 16, 17, 18).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Changes in feeding after the administration of orexin-B have been inconsistent (9, 17, 18), such that a stronger case can be made for a role of orexin-A in energy homeostasis.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although orexin- and MCH-expressing neurons are made within different neurons in the LHA (19, 20), both peptides increase energy intake.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this regard they are similar to agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptides made in the same population of neurons within the arcuate nucleus.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Both NPY and AgRP, when administered exogenously, increase food intake (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	18	 As axons from the LHA project to the medial hypothalamus, including the arcuate, and as the AgRP/NPY neurons in the arcuate project to the LHA (27, 28, 29), understanding the functional interactions among these peptides is important.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	19	 NPY- and AgRP-induced increases in food intake are dependent on opioid receptor activation, as this action is blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (30, 31).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Activation of the opioid system, in turn, has been associated with increased intake of preferred, high fat-containing diets (32).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Consistent with this, we found that AgRP selectively increases the intake of a high fat diet when rats have simultaneous access to two diets differing in their relative amounts of carbohydrate and fat (31).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	22	 On the other hand, administration of NPY reportedly increases the consumption of high carbohydrate diets (33, 34), although this has been attributed to a stimulation of whichever diet an individual rat prefers (35, 36).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether the orexigenic action of MCH and orexin-A depends upon activity at opioid receptors, and whether these peptides influence diet selection.

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, the same dose when administered in conjunction with i3vt AgRP reliably reduced the increase in food intake elicited by AgRP (31).

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups (n = 8 or 9/group) matched by preexperimental body weight and food intake.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	39	 On the test day, food was removed 2 h before lights off.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Thirty minutes before lights off, rats in two groups received an ip injection of 0.

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Ten minutes later, one naloxone and one saline group received an i3vt injection of 1 nmol AgRP/2  microl, and the other two groups received saline (2  microl).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This dose of AgRP elicits a reliable and long-lasting increase in food intake (25, 26, 38).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Five minutes before lights off, food was returned to the cages, and intake was measured after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Water was available at all times.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This experiment paralleled experiment 1, except that MCH was used instead of AgRP.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Body weight-matched rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups (n = 8 or 9/group).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	48	 On the test day, half the rats received an ip injection of 0.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	49	3 mg/kg NALX, and half received saline; 10 min later half of each group received an i3vt injection of MCH or saline (5  microg in a 2- microl vol or saline in a 2- microl vol.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Because it has been observed that MCH is more effective at increasing food intake during the light than during the dark period (14), experiment 2 was repeated in the same animals 10 d later, except that the first injection occurred 7 h into the light phase.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The animals were counterbalanced for their previous treatment and reassigned to one of four new groups: ip NALX or saline, and i3vt MCH or saline.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Because orexin-A is more effective at increasing food intake during the light than during the dark period (18), this experiment paralleled experiment 2 in every way, except that orexin-A (3 ng/2  microl/rat) was substituted for MCH.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	53	 A group of rats (n = 20) was adapted to having two diets (HF and LF) simultaneously available ad libitum in separate food hoppers on their cages for 1 month.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	54	 They were then matched by average daily food intake and body weight and assigned to one of two groups, receiving either saline or 5  microg MCH i3vt in a 2- microl injection volume following the same paradigm as that described above for experiment 3.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This experiment paralleled experiment 5, except that rats received either saline or 3 ng orexin-A i3vt in 2  microl.

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	99	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that with regard to energy homeostasis, AgRP and orexin-A share a common underlying mechanism, whereas MCH acts through a different mechanism.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The opioid system has long been implicated in the regulation of food intake, with increased opioid activity in the brain leading to increased caloric consumption (30, 39, 40, 41).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In particular, opioids modulate the incentive value of food, with opioid agonists increasing and opioid antagonists decreasing it (30, 40, 42).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Consistent with this, opioids alter the relative selection of, or preference for, specific foods.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	103	 ss-Endorphin, for example, increases intake of a preferred HF diet (43, 44).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Likewise, in the present experiments orexin-A selectively increased consumption of a preferred HF diet, and orexin-A-stimulated intake of pelleted chow was attenuated by the prior administration of naloxone.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Hence, we conclude that orexin-A, like AgRP, uses opioid-mediated circuits for its orexigenic action.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In contrast, a comparably orexigenic dose of MCH did not alter diet selection, and an MCH-elicited increase in pelleted chow was not influenced by naloxone.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	107	 We therefore conclude that the opioid system is not a downstream mediator of MCH s orexigenic action.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	108	Considerable controversy surrounds the contention that macronutrient intake is selectively regulated by different central nervous system systems (45), including the opioids (42, 46, 47).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	109	 As an example, when a drug or other treatment is given, it cannot easily be ascertained whether an increase (or decrease) in one particular food choice relative to another reflects a preference (aversion) for a specific macronutrient (e.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	110	 carbohydrate) or whether it reflects a magnified (minimized) preexisting preference based upon palatability (48).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Regardless of the actual mechanism, the critical observation is that orexin-A and MCH influence food intake via distinct mechanisms that can be dissociated by use of opioid antagonists and/or by considering food selection.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Because AgRP s orexigenic action is also reduced by naloxone, and because AgRP selectively increases intake of the preferred HF diet (31), we conclude that orexin-A and AgRP act through a common mechanism.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Recent data from our laboratory (49, 50) and others (51) indicate that an orexigenic dose of AgRP increases Fos activity in the LHA, and dual label immunohistochemistry indicates that the increased activity is in orexin-A-producing neurons.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Importantly, AgRP does not increase Fos activity in MCH-producing neurons (50, 51).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Hence, functional anatomical data are consistent with the pharmacological and behavioral data.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	116	AgRP is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors (27), and these are found in the LHA as well as other projection sites of the NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus (20, 29).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The present data do not allow determination of whether AgRP stimulates orexin-A neurons, and these, in turn, stimulate food intake by acting via opioid receptors.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Additionally, these data do not determine whether the pathway is orexin-A to AgRP to opioid circuits, or whether other relay sites are involved that integrate information from both AgRP and orexin-A inputs.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Added to this are the facts that AgRP neurons in the arcuate cosynthesize NPY, and NPY-elicited food intake is also naloxone dependent.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Hence, NPY, AgRP, and orexin-A all appear to share a common circuit at some point.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	121	Over the last several years, the number of identified peptides that are involved in the control of food intake and energy balance has grown enormously.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Much of this growth has been fueled by the application of sophisticated molecular biological approaches and the pressing clinical need to treat the exponential growth in obesity.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	123	 To develop appropriate therapeutic strategies, however, this "alphabet soup" of peptides and transmitters will need to be organized into functional circuits.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The identification of such functional circuits will depend on intensive efforts to delineate both the neuroanatomical relationship among these systems as well as their functional interactions.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The present results demonstrate that two peptides located within a single hypothalamic subarea, peptides that appear to be regulated similarly by energy balance and that each stimulate food intake, act via distinct behavioral and neural mechanisms.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Such results point to the complexity of a homeostatic system that was designed to do much more than regulate the intake of a rat with ad libitum access to a single caloric source.

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The first described and most potent genetic influence known to affect susceptibility to autoimmune thyroiditis, however, is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The association between MHC and autoimmunity was originally reported in 1971, first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (4) and then in mice with experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (5).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	10	The MHC is located on the short arm of the human chromosome 6, spanning 3.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	11	6 megabases of complete and annotated DNA sequence (6).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Its main functions are to guide the intracellular processing of antigens and to display antigenic peptides on the plasma membrane for recognition by T lymphocytes (7).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is the most gene-dense region of the genome, containing 224 loci (96 pseudogenes and 128 expressed genes) grouped in three classes.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Class II MHC genes are constitutively expressed only on hematopoietic cells involved in antigen presentation (dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and cortical thymic epithelial cells) but can be induced by inflammatory stimuli on many other cell types (such as endothelial cells, hepatocytes, ss-cells of the pancreas, and thyrocytes).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Little is known about the biological significance of this observation, although it has been implicated in allograft rejection (8) and subsequently in autoimmunity.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this field, Bottazzo and Feldman hypothesized that class II MHC molecules, when aberrantly expressed on epithelial cells, confer to them antigen-presenting functions favoring the initiation of autoimmune diseases (9, 10).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	17	The MHC is also the region that has been associated with the greatest number of human diseases, ranging from narcolepsy (11) to primary immunodeficiencies (12) to most, if not all, autoimmune conditions (13, 14).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The strength of this association, which is classically measured by relative risks (RR) or odds ratios, varies from low, such as a RR of 2.

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	20	 For Graves  disease, the MHC (DR3) association is mild, with RRs ranging from 1.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For Hashimoto s thyroiditis, the contribution of MHC haplotypes to disease is less definitive, although they may play a role in the familial clustering of thyroiditis and diabetes (19).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	22	Given the biological plausibility, the replication of the findings, and the strength of many of these associations, MHC molecules are considered in the causal pathway that leads to autoimmune disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	23	 There are, however, important factors that could confound the above-described association.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	24	 First, MHC loci are found together at frequencies much higher than would be expected by random combination of their frequencies in the population.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	25	 It is thus possible that the genes causing disease are not the MHC genes per se but rather genes that travel with the MHC.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For example, polymorphisms of the LMP2 and LMP7 genes, which are embedded within the class II region, have been associated with ankylosing spondylitis (20).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, the same allele that is associated with a particular disease is also common in the normal, unaffected population, and actually the majority of patients with the susceptible allele do not develop autoimmune disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, it is unknown whether to initiate autoimmunity MHC molecules have to be expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells within secondary lymphoid organs or rather on nonhematopoietic cells of the target organ itself, such as the thyroid follicular cell in the case of autoimmune thyroiditis.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	29	To investigate whether MHC class II molecules when expressed on thyrocytes play a causal role in autoimmune thyroiditis, we developed transgenic mice that express specifically in the thyroid gland the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of the MHC class II pathway (21, 22).

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	6	Given that ASP is not normally found in the CNS, a role for ASP in regulating MC receptor signaling in the brain is unlikely.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, a homolog of ASP termed agouti-related protein (AgRP) is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in a population of neurons adjacent, but not overlapping, with neurons that produce -MSH (7, 8, 9).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	8	 AgRP acts as an antagonist at the MC3 and MC4 receptors (7, 10).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Hence, AgRP opposes the actions of -MSH.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Consistent with this, AgRP and the -MSH precursor, proopiomelanocortin, are regulated in opposite directions by energy balance and leptin.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Food deprivation decreases proopiomelanocortin gene expression, whereas it increases AgRP gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (11, 12, 13).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Overexpression of AgRP results in an obese phenotype similar to that of mice that overexpress ASP (10).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	13	When a biologically active fragment of AgRP is administered into the third ventricle (i3vt) of rats, the increase of food intake lasts for up to 6 d (14, 15).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although the short-term effects of AgRP seem to depend on antagonism at the identified MC receptors, the long-term effects do not (14).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Moreover, like neuropeptide Y (NPY), the orexigenic effect of AgRP can be blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (16, 17).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, the potent effects of AgRP to increase food intake depend critically on activation of opioid receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Opioid receptors come in three identified subtypes:  micro, , and (18); and of these, both  micro and have been strongly implicated in the control of food intake (19).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, the aim of these experiments was to assess the role of these specific opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP to increase food intake.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	28	 NorBNI has been widely used as a selective antagonist for -opioid receptors (20, 21), and ss-FNA has been widely used as a selective  micro-opioid receptor antagonist (18, 22).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The selective antagonist action of ss-FNA has a unique time course, becoming more selective for this action over an apparent 20 h after administration (23).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, for all of the experiments, ss-FNA is actually administered 20 h before food intake measurements.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For the remaining 22 h, the rats had access to pelleted laboratory chow (Harlan-Teklad, Indianapolis, IN).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This paradigm was used because it produces very reliable 2-h intakes and because both AgRP and the ligands of the opioid receptors potently influence intake of a preferred HF diet more than other diets (24).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Consequently, if opioids are important in mediating the effects of AgRP, it is more likely to be observed during HF feeding than alternative paradigms.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Microinjection experiments have identified numerous sites, at every level of the neuroaxis, in which opioid agonist and antagonists affect food intake (for review, see Ref.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In particular, whereas opioid agonists and antagonists increase and decrease food intake, respectively, they also influence food choice.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Both - and  micro- selective antagonists have been found to decrease intake of an HF diet to a greater extent than they decrease intake of a high-carbohydrate diet (31).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Controversy exists, however, as to whether the effect of opioids is to alter the animal s choice of macronutrients or simply to drive the organism to consume more of an already preferred food (32).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Regardless of the interpretation, this is consistent with an important role for these opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Similar to what occurs after manipulation of opioid receptor signaling, administration of AgRP selectively increases intake of a preferred HF diet (17).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Additionally, stimulation of  micro-receptors in the nucleus accumbens preferentially enhances HF feeding (33).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Such strong parallels between AgRP and opioid receptor ligands on food intake and food selection strengthen the hypothesis that these two systems interact in an important way to influence food intake and food choice.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	134	The opioid system encompasses a number of distributed receptor populations as well as a number of endogenous ligands for those receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In these experiments, the opioid receptor antagonists were delivered into the third ventricle and, hence, close to the hypothalamus.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, given the lipophyllic nature of these compounds and the rostral- to-caudal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system, it is likely that these antagonists could interact with opioid receptors in a variety of neuroanatomical sites (34).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Although these experiments, therefore, cannot determine the exact location of the critical  micro- and -opioid receptors, some clues can be derived from the areas that show increases in fos-like-immunoreactivity after third-ventricular administration of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Two hours after AgRP administration, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, and paraventricular and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	139	 After 24 h, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus of the solitary tract (35).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	140	 All of these regions show evidence for  micro- or -receptor binding and/or expression, but only the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral hypothalamus show high levels of binding for both receptors (33, 36, 37).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Future research will need to address whether the activation of either  micro- or -receptor subtypes sufficient to produce AgRP s effects is in the same neuroanatomical sites or occurs as a result of activation in disparate sites.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	142	A separate (but related) question is which endogenous opioid ligand or ligands that are blocked by the specific receptor antagonists have increased release after AgRP administration.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The search for specific functions of opioid ligands has been hampered by the fact that they all interact with multiple subtypes of opioid receptors (20, 38) and the recent demonstration that opioid receptor subtypes can make heterodimers (39).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Nevertheless, both ss-endorphin and dynorphin have high affinity for both  micro- and -opioid receptors (40, 41, 42), and ss-endorphin is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (43), in cells that have been hypothesized to express the MC3 receptor (44, 45) and in the nucleus of the solitary tract in a region of high MC4 receptor expression.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Thus, it is possible that AgRP given into the third ventricle could exert direct effects on one or both of these ss-endorphin populations.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Food intake stimulated by ss- endorphin can be significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by pretreatment with either the  micro- or the -selective antagonists (46, 47).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	147	 (47), because the antagonists only worked at high equimolar doses, relative to ss-FNA, it is conceivable that they could be exerting their effects through multiple (rather than specific) opioid receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Because none of the antagonist doses used in the Silva study completely eliminated the ss-endorphin-induced feeding, they proposed that, analogous to our findings with AgRP, blockade of multiple opioid receptors might be necessary to produce this effect.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Dynorphin is made both in the paraventricular nucleus and lateral area of the hypothalamus, and both regions express high levels of the MC4 receptor (48).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Both our group and Berthoud and colleagues (35) have shown that the AgRP-induced fos in the lateral hypothalamus is colocalized with orexin-A immunoreactivity.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Because dynorphin is heavily colocalized with orexin-A in the lateral hypothalamus (49), this provides direct evidence that AgRP can activate dynorphin-containing neurons.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Use of either mice with targeted deletion of ss-endorphin (50, 51) or dynorphin could clarify the role of these two opioid peptides in the orexigenic actions of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	153	The exact role of the opioid system in the control of food intake remains uncertain.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Given its large number of different receptors and ligands, however, it is likely that its role is not one-dimensional and, rather, encompasses a number of aspects of ingestive behavior (19).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The present data point to a specific role for  micro- and -opioid receptors in mediating effects of the hypothalamic MC system.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This intimate relationship with the MC system points to the long-term regulation of energy balance as one of the important roles played by the opioid system.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Future research will need to address the functional interactions of the opioid system with hypothalamic peptides and also explore the potential involvement of the opioid system in the etiology and treatment of disorders of energy-balance regulation, such as obesity.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	10	Method In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, 19 patients received either modafinil (100 mg) or placebo prior to undertaking a working memory task with functional magnetic resonance imaging.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Modafinil administration was associated with significantly greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex during the working memory task.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The anterior cingulate cortex signal correlated with cognitive performance, although only a subset of patients exhibited `enhancement'.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	14	Conclusions Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	25	 On each day, patients received oral modafinil (100 mg) or placebo 2 h prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Administration and scanning times were predicated on the drug's pharmacokinetics in humans; peak plasma levels occur 2-4 h post-acute oral dosing (Cephalon, 1999; Robertson  and  Hellriegel, 2003).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Randomisation, performed by a pharmacist (not a member of the research team), was achieved by drawing labelled counters; this ensured that approximately equivalent numbers of patients received modafinil and placebo on day 1, and vice versa on day 2.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The outcome measures were: a difference in fMRI signal, during a working memory task, between the modafinil and placebo conditions; a difference in behavioural performance (accuracy), during the same intra-scanner task, between modafinil and placebo conditions; and a patient-wise bivariate correlation between the first two measures.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	31	Psychological paradigm Inside the scanner, patients performed a standard working memory task (the `2-back'; Callicott et al, 1998).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This difficult task required subjects to monitor, update and temporally `tag' the contents of their working memory (Manoach, 2003).

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Some have incorporated a wide range of accuracy among patients with schizophrenia (Callicott et al, 1998, where performance was relatively poor; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 2001; Bertolino et al, 2003) whereas others have set more stringent thresholds (Callicott et al, 2000, 2003).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Comparison with a healthy control group necessarily requires comparable levels of performance across the groups, but in our study we wished to compare patients' performances against themselves (on and off modafinil).

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	100	 However, this correlation did not reflect a straightforward relationship between improved activation and improved performance.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Rather, it reflected an increased fMRI signal in the majority of patients during the modafinil session, with concomitant improvement of memory performance in half and a decreased signal in a minority of patients (in response to modafinil), most of whom exhibited reduced performance on the drug (Fig.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	108	  Post hoc examination of the data revealed that of the five patients exhibiting improvements of both anterior cingulate cortex fMRI signal and 2-back performance, four were receiving `typical' neuroleptics (depot or sulpiride) and one was receiving olanzapine.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	109	 That is, of five patients who received `typicals' the majority responded positively to modafinil (both physiologically and cognitively).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Conversely, of 12 patients receiving `atypicals' only one exhibited this pattern.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Moreover, a post hoc analysis confirmed that the positive correlation between anterior cingulate cortex signal and performance change was most significant in the five patients receiving `typical' antipsychotics (Spearman's =1.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Conversely, when these patients were excluded from the group analysis, the latter was no longer significant (for 12 patients receiving `atypicals', =0.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Exclusion of those subjects whose performance was at the level of chance on placebo led to exclusion of three of the four subjects receiving depots and a reduction of the anterior cingulate cortex/performance correlation to trend significance (=0.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Hence, it is possible that those receiving depot medication derived the greatest benefit from modafinil (perhaps as a consequence of greater initial deficit) and contributed most to the findings.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	115	We further investigated this post hoc `deficit/benefit' hypothesis and found that those exhibiting improved working memory performance on modafinil had demonstrated significantly worse performance on a verbal fluency task at initial assessment compared with other patients.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	117	 There were no correlations between intra-scanner working memory task performance and specific symptom ratings.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	118	Finally, by way of validating our sample against those described in successive reports, which have repeatedly described positive correlations between 2-back accuracy and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in people with schizophrenia compared with `normals' (Callicott et al, 1999, 2000), we examined the correlates of performance per se on the 2-back task.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	119	 We found the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex implicated under both conditions (placebo; x=44 mm, y=41 mm, z=9 mm, 21 voxels, Z=2.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	120	01, uncorrected, for height of activation; modafinil: x=44 mm, y=49 mm, z=18 mm, 62 voxels, Z=3.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	121	01, uncorrected, for height of activation).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	122	Cognitive response Despite enhanced anterior cingulate cortex activation at the group level (during working memory performance), most of our patients did not exhibit enhanced cognition.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	123	 For the group as a whole there was no effect of modafinil upon working memory (on this protocol).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Therefore it might be posited that increased anterior cingulate cortex activation is either unrelated to cognition or indicative of reduced efficiency of cognitive processing (Callicott et al, 2000; Manoach, 2003).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	125	 If greater anterior cingulate cortex activation occurs without an increase in cognitive performance then brain function might be said to be less efficient in the presence of modafinil.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, it is important to note that cognitive function did improve in a minority of patients, and that although it might be posited that this is to be expected statistically (as merely a manifestation of variation around the mean), there is a feature of the data that runs counter to this interpretation.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This is the positive correlation between anterior cingulate cortex activation and cognitive improvement (Fig.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	128	 If modafinil simply made anterior cingulate cortex function less efficient, then we should expect such a correlation to be negative.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The positive correlation implies that the magnitude of anterior cingulate cortex activation and cognitive performance are indeed related in the context of modafinil exposure; those exhibiting the greater anterior cingulate cortex response also exhibit the greater cognitive enhancement (of working memory).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	130	Accounting for `responders' It is of interest that those exhibiting greater physiological and cognitive response to modafinil tended to be those who were receiving `typical' neuroleptic medications (depots and sulpiride).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The numbers are small but there may be a rationale for this finding.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The neurotransmitter systems implicated in the promotion of wakefulness by modafinil include the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although antipsychotics share antagonism of the dopaminergic system (especially at the D2 receptor), the typicals and atypicals differ in their affinities for other receptors, particularly 5HT2A (Keefe et al, 1999).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In animal models modafinil's effect of increasing alertness is attenuated by 5HT2A antagonism (Shelton et al, 1995), hence, it is possible that atypical antipsychotic treatment (if antagonising 5HT2A) might constrain the cognotropic effects of modafinil (a hypothesis deserving further study).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Alternatively, the ability of atypicals themselves to enhance cognition (albeit to a limited extent; Keefe et al, 1999) might curtail further improvement (on modafinil).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	136	Safety There are a number of caveats to our study and its findings.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	137	 First, for the reasons described, we deliberately utilised a relatively low dose of modafinil.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This may have been sub-optimal.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Nevertheless, one of our participants underwent psychotic relapse 4 days post-drug.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We cannot determine whether modafinil was responsible.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Although covert non-adherence to concurrent medication cannot be excluded (he was receiving an oral antipsychotic), we must be wary of seeking to exculpate the test medication.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	142	 However, a psychotic reaction to a single dose of modafinil is unprecedented (to our knowledge), although there are cases of psychosis emerging de novo in those receiving multiple doses.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The British National Formulary does not mention psychosis as either a contraindication to or a consequence of modafinil exposure.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	146	In a recent study of 20 patients with schizophrenia exposed to a single dose of 200 mg of modafinil, the drug elicited no exacerbation of psychosis (Turner et al, 2004).

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Further multi-dosing studies in other centres may help to clarify the magnitude of such a putative risk.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	0	Evolving Views of the Major Histocompatibility Complex.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Pediatrics, Yale Child Health Research Center, Yale University School of Medicine; and the Department of Genetics, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	2	THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY complex (MHC) is an extended cluster of genes that are remarkable for the number and importance of the immunological functions they encode.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Historically, interest in the MHC emanated from tissue transplantation experiments, hence the reference to histocompatibility.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Now we know that this highly conserved region encodes genes that have many important and varied functions both immune and nonimmune in nature.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	5	 One family of MHC genes, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, are the most polymorphic yet discovered, with hundreds of alleles described so far.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	6	1,10 Serotyping of these polymorphisms has permitted genetic mapping with these loci in early disease-association studies.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, these polymorphisms have permitted extensive population studies revealing a number of interesting MHC associations and phenomena.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recent cDNA selections,2 genomic sequencing, and cosmid screenings have shown the existence of a large number of genes in the MHC, including a number that are expressed selectively in cells of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	9	2-8 In this review we discuss recent data that considerably expands the number of immune-related genes encoded in the MHC and review factors that may underlie its large scale organization.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	10	The MHC includes coding regions for the well-known and eponymous polymorphic surface antigens of the HLA class I and class II type that, respectively, present antigen to CD8 and CD4 T cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Intervening between the class II and the class I region of the human MHC is a class III region that includes genes for several of the components of the complement system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	12	9,10 Genes in the class II region have been found to encode components of the cytoplasmic proteasome that degrades proteins to peptides11 as well as peptide transporters for loading peptides onto class I proteins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	13	12 The class II region also encodes DM, a gene that facilitates loading and assembly of class II proteins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	14	13,14 Just centromeric to the class I region is a cluster of genes encoding three inflammation related proteins: tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), lymphotoxin (LTA), and lymphotoxin (LTB).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	15	15-18 Remarkably, the list of immune system-related genes and of chromosome segments potentially derived as duplications of parts of the MHC has grown substantially within the last year.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	16	The MHC is of major biomedical interest because of its contribution to transplant rejection and to variation between individuals in susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune disorders.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	17	19-23 In a number of cases it is clear that this susceptibility is determined by variation in the protein sequence of the class II molecules themselves.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, as will be discussed below, the possibility must still be entertained that polymorphism in other immune system-related genes of the MHC also contribute to these diseases.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	19	In addition to its role in influencing the propensity for known autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and rheumatoid arthritis (reviewed in Thomson, 199523 ), the MHC contains genes contributing to several other hereditary disorders that are either not autoimmune in nature or where the role of autoimmunity is uncertain.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These include ankylosing spondyloarthropathies, where there is a clear association with the class I allele HLA-B27, and narcolepsy, equally clearly associated with certain class II alleles.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The MHC also includes the genes for steroid 21-hydroxylase and hemochromatosis.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes the adrenogenital syndrome, and hemochromatosis is one of the most common simple Mendelian disorders of man.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recently, a major quantitative trait locus for dyslexia was mapped to the distal MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This is actively being pursued by several groups.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	25	The MHC has been extensively studied and a large number of excellent reviews exist on a range of related topics.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	26	1,10,12,19,20,26-50 The present review will largely be restricted to the newest developments in recognition of the complexity of the role of the human MHC in the immuno-hematologic systems and the relationship among segments of the MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	27	    A SUBREGION OF THE MHC CONTAINS AN UNUSUAL CONCENTRATION OF GENES RELATED TO INFLAMMATION.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	28	By convention, the MHC is divided into three contiguous regions that approximate the location of genes with shared characteristics (Fig 1).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Most centromeric on chromosome 6p is the class II region, which contains the 17 known HLA class II genes and pseudogenes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	30	5 Contiguous to that is the class III region, which encodes several of the components of the complement system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Telomeric to the class III region is the class I region, which encodes more than 18 HLA class I-related genes and pseudogenes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Recently a number of genes putatively involved in inflammation have been identified in the central MHC, at the telomeric end of the class III region.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	33	 As presented below, this group of genes may have roles in various aspects of stress, inflammation, or infection.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We suggest that this concentration of genes is sufficiently distinct to be designated as the class IV region.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	35	View larger version (16K):    Fig 1.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Expressed HLA class I and class II genes (rectangles) are positioned on the horizontal meridian.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Genes with putative immune function (triangles) and other genes (circles) are elevated above the horizontal meridian.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A blow-up view of the proposed class IV region is shown beneath.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Physical distances are approximate and derived from the sources referenced in the text, or are from unpublished data.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Symbols for known genes are conventional abbreviations or are defined in the text.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	43	5 ZNF 173 and ZNF 178 are zinc finger genes that map in the vicinity of HLA-A.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A cluster of genes for three related cytokines, TNF, LTA, and LTB, lies at the telomeric end of the class III region,42 shortly before the most centromeric class I-related genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	45	 TNF has been very extensively studied47 and plays an important role in inflammation, bacterial,51 and viral infection,52 tumor cachexia, and the immune response.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	46	 It is produced by a variety of cells including prominently monocytes, macrophages, and some T-cell subsets.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In mice, variants in the TNF gene that affect the levels of TNF production are associated with variations in the level of susceptibility to renal disease in a lupus-like syndrome.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	48	53 Polymorphisms in the human TNF gene are associated with increased susceptibility to fatal cerebral malaria,54 rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,55 and perhaps other autoimmune disorders.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	49	LTA (also called TNF-) has actions that are very similar to those of TNF on a cellular basis but its pattern of expression is considerably more limited.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Remarkably, deletion of the LTA gene leads to a specific absence of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and splenic germinal centers in mice,60,61 whereas mice lacking TNF develop lymph nodes and Peyer's patches but lack splenic primary B-cell follicles.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	51	62 Deletion of the p55 TNF receptor results in normal lymph node development and architecture, normal migration of lymphocytes into the lamina propria and epithelium of the small intestine, but no organized Peyer's patches and absence of germinal centers.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	52	63 Based on these observations it is speculated that the effect of LTA on the development of lymphoid organs may be mediated by distinct receptors, some functioning in an organ-specific context.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	53	LTB (also called TNF C) is a membrane bound molecule that forms a heterotrimer with LTA.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	54	18 This LTA-LTB complex can then induce activation of NF B in certain cell lines by binding with the LTB receptor, a member of the TNF receptor family.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	55	64,65 NF B is a pleiotropic transcription factor capable of activating the expression of a great variety of genes critical for the immunoinflammatory response.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	56	65 The LTA-LTB complex is also weakly cytotoxic to some tumor cells but does not appear to induce apoptosis.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Within 15 kb upstream of the human TNF cluster is a gene designated B144 or LST-1 (leukocyte-specific transcript),66 a homologue of a partial cDNA first identified in the mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	58	67 The transcript of this gene is expressed exclusively in monocytes, macrophages, and some T cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Expression of the gene at the RNA level is increased by various activating stimuli, and in particular by -interferon (-IFN).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The most probable gene product is encoded in an open reading frame whose cognate amino acid sequence is over 50% identical between humans and mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The amino acid sequence contains a long hydrophobic region near the N terminus but otherwise shows no apparent relationship to proteins of known function.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The interpretation of the open reading frame and the regulation of this gene is complicated by the remarkable degree of alternative splicing that is seen in the mRNA products.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	63	The B144 RNA is actually an ensemble of related sequences derived from four alternative 5' exons and 3 internal exons as well as several forms of the 3' exon.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Exons 5 and 6 may be associated with any of the 5' exons and may be separately or jointly omitted from the final mRNA product.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The result is that 24 or more forms of mRNA may be seen in U937 monocyte cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Some of these forms could encode altered forms of the putative protein while others affect only the 5' untranslated region.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The gene is also peculiar in that one spliced form apparently has a GA dinucleotide as the first bases at the 5' end of an intron.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The first two bases of introns are generally GT with an occasional GC, so that the B144 splice site is highly unusual and perhaps unique.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The mouse gene also seems to have multiple alternative splice forms in cultured cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The amount of B144 mRNA in some cells is quite substantial and it would be surprising if the protein were not formed in significant amounts, although there are presently no publications characterizing the putative protein.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	71	 A second gene, 1C7, that is preferentially expressed in monocytes and certain other hematopoietic cell lines, lies immediately adjacent to B144,68 such that the 3' ends of the two mRNA templates come within a few bases of overlapping.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The gene encodes at least three differentially spliced mRNAs.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Each mRNA encodes a potential leader sequence and an internal membrane anchor segment, but the three forms differ in the length and sequence of the carboxy-terminal intracytoplasmic domain.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The encoded product has weak similarity to surface antigens such as CTLA4.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Recently another MHC-encoded monocyte and lymphocyte-specific cDNA, called AIF-1, was identified because of its elevated level of expression in experimental cardiac transplants.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	76	69-72 Separately the gene had been characterized and termed G1.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	77	73 The gene for this transcript lies shortly centromeric of B144.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	78	 It is highly conserved between rodents and humans.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The mRNA is upregulated by -interferon and is expressed by a subset of macrophages infiltrating allografts.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The putative amino acid translation lacks a hydrophobic leader sequence.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	81	 However, it has strong homology to the EF hand protein motif found in calcium binding proteins involved in neutrophil activation74 and also in a myeloid chemoattractant protein.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	82	75 Not all cytokine genes encode leader sequences and it remains possible that the AIF-1 protein may be secreted or released from injured cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The function of this gene remains unknown.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In the same region of the MHC just telomeric to the TNF cluster is a gene for a protein that contains certain motifs similar to those seen in I B, called I B-Like (IkBL).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	85	76 The role of I B in negative regulation of NF B and hence the inflammatory response is a well-known paradigm in transcriptional control, involving regulation both by phosphorylation and by ubiquitination and protein degradation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	86	 By analogy the MHC-encoded IkBL molecule is a candidate for a regulator of inflammatory responses although it is described as being widely expressed.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Rather surprisingly, there are no functional data available for this molecule.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Centromeric of the Hsp70 genes43 lies SKI2W,77-79 a gene encoding a protein with substantial similarity to the yeast Ski2 (superkiller 2) protein,80 including its RNA helicase motifs.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Ski2 makes yeast cells resistant to killer toxin RNA viruses by virtue of its ability to block the translation of nonpolyadenylated or noncapped viral mRNAs targeted for degradation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	90	81,82 This gene plays a partially redundant but essential role in normal yeast growth83 and has an antiviral effect as well.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Because of the homologies with the yeast gene it remains possible that one role for the human gene is as a mediator of antiviral effects, particularly against RNA viruses that use nonpolyadenylated RNA during their life cycle.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The MIC (MHC class I related) family84,85 is a group of homologous genes and pseudogenes interspersed in the distal class III and class I region of the MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The structure of the genes and predicted coding products resemble that of class I genes but they are clearly a divergent family.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	94	 They are also characterized by very large first introns.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The only members of the group known to be expressed as mRNA are MIC-A and B, whose genes lie telomeric to the IkBL gene and centromeric to HLA-B.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The MIC-A protein is expressed and properly folded independently of 2-microglobulin and is preferentially expressed in the intestinal mucosa.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	97	86 Curiously, the transcription of MIC-A is upregulated by heat shock.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Thus, the gene shares properties with the class I genes per se but has at least one functional feature that would relate it to the heat shock genes located more centromerically.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	99	Overall then there are, in the central MHC between the complement region (class III) and the class I region, at least seven genes implicated to some degree in inflammatory responses.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	100	 There is also an eighth gene, 1C7, that has not yet been studied functionally but whose pattern of expression is consistent with a similar role.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In addition, the IkBL molecule near one end of this cluster is at least a potential candidate for a role in inflammation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The BAT1 gene (D6S81E ), also in this region, encodes an RNA helicase that conceivably could play a role in the complex splicing of B144 as well as other genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	103	87 At the centromeric end of this region are a number of genes of unknown function and broad expression, and also the genes for three heat shock proteins88 whose expression may be elevated in inflammation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Heat shock proteins have also been implicated in mediating antiviral effects of prostaglandins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	105	89 Overall we suggest that this segment of the MHC be given a separate designation as the class IV region with recognition of its multiple potential roles in inflammation and stress responses.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	106	    ADDITIONAL IMMUNE-RELATED GENES ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE ENTIRE MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	107	The genes mentioned in the above paragraphs and the cited reviews encode a substantial number of structurally remotely related or totally unrelated proteins that are expressed specifically within or function by interacting with cells of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Gene linkage as a consequence of duplication and divergence does not seem an adequate explanation for this clustering.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Ascertainment bias is a conceivable explanation because of the intensity with which the immune system and this gene cluster have been investigated.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This explanation seems progressively less likely as more immune-system genes of divergent structure are discovered within the cluster.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The recent finding in the distal MHC of an additional three or four genes of different families that are expressed selectively in immunocytes seems to make the coincidence argument almost untenable.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Further, these genes are of unknown function and, as of yet, of an unknown degree of polymorphism, so their potential contribution to association of MHC haplotypes with propensity for autoimmune disorders is of some interest.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The recently detected immune system genes of the distal MHC include the following.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid peptide whose sequence is remarkably conserved among eukaryotes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It is expressed in almost all cells of the body and its generic function is to become attached to other proteins and target their degradation by the proteasome system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Ubiquitin plays a role in a diverse variety of cellular processes including chromatin structure, cell-cycle control, modification of cell receptors, DNA repair processes, gene silencing, and the activation and degradation of NF B.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	117	90 However, it is curious that ubiquitin was initially studied as a peptide that might have transcellular effects in modulating the activity of immunocytes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	118	Several genes encoding ubiquitin homologues have been discovered including at least two non-MHC genes that are implicated in the function of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	119	 One of these, ISG15,91-94 encodes a protein homologous to a ubiquitin dimer that is not expressed in unstimulated cells, but is induced by - or -IFN in a variety of cell types.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	120	 After interferon treatment newly synthesized ISG15 is found intracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Pulse-chase experiments show that after 24 hours, more than 50% of labeled ISG15 is found extracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The question of whether this protein has a transcellular effect in vivo remains unaddressed.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	123	The primary product of the ISG15 gene contains an extension of eight amino acids beyond the C terminal diglycine that is characteristic of ubiquitin.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	124	96 This C terminal extension is rapidly removed intracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The primary translation product has no demonstrated effect on cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In contrast the processed product is active at the low nanogram per milliliter level in inducing -IFN production by T cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	127	97 This peptide also induces a remarkable proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells in B-cell-depleted mononuclear cell populations.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	128	98 The effect on NK cells requires the presence of T cells but cannot be accounted for by -IFN interferon itself.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	129	Nakamura et al99 have been investigating a ubiquitin homologue synthesized by T cells, and that acts as a nonantigen-specific suppresser factor of B cells.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	172	An alternative proposal for the cause of the clustering of these diverse genes of the immune system is that particular allelic forms at one locus create proteins that interact preferentially with the products of one or another allelic form at a second locus.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	181	 For example, it is not inconceivable that a class II allele associated with early onset of a severe autoimmune disease might become associated with alleles of linked genes that themselves have a protective effect against that particular autoimmune disorder.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	193	124 The occurrence of olfactory receptors within the MHC may favor the selection of certain receptor alleles matched to a subset of MHC-determined odorants, such that those haplotypes that carry certain matched alleles would have a selective advantage in the population.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	194	If odorant discrimination is learned, this could have implications for the population genetics of the MHC in species where odorant attraction or repulsion is important.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In addition, the resulting rapid shifts in allele abundance and composition of the class I and class II genes, whether due to parasite-driven selection or to effects of the MHC on procreation, may result in the emergence of autoimmune phenomena putting secondary selective pressure on other genes of the immune system to diminish the incidence or consequences of autoimmunity.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Also, the extreme divergence of class I regions of mammals compared with even the class II region raises the question of whether there are other evolutionary pressures on class I genes beyond those arising from the presentation of peptides to the T-cell receptor.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	348	The presence of other immune system genes in the same chromosomal region and therefore in linkage disequilibrium with the classical MHC genes provides the opportunity for simultaneous selection of the optimal alleles of these other genes from among the variety of chromosomes carrying the newly selected class I or II allele.

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	5	Recent physiological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that orexin A may play an important role in control of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	6	 For example, it has been shown that central administration of orexin A stimulates LH secretion (11).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, similar to other orexigenic peptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin has been shown to have bimodal effects on LH secretion, with orexin stimulating LH secretion in steroid-primed ovariectomized rats but inhibiting LH secretion in the absence of ovarian steroids (11, 12).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It has also been demonstrated that immunoneutralization of orexin A in the brain completely abolishes both LH and PRL surges, but icv administration of orexin leads to a dose-dependent recovery of fasting-suppressed LH surges (13).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition, tissue explant studies have shown that orexin A stimulates GnRH release from the hypothalamus of both intact male rats and female rats at proestrus (14).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Recently a study employing low-dose estrogen replacement in ovariectomized rats, resulting in serum levels similar to those observed in diestrus, demonstrated that low-dose estrogen potentiates the suppressive effects of centrally administered orexin A on LH secretion (15), suggesting that orexin A is inhibitory during diestrus, or low estrogen states, and excitatory during surge conditions.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Although orexin is clearly implicated in the regulation of GnRH/LH secretion, the neuroanatomical pathway by which orexin may be mediating its effects in the rat remains to be determined.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether orexin fibers project to and come in close contact with GnRH neurons and whether GnRH neurons express OX-R1 in the rat.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	13	Similar to orexin, NPY has been found to elicit bimodal effects on LH release, most likely acting through the Y1 (16, 17, 18), Y4 (17, 19, 20, 21), or Y5 (22, 23) receptor subtypes.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Recently our laboratory reported that the majority of orexin cell bodies in the LHA expressed Y4-like immunoreactivity (Y4-ir), and some orexin fibers also were positive for Y4-ir (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Others have shown that activation of Y4 receptors with a Y4 agonist, 1229U91, or a high-affinity ligand for the Y4 receptor, rat pancreatic polypeptide (rPP), stimulates GnRH neurons and in turn LH release in intact male rats (20) and is important in the basal release of LH in the female rat (17).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Conversely, when the infertile, leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is crossed with the Y4 knockout mouse, fertility is partially restored, suggesting the Y4 receptor is involved in suppressing reproductive function (21).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Taken together, these data suggest that some of the effects of Y4 activation on LH release may be mediated via orexin.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Therefore, the second aim of the present study was to characterize the neuroanatomical relationship between Y4-positive orexin fibers and GnRH neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	19	For immunocytochemical studies, animals (n = 4 to 5, both male and female rats were used in each experiment) were killed under pentobarbital anesthesia by cardiac infusion with ice-cold PBS followed by ice-cold paraformaldehyde in NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Also, leptin has been shown to play a role in regulating reproductive function.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Administration of leptin restores fasting-induced suppression of LH secretion in both sheep and primates (31, 32, 33).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, GnRH neurons do not express Ob-Rb.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	132	 As previously suggested by similar findings in the ovine hypothalamus (25), direct projections by Ob-Rb-expressing orexin neurons to GnRH neurons may provide one potential neuroanatomical circuit by which leptin regulates GnRH activity.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	133	NPY is another neuropeptide system that may be an important integrating signal for both energy balance/food intake and reproductive function (34).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Similar to the effects of orexin, NPY also elicits steroid-dependent effects on LH secretion (35).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Orexin neurons in the LHA receive direct synaptic contacts by NPY neurons projecting from the arcuate nucleus and in turn send reciprocal projections to arcuate nucleus NPY neurons (36).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Currently, there is evidence implicating the Y1 (16, 17, 18), Y4 (17, 19, 20, 21), and Y5 (22, 23) receptor subtypes in NPY s modulation of neuroendocrine reproductive function.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Of direct relevance, Y4-ir and mRNA are colocalized with orexin neurons in the LHA (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	138	 These data, coupled with the present findings that GnRH neurons express the OX-R1 and are contacted by orexin fibers, demonstrate a unique potential neuronal circuit whereby NPY, acting through the Y4 receptor, can exert its effects on LH release via the modulation of orexin.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Because the present study also showed that Y4-positive orexin fibers were never observed in close contact with GnRH neurons, the major actions of the Y4 receptor appear to be through postsynaptic effects on orexin cell bodies within the LHA.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Taken together, these data suggest that orexin neurons, by receiving critical input via Y4 and leptin receptors, may provide an important link between the regulation of energy balance and reproductive function.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	141	A number of questions remain concerning the modulatory effects of the Y4-orexin system on GnRH neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	142	 First, the endogenous ligand for the brain Y4 receptor is not clear.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Is it NPY, which has a much lower affinity for the Y4 receptor (37), or other pancreatic polypeptide family ligands? Our recent study characterizing the expression of Y4-ir on orexin neurons also found that administration of rPP, an endogenous ligand of the Y4 receptor, induced robust cFos activation in orexin neurons (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Furthermore, rPP stimulated a modest increase in food intake and a robust drinking response (19), which is similar to responses by orexin.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	145	 These data suggest that stimulation of the Y4 receptor by rPP is excitatory to orexin neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, the effects of Y4 on reproductive function have been shown to be both stimulatory (17, 20) and inhibitory (21).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Similarly, the effects of orexin have been reported to be both stimulatory and inhibitory to reproductive function (11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Therefore, it is possible the actions of the Y4 receptor on the GnRH/LH axis are mediated via the orexin system.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	149	In summary, these data provide neuroanatomical evidence for a direct link between the orexin system and GnRH neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	150	 These findings suggest that orexin plays a direct role in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction and may also be uniquely positioned to integrate signals associated with energy balance regulation.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Additional studies will be necessary to establish the relative importance of this novel neuronal circuitry in the regulation of reproductive function during normal cyclicity as well as during metabolic changes.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Initial work reported that continuous picomole infusions of CCK into the cerebral ventricles of sheep suppressed feeding (12), but results in rodent models have been mixed.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although some studies have identified feeding inhibitory actions of central ventricular CCK administration, issues of dosage and access to peripheral sites have been raised (13, 14).

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These rats have no feeding response to peripherally exogenous CCK administration (20).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Consistent with the lack of an intact peripheral CCK satiety signaling, food intake in OLETF rats is characterized by significant and chronic increases in meal sizes.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In response to this increase, meal number is decreased, but the decrease is not compensatory, and as a result, OLETF rats are hyperphagic (20).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although the increase in meal size in OLETF rats is consistent with the absence of peripheral CCK signaling, the overall hyperphagia and obesity were surprising.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Pair-feeding OLETF rats to the intake of Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats completely prevents their obesity, demonstrating that the increased body weight is secondary to the hyperphagia and does not depend on metabolic alterations.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Pair-feeding not only prevented the increased body weight, but also normalized the elevated levels of leptin and insulin and the alterations in arcuate nucleus neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in OLETF rats (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Pair-feeding also revealed what seems to be a primary deficit in dorsomedial hypothalamic (DMH) NPY mRNA expression in OLETF rats.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	19	 DMH NPY mRNA expression was significantly elevated in pair-fed, normal weight OLETF rats, and this elevation was also found in 5-wk-old preobese OLETF rats (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We have suggested that this dysregulation of DMH NPY gene expression may, in combination with the peripheral satiety deficit, contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats (21).

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These data suggest that CCK acting through CCK-AR plays a differential role in circadian activities between rats and mice.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Although this may reflect a differential ability to compensate for smaller rather than larger increases in meal size, the present data also suggest that this difference in phenotype may be the outcome of a different distribution of brain CCK-AR between rats and mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The potential importance of this differential distribution derives from the findings that in intact rats, NPY and CCK-AR are colocalized in DMH neurons, and CCK plays a role in modulating DMH NPY; exogenous administration of CCK into the DMH down-regulates DMH NPY mRNA expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results are consistent our previous findings demonstrating that NPY gene expression is up-regulated in the DMH in OLETF rats that lack CCK-AR (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Although pair-feeding OLETF rats prevented their increased body weight and normalized their altered arcuate NPY and POMC gene expression, pair-feeding resulted in significantly elevated NPY gene expression in the DMH.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This elevation of NPY mRNA expression in the DMH was also documented in young preobese OLETF rats (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Therefore, CCK acting through CCK-ARs in the DMH appears to suppress DMH NPY gene expression in the rat.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Such a suppression inhibits energy intake, in that DMH CCK injection reduces food intake.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In contrast, DMH NPY-containing neurons do not express leptin receptors, and DMH NPY mRNA expression does not increase in response to acute food deprivation (25).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Moreover, within the DMH, the region of altered NPY expression in response to a variety of treatments appears to differ.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The current data demonstrating that the reduction of DMH NPY expression by CCK is localized to the compact subregion are consistent with our previous findings (21, 25).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Whereas in lactating rats, Smith (36) had reported that although there was a very slight increase in NPY mRNA expression in the compact area, DMH NPY mRNA expression was mainly induced in the diffuse portion of the DMH.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Evidence that there are NPY-expressing neurons in the mouse comes from data demonstrating the induction of DMH NPY expression in several obesity models of disrupted melanocortin signaling: lethal agouti yellow (Ay), melanocortin 4 receptor knockout (MC4R to / to ) mice (38), and diet-induced obese mice (39).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Such data suggest interactions between melanocortin signaling and metabolic status in the control of DMH NPY functions in the mouse.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	207	 These projections may be the basis for the arcuate NPY reduction in response to DMH CCK injection.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	208	A role for the DMH in feeding control has long been suggested.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Bellinger and colleagues (41) demonstrated that small DMH electrolytic or excitotoxic lesions (DMHL) result in hypophagia, hypodipsia, reduced body weight, and reduced linear growth in the rat.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Despite findings such as these, the particular contribution of the DMH and how it interacts with other hypothalamic nuclei involved in energy balance has not been well understood.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Our findings in the rat suggest that the basis of the DMHL-induced hypophagia may be the elimination of an NPY-ergic output, an output normally under the control of CCK acting through CCK-AR.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Although the distribution and mediation of CCK-AR in human brain are unclear, data from other primates have demonstrated that the DMH contains CCK-AR binding site in the monkey (43), and central injection of the CCK-AR, but not the B receptor, agonist inhibits food intake in the baboon (44).

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	217	 OLETF rats are not a targeted deletion of CCK-AR, but arose a spontaneous mutation.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	218	 It is quite possible that there are other genetic alterations in the OLETF rat that alone or in combination with the alterations in CCK-AR signaling account for the hyperphagia, obesity, or diabetes (49).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, such additional genetic defects are yet to be identified.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	220	In summary, the present results suggest that although both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR demonstrate a deficit in meal size control, the differential distribution of CCK-AR in rat and mouse brains may determine the divergent effects of CCK-AR gene disruption.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In the rat brain, CCK acting through CCK-AR appears to play a role in regulating DMH NPY gene expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	222	 DMH CCK inhibits NPY mRNA expression and food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In the absence of CCK-AR, OLETF rats have a deficit in the control of DMH NPY gene expression, resulting in increased DMH NPY gene expression, increased food intake, and, eventually, obesity.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In contrast, we found no evidence for the presence of CCK-AR in the DMH of the mouse.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Thus, CCK-AR does not contribute to the control of DMH NPY gene expression, and in the absence of this central deficit, mice lacking CCK-AR are able to compensate for the absence of CCK satiety signaling and do not become hyperphagic and obese.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	3	To search for obesity candidate genes, we used a combined bioinformatic and molecular biology approach to identify novel genes important to the function of the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The hypothalamus is a complex region of the brain involved in homeostatic processes including, but not limited to, energy balance.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We identified a set of genes already known to be important to hypothalamic function and a set of genes not previously associated with the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We propose that these genes may be important in the function of the hypothalamus, may provide a new source of hypothalamus-specific regulatory elements, and may be important in disorders of hypothalamic function, such as obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, genes identified in this search are now candidate genes for obesity-related traits genetically mapped to the chromosomal intervals in which they reside.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	8	 RNA in situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes on 20- microm cryosections of embryonic day 18.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Probes for Hcrt, A26100, Dscr1l2, Impact, and Pnck were derived from PCR fragments amplified from reverse-transcribed adult mouse hypothalamus mRNA with recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned into a pBluescript vector (Invitrogen).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The Hcrt probe includes positions 7 to 573 of hypocretin (Hcrt) mRNA (NM_010410).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The A26100 probe includes positions 432 to 1,004 of RIKEN cDNA 2610042L04 gene (2610042L04Rik) mRNA (NM_025940).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The Dscr1l2 probe includes positions 177 to 638 of Down syndrome critical region gene 1-like 2 (Dscr1l2) mRNA (NM_022980).

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	17	 All studies involving animals were performed according to the guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals at the University of Alberta.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	18	Strategy for identification of hypothalamic transcripts.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We reasoned that genes important in hypothalamic development or function are likely to be transcribed in hypothalamic precursor tissues or the mature hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The laboratory mouse is a model particularly amenable to studies of brain function because of similarities in anatomy to the human hypothalamus and because of its widespread use in obesity studies.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We performed three searches using different criteria to query the GNF expression database for genes highly expressed in the postnatal murine hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Our first search of the GNF database used low-specificity criteria that required only high expression in the hypothalamus, of at least 8 times the median of the expression level in all 45 mouse tissues.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This search identified a set of genes already studied for their role in hypothalamic function, such as pro-opiomelanocortin- (POMC) and Hcrt, but also identified many genes broadly expressed in the nervous system, such as the microtubule-associated protein-.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Notably, some genes important in obesity and/or hypothalamic function were not identified under these conditions (e.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Our second search of the GNF database used high-specificity criteria as that for the first search, high expression in the hypothalamus of at least eight times the median of the expression in other tissues.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, the second search required low expression ( < 3 times the median) in at least 40 other tissues.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This second search identified five genes including arginine vasopressin, POMC, Hcrt, and oxytocin, all of which have major roles in endocrine regulation in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Significantly, this high-specificity search also identified Magel2, which is developmentally regulated and inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We then formulated a third search with intermediate specificity: expression in the hypothalamus over eight times the median level of all tissues and fewer than five tissues with over three times the median level of expression.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The third search of the GNF database identified a set of 15 genes highly expressed in the hypothalamus but moderately to highly expressed in only 5 other murine tissues (Table 1, screen 1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We repeated the third search using an updated database, the 2004 version of the mouse Geneatlas.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	32	 As with the third search of the GNF database, the search of Geneatlas 2004 identified genes with high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression elsewhere in the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We then used the correlation function of the searchable Symatlas database within Geneatlas.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The Symatlas search was refined to allow either high or low expression in the preoptic region, which functionally overlaps with the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This last search, still using intermediate specificity criteria, identified 7 genes, 3 of which were identified in the GNF intermediate-specificity search (Table 1, screen 2), for a total of 19 genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Intermediate search of the GNF Gene Expression Atlas to detect genes highly expressed in the hypothalamus and expressed at low levels in most other tissues.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	37	  Selection of novel hypothalamic genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Of the 19 genes from the two searches of the GNF databases, 3 genes were identified in both searches (Table 1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Because the nature of the search engine provided by GNF changed from the 2002 release to the 2004 release, the two search criteria were not directly comparable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In common between the two searches was the requirement for high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression in other regions of the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Because we were interested in identifying genes not known to be important in the hypothalamus, we first set aside genes whose role in hypothalamic function has been well described.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These included genes encoding the neuropeptide signaling molecules Hcrt/orexin, pro-opiomelanocortin-, oxytocin, agouti-related protein, and arginine vasopressin (4).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A neuroendocrine role for calcitonin and the calcitonin receptor in growth hormone secretion in the hypothalamus/pituitary had previously been suggested (17).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We had previously identified Magel2 as specifically expressed in the developing murine hypothalamus, although its function in this tissue is not yet known (16).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Magel2 is of particular interest because its human ortholog, MAGEL2, is one of a set of genes inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (9, 15).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Finally, mutations in Patched (Ptch1) can result in holoprosencephaly and developmental delay in humans or, alternatively, cause basal cell nervous syndrome when homozygously inactivated in somatic cells.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Ptch1 is an antagonist of the signaling molecule hedgehog, which functions in patterning of the neural tube but is not known to have a specific role in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The remaining 11 genes fell into 2 categories: 1) novel genes for which a function has been predicted by sequence similarity to known genes and 2) novel genes with no known function and no or limited similarity to known genes (Table 2).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We examined the UniGene clusters associated with these novel genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Because EST sets made from hypothalamus RNA are represented in mouse EST databases, we expected to see a representation of hypothalamic cDNAs within the Unigene clusters corresponding to these genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Indeed, all 11 genes had corresponding ESTs derived from the whole brain, with some specifically including the hypothalamus (4) or diencephalon (2) (Table 2).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The information in the UniGene clusters did not point to these genes being particularly hypothalamus specific, in contrast to the Unigene cluster for arginine vasopressin, for example, in which 12 of the 19 ESTs were derived from the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	53	 We then used the EST ProfileViewer function in Unigene to test whether the expression profile derived from ESTs overlapped with that derived from the Geneatlas databases.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Seven of the eleven novel genes had a major contribution of ESTs from the brain or pituitary gland; the hypothalamus was included as a "brain" sample in the EST Profile viewer.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In one case (Itih3), the majority of UniGene ESTs were derived from the liver, with a small minority from the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This is consistent with the Geneatlas distribution, which shows the highest expression of Itih3 in the liver, with most of the remaining expression in preoptic and hypothalamus samples.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In one other case (Dscr1l2), the UniGene ESTs did not distribute into any tissue-specific pattern, although an examination of the developmental timing of expression, also using the function in Unigene, demonstrated that the vast majority of ESTs were derived from the egg as opposed to preimplantation embryos or any postimplantation embryonic stage.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This is in contrast to the GeneAtlas 2004 expression profile, which shows very little tissue specificity for the Dscr1l2 transcript, and also contrasts with the GeneAtlas 2002 expression profile, which showed more specific expression in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Similarly, the Pitpnm1 showed conflicting expression profiles between the GeneAtlas 2002, GeneAtlas 2004, and EST ProfileViewer, with the one commonality being expression in the eye.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	60	 EST expression profile and murine gene targeting studies.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	61	 We first verified that the 11 selected genes were indeed expressed in the murine hypothalamus by RT-PCR on RNA samples from the adult mouse hypothalamus (data not shown).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	62	 We then localized the expression to specific hypothalamic nuclei by RNA in situ hybridization using a standard mouse atlas to label the sections (13).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	63	 A probe for Hcrt displayed a strong signal in the lateral anterior hypothalamus, consistent with the known abundance of RNA transcripts in this region of the brain (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Consistent with the earlier embryonic expression of Magel2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (16), we detected Magel2 transcripts in the anterior hypothalamus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	65	 We then selected four genes that emerged from the bioinformatic analysis but about which little else was known.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	66	 All four genes displayed high levels of expression in the hypothalamus compared with surrounding brain tissue by RNA in situ hybridization (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Probes for A2610042L04 and Pnck detected abundant expression in the anterior hypothalamus, whereas a probe for Dscr1l2 detected the strongest expressions in the dorsal medial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus, and a probe for Impact detected the highest expression in the arcuate nucleus.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	74	 All sections are oriented with the ventral aspect at the bottom.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	75	 We used NCBI databases to map the 11 selected genes to chromosomal regions in the mouse genome (NCBI build 33) and human genome (NCBI build 35) (Table 3).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	76	 We then correlated the map positions of selected genes with the genomic positions of published loci influencing obesity-related traits in either human or other mammals (23) (Table 3) updated and published on-line as "The Obesity Gene Map Database" (11a).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We identified eight traits, such as body mass index, fat mass, and percent body fat, that had been mapped to the same chromosomal regions as our selected genes in human studies of weight gain and obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	78	 We then identified cases where obesity traits had been identified as mapping within the mouse, rat, or pig chromosomal region homologous to human chromosome band(s) containing the selected genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	79	 We did not include traits that had been mapped to an interval that contained more than three chromosome bands, which would contain a very large number of candidate genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In this way, we identified 13 obesity-related traits in the mouse (11), rat (1), or pig (1) that correlated to the map positions of 6 of the 11 selected genes; these traits were all related to obesity and weight gain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Except for A2610042L04, a poorly characterized predicted mouse gene on chromosome 14, all selected genes were in regions of a mammalian genome where genetic evidence for an obesity-related trait exists.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Obesity traits near candidate genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	83	We identified 11 genes whose expression is enriched in the hypothalamus but which were not previously associated with the development of the hypothalamus or its function.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The candidate genes could be involved in any number of the interrelated processes partially mediated by the hypothalamus besides energy and fluid balance, such as circadian rhythm, reproduction, stress responses, and temperature regulation (1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The definitive proof of their involvement in obesity, rather than in other functions of the hypothalamus, would come from a demonstration of gene dysregulation in various models of obesity, including genetic and diet-induced obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	86	 We concentrated on obesity because of the large number of studies providing genetically mapped obesity-related traits, but the genes that we identified could equally well have roles in other disorders of hypothalamic function.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Other regions of the brain, including the cortex and hindbrain, have important roles in food intake (22) but have major roles in other neurological functions.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The gut, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues also have major roles in appetite, and parallel studies could reveal novel obesity susceptibility genes that are highly and specifically expressed in those tissues but not expressed in the brain and hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	89	Because susceptibility to obesity is in part genetically determined, variations in these genes may contribute to familial obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The information available about the cellular and physiological function of the proteins encoded by these genes is, however, highly variable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Furthermore, the size of the intervals in which obesity traits have been mapped is also highly variable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Further genetic and molecular studies would clarify possible roles of the candidate genes in obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	93	 For example, the candidate gene located within the region where specific mouse strains or human subjects have shown genetic predisposition to obesity could be sequenced for coding or regulatory sequence variants.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	94	 These variants could then be tested in larger populations for association with obesity-related traits, including traits genetically mapped to the chromosomal intervals in which the genes reside.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Finally, further investigations of the physiological and cellular functions of the proteins identified in this and other bioinformatic screens may elucidate the role of specific genes and gene products in hypothalamic function and genetic predisposition to obesity.

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	5	In addition to their important metabolic effects in the periphery, glucocorticoids act in several hypothalamic nuclei associated with the control of energy balance.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Several studies have elucidated the actions of glucocorticoids on activity of both the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei (ARC) (8).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Less explored is whether glucocorticoids also act upon neuropeptide systems within the lateral hypothalamus (LH).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Because it has long been known that activity of the LH is associated with increased food intake and weight gain, one reasonable hypothesis about the powerful effects of glucocorticoids to stimulate positive energy balance is that they act in part by stimulating the neuropeptide systems within the LH.

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Neuroanatomical studies in rats demonstrate that MCH gene expression is limited to the LH and the zona incerta with extensive fiber projections throughout the brain (10).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	11	 MCH is produced from prepro-MCH along with two other putative peptides, neuropeptides EI and GE (11).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The only known MCH receptor in rats is SLC-1, a G-coupled protein receptor present throughout the brain and periphery (12, 13).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Central MCH is involved in many different physiological functions including reproduction, stress, activity, and importantly energy balance (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Food restriction increases MCH expression, and central injection of MCH promotes feeding (15).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition, MCH-deficient mice have reduced body weight and are lean due to hypophagia and an increase in metabolic rate (16).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The central administration of MCH also elicits an increase of water intake that is independent of food intake (17).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	17	The second peptide system contained in the LH is the orexins (also known as hypocretins), which originate from prepro-orexin (prepro-hypocretin) (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Orexin influences a variety of endocrine, autonomic, and metabolic functions, including the control of food intake, wakefulness, motor activity, metabolic rate, and blood pressure (19).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Orexin A is a 33-amino acid peptide that increases food intake and body weight in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the brain (20).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Conversely, administration of an orexin receptor antibody reduces food intake in fasted rats (21).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Similar to MCH, fasting up-regulates orexin mRNA expression (22).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Orexin-containing neurons project widely through the central nervous system and to hypothalamic nuclei important for the control of feeding where orexin receptors are located such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN), LH, ARC, and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	23	Given the profound effects of glucocorticoids on feeding and orexigenic hypothalamic peptides, the goal of the present study was to assess the potential role of glucocorticoids to influence the effects of MCH and orexin A on food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids promote the actions of the peptides in the lateral hypothalamus as part of the complex hypothalamic system that regulates energy balance.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	25	 As a result, the present study first investigated the effects of third ventricular (i3vt) administration of MCH and orexin A on food intake in both ADX rats and sham-operated controls.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Next, we examined the influence of glucocorticoids on the expression of both MCH and orexin mRNA using semiquantitative PCR.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Because ADX causes a deficiency of circulating hormones in addition to glucocorticoids, we also examined whether or not glucocorticoid replacement could reverse any of the effects observed after ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, we assessed the potential colocalization of MCH and orexin protein with glucocorticoid receptors within the LH to determine whether glucocorticoids may act directly on these neuronal populations.

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	165	In addition to examining the effect of glucocorticoids on the hyperphagic actions of MCH and orexin A, we examined the actions of glucocorticoids to alter mRNA expression of MCH and orexin.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In accord with previous data, ADX reduced hypothalamic MCH mRNA, and orexin mRNA (28, 29).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, these reductions observed in both MCH and orexin were not restored by 5 d of corticosterone replacement in the drinking water despite this regimen achieving glucocorticoid levels comparable to those of sham-operated animals.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	168	 These data suggest that the gene expression changes in these lateral hypothalamic peptides are not glucocorticoid dependent but depend on nonglucocorticoid aspects of ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Previous reports described that MCH mRNA was increased above that of sham controls in ADX rats treated with dexamethasone (28).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Similarly, dexamethasone administration restored orexin mRNA after ADX (29).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Although it is commonly used, dexamethasone does not have the same binding properties as glucocorticoids (30), and it makes it much harder to assess whether physiological levels of glucocorticoid replacement are achieved.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Further work is necessary to address whether these methodological differences underlie the differences between the current data and reports from other groups.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that mineralocorticoids may have significant effects on the lateral hypothalamus.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This is particularly true in the case of MCH because we have reported that MCH has a potent and rapid effect to increase water intake even in the absence of available food (17), making it possible that the osmoregulatory aspects of mineralocorticoids may influence fluid ingestion via actions on MCH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	175	Glucocorticoid receptors are present in regions of the hypothalamus important for the regulation of food intake and body weight, including the ARC, PVN, and LH (27), suggesting that glucocorticoids may directly influence the activity or responsiveness of numerous neuropeptide systems regulating feeding.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Despite the fact that there is a large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LH, there is no evidence that any of them are located on either MCH- or orexin-containing neurons.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This is consistent with the data from the gene expression experiments, in which changes in both MCH and orexin expression appeared not to be tied to glucocorticoid action.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	178	Collectively, these data make several interesting points.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	179	 First, these data provide another dissociation between the MCH and orexin systems in the LH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Although both systems have cell bodies almost exclusively in the LH and act to regulate food intake, they appear to do so by separate neural circuits.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	181	 These data indicate that the actions of MCH to stimulate food intake are glucocorticoid dependent, whereas the actions of orexin-A are not.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In addition, MCH should now be added to the extensive list of regulatory peptides whose effects are altered by glucocorticoids.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thus it appears that glucocorticoids have broad effects on a number of central nervous system circuits that have been linked to the control of food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	184	The present data also allow for some speculation about how glucocorticoids influence the actions of MCH to increase food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	185	 MCH has projections to many brain regions important in the regulation of energy balance (10).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	186	 For example, SLC-1 (the first and only identified MCH receptor in rodents) mRNA and immunoreactivity have been observed in the ARC, PVN, LH, and VMN (13).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It is possible, then, that glucocorticoids exert their effects on the MCH-food intake system by acting on the target cells for MCH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	188	 For example, strong signals for both SLC-1 and GR have been observed in the PVN, making this a potential candidate for the site of action of glucocorticoids to reduce MCH s ability to increase food intake (13, 27).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	189	There are data indicating that the melanocortin system antagonizes the MCH system.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Consistent with this, MCH and -MSH exert opposing and antagonistic effects on food intake (31).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Other studies demonstrate that administration of either agouti-related protein (AgRP) or SHU9119 increases MCH mRNA but not orexin mRNA (32).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Because ADX increases melanocortin tone in some rodent models (33, 34), it is possible to speculate that this increase in melanocortin tone may antagonize the orexigenic effects of MCH, leading to the present effects of ADX on MCH, but not on orexin.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	193	Another possibility is that MCH exerts its effects via actions in the ARC to alter the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and/or AgRP.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Glucocorticoid receptors are found on these neurons (35) and the potent orexigenic effects of NPY and AgRP are blocked by glucocorticoid deficiency (34, 36).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Recent reports indicate that the ARC is a potent site for MCH to increase food intake and that in hypothalamic explants, the administration of MCH increases the release of NPY, suggesting that MCH may act through the activation of NPY neurons to affect feeding (37).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These data lead to the hypothesis that reduced action of MCH during glucocorticoid deficiency could be due to decreased actions of NPY and/or AgRP.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The reverse may also be true; that is, it has been proposed that NPY and/or AgRP exert their effects via recruiting MCH neurons in the LH (38).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Double-label immunohistochemistry demonstrates that MCH neurons receive innervation from NPY-immunoreactive fibers (39), and data also suggest that MCH neurons may express NPY receptors (40).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Such evidence encourages the hypothesis that the effect of ADX to reduce the orexigenic actions of MCH may be responsible for the alteration of NPY actions after ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Future research should identify the glucocorticoid receptor populations that are responsible for the ability of glucocorticoids to dramatically alter the effects of a variety of neuropeptides such as MCH, NPY, -MSH, and AgRP.

0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	206	Analysis of the heterozygous retinas provides insights into the role of the mutant alleles in retinal development and maintenance.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Through random X-inactivation (23), approximately 50% of the retinal cells express the mutant or normal RPGR, and the expression of the mutant gene can be examined in the milieu where half of the photoreceptors are genetically normal.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Carriers of either disease show ophthalmoscopically visible patchy retinal degeneration  to  an indication of mosaicism, the hallmark of retinal random X-inactivation (24).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These changes, which are variable in extent and severity, are evident in most carriers by the time they are young adults, and in all by the time they are advanced in age.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These abnormalities are stationary in XLPRA1, but some XLPRA2 carriers often show progressive disease that results in advanced retinal degeneration by 5 to 6 years of age or older.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In contrast, lack of any disease in aged heterozygous red wolves suggests that the three-nucleotide deletion is a benign polymorphism.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	212	The severe retinal disease phenotype in canine XLPRA is comparable to what has been reported for human patients with RPGR mutations, given the caveat that, at least in humans, only a limited number of phenotype to genotype correlation studies have been reported.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	213	 With the exception of two reports that, retrospectively, represent mutations in exon ORF15 (25,26), all others have been limited primarily to exons 1 to 10 (e.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	214	 These studies show comparably severe clinical phenotypes in XLRP patients to those found in the two canine models.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Also, the majority of carriers show clinical disease varying from mild to severe [impaired night vision or visual field loss (3,24)].
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In some families, the disease was sufficiently severe in females to be considered semidominant (28).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Examination of exon ORF15 in these has identified null alleles in four of nine families (J.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Rozet, personal communication, 26 July 2001).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	219	Expression studies of RPGR have shown that alternative splicing is complex, and species-specific variants may exist.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The splice variants reported for RPGR are mainly after exon 13, especially in the brain and testes (18,25).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Additionally, alternative exon usage of introns has been found frequently for RPGR transcripts; for example exon 14a (intron 14) in mouse (25) and dog (18), exons 15a, 15b1, 15b2 and ORF15 (intron 15) in human, mouse, cow and dog (8 and present study), and exon 19a in mouse [intron 18 (25)].
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The alternative splicing and exon usage suggests that different RPGR protein isoforms are produced for specific functions in vivo.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The exon 16 to 19 probe mainly detected an 8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	224	9 kb band, but failed to detect the 5 kb band that was recognized with probes for exons 3 to 10, exon 14a and ORF15.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This result suggests that exon ORF15 can be used as a terminal exon (5 kb band), or alternatively spliced to exons 16 to 19 (8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We have found a putative consensus splice donor site, conserved between human and dog, located before the stop codon in the 3' coding region of exon ORF15.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This may splice exon ORF15 to exons 16 to 19, and translate the polypeptide in frame to include most of exon ORF15 and exons 16 to 19.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In this case, the putative protein will regain the C-terminal isoprenylation site ( to CTIL) located in alternative terminal exon 19 (2).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	229	Higher-molecular-weight mRNA bands have been reported previously, including 3.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	230	5 and 20 kb in eye and brain (25 and present study).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Recently, a 6 kb band has been reported for human retina with both ORF15 and exon 3 to 19 probes (29).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	232	9 kb band has no match to known sizes of RPGR sequences.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This suggests that additional undiscovered exon(s) or alternative polyadenylation sites are used in RPGR processing.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	234	 In addition, with the exon ORF15 probe, we consistently detected two bands with similar intensity, 8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	235	9 kb and another of slightly smaller size (Fig.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	236	 6A), which suggests that different splice variants may exist.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The spatial relevance of the predominant 5 kb splice variant expressed in retina, and the mutations found in exon ORF15, may explain why the observed phenotype is confined to the retina.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	238	The transfection data emphasize the differences in expression profiles between the two mutant exon ORF15 proteins.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In vitro, the XLPRA1 premature stop mutant behaves similarly to the wild-type protein, whereas the XLPRA2 frameshift protein aggregates in the ER compartment.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In examining the transfection results, we attach no significance to the presence or absence of GFP nuclear labeling, since it may result from protein cleavage in a small proportion of constructs so that GFP enters the nucleus, or a weak nuclear localization in the vector.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Aggregation of XLPRA2 mutant exon ORF15 protein may result from the additional abnormal residues, which impair proper folding.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The in vitro results are consistent with the phenotypic differences found in the two diseases.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Based on the presence of retinal transcripts with exon ORF15 in both normal and XLPRA mutant retinas, and the very different phenotypes of the two diseases, we propose that the XLPRA1 mutation causes a loss of function that is not critical for visual cells during development, but is essential later for their sustained viability.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In contrast, the XLPRA2 mutation affects photoreceptors early in development, and has devastating consequences for the retina.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	245	The results of our studies highlight the importance of RPGR exon ORF15 in photoreceptor function and viability.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	246	 They indicate that very different retinal phenotypes can result from mutations in this novel exon, a situation that is similar in human RP3 families.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Finally, we show the value of the canine model, and the tools available for comparative genomic analysis, to aid in understanding gene function and diseases that are of importance to humans and other species.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Some of the clinical states associated with abnormal sleep include pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular disease, thrombotic disease, epilepsy, arthritis, mood disorders, chronic pain, and shortened life span (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The physical consequences of sleep deprivation have not been localized.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Evidence from studies in laboratory animals suggest that multitropic factors in immune and hormonal systems contribute to the absence of localization.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	8	The three principal consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation in the rat are a progressively deepening negative energy balance (8, 18, 23), reduced thyroid hormone concentrations (8, 19, 20), and abnormal control of microorganisms (22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Sleep-deprived rats become strikingly and progressively hyperphagic but do not gain weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The negative energy balance is not due to malabsorption of calories (8) or diabetes (18) but may be a metabolic response to infectious processes.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Abnormal control of microorganisms was discovered by the detection of live, pathogenic bacteria in normally sterile body tissues (16, 22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This deficiency in the host defense system is the earliest clinically and biologically significant sign so far discovered, occurring within five experimental days when the outward appearance of the animal is healthy and metabolic changes are not as marked as they later become.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The third principal feature, hypothyroxinemia, is manifested by a progressive decline in both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), with T4 eventually reaching levels below assay detection in some cases (20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	14	 After an average of 3 wk, these and other signs result in advanced morbidity (scrawny and feeble appearance, decreased food intake from peak consumption) and hypothermia (8, 18), primary bacteremia with poor or absent inflammatory responses (16), and subsequent lethality (53).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	15	Recent findings on the alterations in thyroid hormones in sleep-deprived rats point to the brain as the essential site of sleep deprivation effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A progressive decline in plasma T4 in sleep-deprived rats is not accompanied by an increase in plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), whereas low plasma T4 is normally a potent stimulant for pituitary TSH secretion (71).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Challenge tests of TSH release from the pituitary by exogenous administration of the hypothalamic peptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) revealed normal stimulated release of TSH and an appropriate increase in circulating T4 and T3 (20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Examination of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus revealed an eventual tripling of TRH transcript levels in most experimental animals, suggesting a compensatory response to low T4, presumably through increased negative feedback to the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Even so, TSH failed to respond to increased TRH biosynthesis (19).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These data suggest that TRH stimulation of TSH is inhibited and that one locus of sleep deprivation's effects is TRH translation or release by the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	21	Relatively little is known regarding other neuroendocrine consequences of sustained sleep deprivation and whether there is broad pituitary or hypothalamic involvement.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	22	 One of the objectives of the present series of experiments was to determine whether chronic sleep deprivation also affects the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Alteration in their pleiotropic functions could provide future avenues of discovery for how sleep deprivation specifically results in health consequences.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Linkage of GH and PRL secretion to non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been repeatedly demonstrated in humans.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Plasma peak GH concentration generally coincides with sleep onset and is delayed if sleep is delayed.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Smaller GH peaks generally coincide with subsequent slow-wave sleep phases (52, 56, 64, 73).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	27	 PRL concentrations are elevated during sleep, even if sleep is delayed (74).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Short-term sleep deprivation of 24 to 36 h blunts the amplitude of major GH secretory periods during that time (10, 11), whereas sleep after sleep deprivation is associated with a return of normal amplitudes (11, 59, 73).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Similarly, GH pulses in rats are abolished during short-term sleep deprivation of 3 h (34).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Whether abolishment would persist beyond 3 h and whether this is an acute reaction are unknown.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The proximal hypothalamic mechanisms regulating GH secretion by the pituitary are growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (somatotropin release-inhibiting factor; SRIF), which operate in a reciprocal manner.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Previous studies have shown that short-term sleep deprivation of 6 to 8 h can reduce the content of GHRH in the hypothalamus (26) and result in increased GHRH mRNA in the PVN and increased SRIF mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (69).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Whether these changes are important to hypophysioportal stimulation of GH secretion is unknown, whereas hypotheses exist for their role in the regulation of sleep behavior (26).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, GHRH binding and receptor mRNA levels are decreased by 50% in the hypothalamus of rats sleep deprived for 8 h, whereas pituitary levels remain unchanged.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These latter findings have been interpreted as indicating downregulation of receptors in response to GHRH release (27).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition to its role in lactation, PRL is a major anabolic hormone and cytokine (5).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Short-term sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation in humans are associated with lower nocturnal PRL levels than when sleep occurs (74, 77).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	38	 PRL is considered to be sleep promoting in laboratory animals (50, 80) and is reduced by 24 and 72 h, but not by 48 h, of sleep deprivation combined (i.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	39	, confounded) with constant forced locomotion (33).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Deficiency of PRL results in grossly reduced immunocompetency in laboratory animals (49), to which sleep-deprived rats share a resemblance.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is also unknown at present whether sustained sleep deprivation affects the secretion of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, which acts on the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Leptin has endocrine actions and pleiotropic effects that include a major role in the regulation of energy balance (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Several lines of evidence suggest a link between this hormone and different pathophysiological changes resulting from sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For example, decreased leptin concentrations occur with decreased fat reserve and impairments of immunity (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	45	 25), which are consequences of sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	46	 On the other hand, increases in leptin secretion are associated with increased sympathetic activation (58), elevated metabolic rate (45), and decreased body weight (12), which are also produced by prolonged sleep deprivation (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Leptin also increases in response to exposure to bacterial cell components (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	48	 30), which would be an expected event resulting from bacterial translocation and efforts to control posttranslocation survival in sleep-deprived animals (22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In humans, substantially reduced leptin concentrations have been found in narcoleptic patients, who have abnormal sleep architecture (36, 60), and mildly reduced leptin concentrations have been found in normal subjects under conditions of acute sleep reduction (62).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	50	The objective of the present studies was to determine whether chronic sleep deprivation changes the regulation of GH, PRL, and leptin, and, if so, the nature of the alterations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The effects of sleep deprivation were determined on concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), because it is the principal physiological mediator of many GH actions, and on concentrations of corticosterone, which in high levels is associated with endocrine abnormalities in other disease states (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To this end, we employed a well-established procedure for producing sleep deprivation (9) and examined its effects on hormonal secretory patterns at intervals during the first two-thirds of the typical survival period for rats, at times before advanced morbidity.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The present results indicate abnormally low concentrations of GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin, but appropriately increased PRL release when stimulated.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These results provide evidence of altered hormonal regulation at the level of the hypothalamus and implicate suppression of anabolic hormones among the important health consequences of sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	55	Rats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg ip), xylazine hydrochloride (2.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Supplementary doses of ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg ip) were provided as needed.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Surgery included implantation of cortical (EEG) and muscle electrodes for electrophysiographic determination of sleep stages and wakefulness, as described previously (9).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	59	 To enable repeated sampling of blood in freely moving animals, a venous catheter was inserted in the external jugular and advanced to the right atrium, as described previously (9, 20, 23).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The catheter was sutured to neck muscles and threaded subcutaneously to exit the scalp at the back of the head, where it was anchored to an electrode head plug assembly.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Catheter tubing was extended up along a 45-cm EEG recording cable attached to a swivel commutator and counterbalanced boom assembly, which permitted daily blood sampling without handling the animal.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Beginning 4 days after surgery, 75 units of streptokinase in 150  microl of heparinized saline were infused (1 ml/min) to fill the catheter lumen after procedures to reduce the occurrence of fibrin clot blockages.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Rats were permitted at least 7 days of recovery from surgery before study.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	65	The rats to be sleep deprived or serve as a yoked comparison were housed in the apparatus described below.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Special food tubes, each with a waste receptacle, afforded accurate measurement of food consumption (9).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Ambient light was constant to diminish the influence of circadian rhythm on factors under study (15).

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The experimental apparatus and procedures used in the present experiments are those of the Bergmann-Rechtschaffen method (9) with subsequent minor modifications.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The method, which has been validated for its selectivity of sleep deprivation (8, 9, 18, 23, 53), features a benign arousal stimulus, freedom of movement, and comparison conditions of partial or full sleep opportunities, described in more detail and illustrated elsewhere (9, 23).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Briefly, two animals are housed under identical experimental conditions on either side of a large, round platform (46 cm diameter) divided by a Plexiglas wall.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	77	 One rat is designated for sleep deprivation, and the other rat is designated as a yoked animal to be subjected to the same experimental variables, yet allowed opportunities to sleep.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Beneath and around the platform is shallow water that serves as a soft boundary.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The rats almost always avoid the water and stay on the platform where they can eat, sleep, and explore normally.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Recording of EEG variables under the rats' freely moving conditions is accomplished by connecting the long recording cable attached to the head electrode assembly to a 360 degrees  commutator and then to a counterbalanced boom assembly.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	81	During a 7-day period of basal measurements, the platform is rotated one time per hour for 6 s to acquaint the rats with platform movement.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The method produces a consistent amount of sleep reduction in our studies (16, 18, 21, 23).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Under baseline conditions, sleep occurs during an average of 53% of the time.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The sleep comprises 48% NREM sleep (comparable to human stages 1 to 4) and 6% paradoxical sleep (PS; also known as rapid eye movement sleep).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	85	 After the baseline period, the experimental period begins.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Detection of sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, by programmed microprocessing of amplitude changes in cortical EEG, cortical theta, and electromyographic variables, results in 6 s of forced locomotion for both rats, which is sufficient to produce arousal.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This is repeated upon each subsequent sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, resulting in wakefulness sustained over 90% of total time.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The other 10% of time consists mostly of transitional sleep and fragmented high-amplitude NREM sleep.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	89	 PS comprises  < 1% of total time.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	90	The yoked rat may sleep when the platform is stationery because the sleep-deprived rat is engaged in behaviors other than trying to sleep.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Yoked animals are awake 58% of the time and obtain NREM and PS sleep during 38 and 3% of total time, respectively.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Each yoked animal is frequently awakened when asleep because sleep normally occupies 50% of the time, and the yoked rat is paired to a sleep-deprived rat that may fall asleep, thus triggering platform rotation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Yoked rats therefore are partially sleep deprived and usually exhibit several signs in the same direction as do sleep-deprived rats but not to the same degree (e.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The yoked animals are considered important in showing that severe morbidity and death in sleep-deprived rats are not due to the experimental conditions extraneous to sleep loss, because these were matched for both groups (54).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In addition, the yoked rats are viewed as comprising part of a dose-response curve, wherein partial sleep deprivation is intermediate to no sleep loss and total sleep loss.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	96	Eight sets of experiments, each one on a pair of sleep-deprived and yoked rats, were carried out for determination of plasma IGF-I, leptin, and corticosterone and changes in food intake and body weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In a subset of four of these experiments, serial blood sampling protocols were followed for determination of basal and stimulated PRL secretion and for the characteristics of pulsatile GH secretion.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The duration of each experiment was a 4- to 6-wk period that included at least 7 days for recovery from surgery, 7 days of baseline conditions, and 15 or more experimental days.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In addition, there were operated animals that were intended to serve as back-up animals in the apparatus during the postsurgery recovery period should a catheter become nonpatent in one of the first two rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Five of these animals were not used for that purpose and continued under study as home cage animals for determinations of plasma IGF-I, leptin, corticosteroids, and changes in food intake and body weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The home cage control animals were subjected to the same daily procedures as the rats housed in the apparatus, except that they were housed in cylindrical cages (30 cm OD; 30 cm high) and permitted uninterrupted sleep.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	107	 A blood sample was drawn and placed in a microcentrifuge tube on ice.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The volume drawn was replaced by an equivalent volume of heparinized saline injected through the catheter to minimize hypovolemia.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Specimens were centrifuged cold (8,000 g for 10 min), and the plasma was pipetted into chilled microcentrifuge tubes for subsequent storage at  to 80 degrees C.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	260	 IGF-I, considered the main effector molecule of GH secretion in many tissues, was also consistently suppressed in sleep-deprived rats by 31 to 42% throughout each 4-day interval of observation, concomitant with robust food intake.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Measurement of circulating IGF-I levels in well-nourished subjects is believed to reflect 24-h secretion of GH from the pituitary gland (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Yoked animals under partial sleep deprivation conditions showed a strong tendency for an overall decrease from baseline GH concentration but showed evidence of relatively well-preserved major GH secretory periods of high-amplitude pulses that were relatively unchanged in duration or frequency.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Taken together, these results provide evidence of diminished GH availability and effector activity in the periphery of totally sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	264	PRL and GH share 40% homology, and GH can substitute for PRL deficiency to some extent (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Sleep-deprived animals also showed a large reduction of 52% in basal circulating PRL during the first few days of sleep deprivation and maintenance of suppressed concentrations during the experimental period.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	266	 By comparison, yoked animals under partial sleep deprivation were variously affected; individual instances sometimes were of increased PRL concentration.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Challenge tests of pituitary secretion of PRL by TRH administration yielded an initial PRL response that was proportional to normal in both sleep-deprived and yoked rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, the total amount of poststimulation PRL secreted over 40 min was significantly less in sleep-deprived rats than during the baseline period, reflecting diminished basal concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Yoked animals under conditions of partial sleep deprivation tended to show the same direction of change in post-TRH PRL concentrations as did the totally sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	270	Both experimental groups of sleep-deprived rats and partially sleep-deprived yoked rats showed significant reductions in circulating leptin concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This finding has effectively ruled out hyperleptinemia as a plausible mediator of sleep deprivation signs, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased energy expenditure, loss of weight, and suppression of IGF-I.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Rather, plasma levels of leptin appeared to reflect energy stores that became inadequate, eventually manifested by the animal's increased food consumption and failure to gain weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Leptin is now considered a critical peripheral hormonal signal of the status of body energy stores to the brain and functions within a long-term homeostatic system balancing food intake and energy expenditure, requiring time to gear up the adaptive responses to a negative energy balance (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	274	Low leptin and increased corticosterone concentrations are reciprocal responses to a negative energy balance during starvation (reviewed in Ref.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In these states, increased glucocorticoids are known to alter functions carried out by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and to suppress immunity (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The present results suggest that this same reciprocal relationship and its associated circumstances do not extend de facto to the sleep-deprived state.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In rats rendered diabetic (4) and in rats fasted for  > 4 to 72 h (46, 75, 76), increases in corticosterone typically are three- to fivefold or more.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In rats in studies of behavioral stress, increases in corticosterone can be ninefold (29, 51), and PRL is increased (67).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	280	 By comparison, in the present study, sleep-deprived rats showed only a mild tendency for increased corticosteroid concentrations by 50%, and not more than was recorded at various times for the other two groups.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This result replicates previous findings (8, 20) and corroborates the mild or unchanged values found in the results of human studies of selective sleep deprivation (37, 38, 70).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Although changes in corticosteroid receptors, sensitivity, and catabolism cannot yet be ruled out, corticosterone concentration in sleep-deprived rats appears consistent with what may be expected to mobilize fuel to support metabolic and cellular requirements.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	283	 As such, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis thus does not appear overactivated, implying that corticosterone has no more than a modulatory role in either the suppression of anabolic hormones or the suppression of immunity in sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	284	Further studies will be necessary to characterize the mechanisms underlying suppression of GH, PRL, IGF-I, and leptin elucidated by the present studies, and inappropriately low TSH, as shown previously (19, 20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, several lines of evidence suggest the hypothalamus is the primary locus affected by sleep deprivation, with possible secondary pituitary involvement.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	286	 For example, under normal conditions, a decrease in IGF-I is associated with an increase in GH release via a long negative feedback loop to the brain (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The specific feedback mechanisms of IGF-I to GH mechanisms in the hypothalamus are not well elucidated but are believed to involve increased inhibitory tone by SRIF or reduced GHRH (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	288	 68), which normally operate in a reciprocal manner to regulate GH secretion.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	289	 For reduced IGF-I negative feedback to the hypothalamus to fail to increase GH would suggest increased SRIF tone and/or decreased GHRH.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Evidence consistent with this framework is a finding by Gardi et al.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	291	 (26) that short-term sleep deprivation in rats reduces amounts of GHRH and tends to increase amounts of SRIF in the hypothalamus, and findings by Toppila et al.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	292	 (69) that show increases in SRIF mRNA in the arcuate nucleus during short-term sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	293	PRL is different from other pituitary hormones in that it has no target organs to supply feedback hormones.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The primary influence on PRL secretion is inhibition by the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In the present study, the absolute concentration of PRL was diminished in the sleep-deprived rats, yet exogenous stimulation by the hypothalamic peptide TRH led to a PRL response that was of comparable relative amplitude to baseline and to comparison conditions, suggesting that PRL synthesis and storage is not the primary reason for low circulating PRL.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	296	 This finding is consistent with previous studies that showed an appropriate pituitary response of TSH release after TRH administration (20) and points to insufficient stimulation of the pituitary during sleep deprivation in a manner that would have resulted in maintenance of normal peripheral PRL concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	297	It is possible that the decrease in circulating leptin, consequent to sleep deprivation-induced negative energy balance, contributes to the reductions in GH and PRL secretion and the inappropriately low TSH concentrations associated with hypothyroxinemia.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Leptin exerts negative feedback directly on the hypothalamus (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Low circulating leptin under conditions of a negative energy balance or induced by experimental means is a potent signal for increased mRNA expression, secretion of neuropeptide Y, and agouti-related peptide in the hypothalamus, and reduced signaling of -melanocyte-stimulating hormone and its precursor proopiomelanocortin (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	300	 These changes are relevant to determining mediation of increased food intake and the causal direction between altered regulation of neuroendocrine peptides and development of a negative energy balance.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Diminished leptin is associated with abolition of GH secretory peaks, and administration of leptin is associated with restoration of those peaks (66) by affecting GHRH and SRIF (78).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Similarly, decreased leptin resulting from food deprivation is associated with decreased circulating thyroid hormones and PRL, and administration of leptin under these conditions reverses both of these hormonal changes (1, 28, 41, 79).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the present results suggest that leptin may not be the necessary and sufficient factor for reduction of these hormones, since partially sleep-deprived rats showed equivalent reductions in leptin secretion but less interference with pituitary hormone secretion.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	304	 A growing body of evidence indicates central integration of leptin signaling and central control over leptin concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	305	The hormonal changes in sleep-deprived rats may be viewed either as dysfunctional or as adaptive responses.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	306	 On the one hand, there is abundant evidence that diseases with a central locus, such as hypothalamic dysfunction, can produce peripheral effects and changes in neuroendocrine regulation (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	307	 On the other hand, low leptin and suppression of anabolic hormones may be viewed as adaptive responses to a negative energy balance, as evidenced by the progressive food intake and body weight changes in sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Suggestions that the central effects of sleep deprivation should be considered dysfunctional rather than adaptive come from examples that contrast sleep-deprived and starved rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Quite opposite to starved rats, declines of T4 and T3 in sleep-deprived rats are consistent with metabolic activation and not with downregulation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The ratio of T3 to T4 is dramatically increased (8), indicating a strong preference for the most metabolically active form of thyroid hormone without an increase in reverse T3 in a metabolically inactive pathway.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Also, in contrast to starvation, sleep deprivation is associated with a 100-fold increase in the T4-to-T3 conversion enzyme 5'-deiodinase type II in brown adipose tissue (3), which is consistent with experimental hypothyroidism (13, 61), further suggesting that central changes in regulation of anabolic hormones produce a state in which peripheral mechanisms show activities consistent with compensation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	312	The clinical implications of suppression of these hormones are based on their many pleiotropic actions.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Deficiency in PRL, induced by hypophysectomy that reduces circulating PRL to 50% of control values, is associated with normocytic anemia, grossly reduced immunocompetence, decreased body weight, and several other abnormalities (49) shared by sleep-deprived animals.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	314	 GH has widespread effects on the growth and metabolism of most tissues, including by increasing DNA, RNA, protein synthesis, and mitosis (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Suppression of leptin would be expected to extend beyond the effects on energy balance to include numerous effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	316	 For example, leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice show many endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including decreased body temperature and immune defects (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Decreases in IGF-I would be expected to diminish some or many of its effector functions that include autocrine and paracrine growth factor mediation of mitosis, differentiation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis in many tissues (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Administration of IGF-I during burn injury improves body weight and gut mucosal weight, stimulates mucosal DNA and protein content, and reduces the incidence of bacterial translocation (32).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The endocrine and immune systems are intricately linked, and the hormonal changes may be contributing to decreased resistance to infectious disease in this animal model.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Deficiencies in GH, IGF-I, PRL, thyroid hormones, and leptin induced by sleep deprivation affect health and provide one explanation for the absence of localization of specific sleep deprivation effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Low basal PRL and lack of reciprocal relationships between IGF-I and GH, and between leptin and corticosterone, point to the hypothalamus as a locus for sleep deprivation effects, where key factors interact before presentation of integrated signals to the pituitary.

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	6	Recent studies have identified distinct neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (13) that generate hunger (14, 15).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (16), is another neuropeptide that prominently induces feeding (17, 18).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The hypothalamic circuit between the LHA and the arcuate nucleus is thus an important component of the central system controlling feeding behavior (19).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this circuit, judging from studies that genetically disrupted the orexigenic neuropeptides, MCH neurons in the LHA play a key role.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Mice lacking the gene encoding MCH are lean (20), whereas mice overexpressing the MCH gene are susceptible to obesity (21).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It has also been suggested that MCH neurons are involved in the glucosensing system, because hypothalamic MCH mRNA levels are increased by hypoglycemic conditions such as fasting, insulin injection, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment (14, 22, 23).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In contrast to MCH, mice lacking the gene encoding prepro-orexin or NPY display normal growth (24, 25, 26).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	13	It is probable that sex differences in feeding behavior are at least in part attributable to sex differences in the neurons involved in feeding behavior.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Because MCH neurons in the LHA play an important role in the regulation of feeding behavior, we hypothesized that there might be a sex difference in the activity of MCH neurons in the LHA during fasting and/or after glucose injection.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In support of this view, hypothalamic MCH neurons are suggested to be involved in estrogen-induced weight loss in male rats (27).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We therefore examined the response of MCH neurons to an iv injection of glucose after 48 h of fasting in adult male and female rats, using the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity as a marker of neural activity.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	17	 On the assumption that a sex difference in MCH neurons existed, we also examined whether it could be affected by gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone and/or estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	18	In the present study, we used pCREB as a marker for neural activity increased of the generally used c-Fos, because an increase in the expression of c-Fos needs transcription and/or translation to occur (28), it takes a long time to see changes, and it would be difficult to examine acute changes in response to glucose.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In contrast, CREB is a constitutively expressed transcription factor and can be immediately activated by phosphorylation via a cAMP- and calcium-dependent cascade (29, 30).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, we thought that pCREB was a suitable marker to examine neural activity that changes within a short period in response to dynamic changes such as blood glucose concentrations.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	21	Determination of blood glucose and insulin concentrations To determine changes in blood glucose and insulin concentrations after glucose injection (400 mg/kg), intact males, orchidectomized (ORX) males, females at proestrus and diestrus 2, and ovariectomized (OVX) females were implanted with a silicone cannula in the right atrium under ether anesthesia.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Male and female rats were castrated 4 wk before the experiment.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	23	 After cannula implantation, they were fasted for 48 h and injected with 400 mg/kg glucose dissolved in 200  microl saline after the first blood sampling of 100  microl.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Control rats were injected with the same volume of saline.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thereafter, blood was sampled 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection though the same cannula.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	26	 An equal volume of heparinized saline (2 IU/ml) was injected after each sampling.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	27	 As another control, blood samples were obtained from intact males, ORX males, females at proestrus, and OVX females that were not fasted.

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The injection was made through the silicon cannula in the right atrium as described above.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The dose of glucose used in the present study was based on a previous study which showed that this treatment could reverse the inhibition of pulsatile LH secretion caused by insulin-induced hypoglycemia (31).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	33	 For females, three groups, composed of rats at diestrus 2 (D2 group), proestrus (P group), or estrus (E group), were prepared to check the effect of the stage of the estrous cycle.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The rats in the D2 group had been fasted from the day of estrus, those in the P group had been fasted from the day of last diestrus 1, and those in the E group had been fasted from the day of last diestrus 2.

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In the OVX groups, post hoc comparison showed that the ratio of double-stained neurons in the Fast+Glucose group was not different from that in the Fast+Saline group (P  >  0.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	159	5) and that the ratio of double-stained neurons in the Fast+Glucose group was significantly larger than that in the Fed+Saline group (P  <  0.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These results indicated that ovariectomy increased the ratio of double-stained neurons 5 min after glucose injection, but both testosterone and estrogen replacement blocked the ovariectomy-induced increase in the ratio of double-stained neurons in female rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	161	Although hypoglycemia caused by treatments such as fasting, insulin injection, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose injection increases the expression of hypothalamic MCH mRNA (14, 22, 23), there is little information on the second messenger system that would be stimulated by hypoglycemic conditions.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	162	 For example, Fos expression was increased in the LHA by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but there were few MCH neurons that expressed Fos protein (22, 37).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Thus, it is unclear whether Fos proteins are involved in the control of the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA by hypoglycemia.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In experiment 1, we showed that under normal feeding conditions in male and female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined, approximately 10% of MCH neurons expressed pCREB-immunoreactive nuclei in the LHA, indicating that only a small population of MCH neurons is active in the LHA.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, we found that fasting for 48 h increased the ratio of double-stained neurons to approximately 40% in both sexes.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Furthermore, we showed that this fasting-induced increase was independent of the presence of testosterone or estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This is the first demonstration that MCH neurons express pCREB in their nuclei in response to fasting and is in good accord with the results of a previous study showing that fasting for 48 h increased pCREB levels in nuclear extracts from the rat hypothalamus, although which neurons expressed the pCREB was not shown (38).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	168	 An analog of cAMP and agents that increase levels of endogenous cAMP and promote phosphorylation of CREB (29) were reported to elicit a vigorous feeding response when microinjected into the LHA (39).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Thus, pCREB can be a reliable marker of activation of MCH neurons by 48-h fasting, and phosphorylation of CREB, probably promoted by an increase in cAMP, may contribute at least in part to the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	170	 We thus suggest that there is no sex difference in the fasting-induced activation of MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	171	We also examined changes in the activity of MCH neurons after glucose injection in 48-h fasted rats in experiment 1 and found that a significant decrease in the ratio of double-stained neurons was induced after 5 min only in female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In contrast to female rats, MCH neurons in male rats failed to respond to glucose within 5 min.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Additional time-course studies in experiment 2 demonstrated that MCH neurons in male rats responded to glucose 15 to 30 min after glucose injection, whereas those in female rats, at the stage that was most insensitive to glucose, MCH neurons responded after 5 to 15 min.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In this study we found a clear sex difference in the response of MCH neurons to glucose; the response of MCH neurons to glucose was delayed in male rats compared with that in female rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	175	 This is not due to differences in blood glucose concentrations, because there was no sex difference in blood glucose concentrations after glucose injection between intact male and female rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Furthermore, this is not due to sex differences in insulin secretion in response to glucose, because there was no sex difference in the effect of castration on insulin secretion and thus it could not explain the results of experiment 3.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	177	 One possible reason for this delay in the decrease in pCREB may be that the sensitivity of MCH neurons to glucose in male rats is less than that in female rats, and thus MCH neurons do not respond to an increase in glucose concentrations in blood, resulting in a delay of the decrease in pCREB.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	178	 According to the glucostatic theory that an increase in glucose in blood is a signal for meal termination (33), the dietary glucose may inactivate the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons and induce meal termination more rapidly in female rats than in male rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This may account for the sex difference in meal size, which is smaller in females than in males (1, 2).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Although glucose-sensing neurons may respond to physiological changes in blood glucose and regulate integrative metabolic functions, such as counterregulatory responses, food intake, and metabolic rate (40), the glucostatic theory by itself is not sufficient to explain the complex regulation of feeding behavior (41).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Glucose is, obviously, only one of several peripheral metabolic signals involved in the regulation of feeding behavior under physiological conditions (42).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Hence, we speculate that the inactivation of MCH neurons by metabolic signals after feeding is faster in females than in males.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	183	We currently do not know how glucose acts on MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, judging from an electrophysiological study showing that some neurons in the LHA respond to changes in glucose concentration in vitro (43), a direct effect of glucose on MCH neurons is likely.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Effects of afferent signals from glucose sensors localized at different central and peripheral structures are also likely (41, 44).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In the hypothalamus, NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus have been shown to be glucose-sensitive neurons in an in vitro electrophysiological study (45).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Considering the hypothalamic circuit involving the LHA and arcuate nucleus (19), it is probable that glucose affects MCH neurons indirectly via NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	188	We also found in the present study that the response of MCH neurons to glucose varied depending on the stage of the estrous cycle, i.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	189	 the magnitude of decrease in the number of double-stained neurons after glucose injection was greater at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	190	 An additional time-course study confirmed that the ratio of double-stained neurons at diestrus 2 decreased 15 min after glucose injection to approximately 10%, which was similar to the levels at proestrus and estrus 5 min after glucose injection, indicating that the response of MCH neurons to glucose at diestrus 2 was the most delayed.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	191	 As discussed above, if the decrease in the activity of MCH neurons is related to meal termination, it follows that meal termination occurs more rapidly at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In support of this, the meal size was smaller at proestrus or estrus than at diestrus (2, 4).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Therefore, MCH neurons may also participate in the fluctuation of feeding behavior during the estrous cycle.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	194	Our findings in experiment 3 indicate that the sex difference in MCH neurons is at least in part attributable to the presence of gonadal steroid hormones in adults.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	195	 That is, the presence of testosterone in males and that of estrogen in females are critical to the male- and female-type responses of MCH neurons to glucose.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In male rats, we found that orchidectomy significantly enhanced the response of MCH neurons to glucose, but testosterone replacement attenuated the effect.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Because orchidectomy decreased food intake (46), and this effect was reversed by testosterone replacement in ORX rats (7, 47, 48), we speculate that testosterone attenuates the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals and then increases food intake in males.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In contrast, estrogen replacement did not cause any significant effect on orchidectomy-induced enhancement of the response to glucose in male rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This result is in good accord with a report that food intake in ORX rats is relatively insensitive to the influence of estrogen compared with that in OVX rats (8).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The results of the present study in male rats therefore suggest that estrogen could no longer enhance the response of MCH neurons to glucose, because orchidectomy caused the response to reach its maximum.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	201	In female rats, ovariectomy attenuated the response of MCH neurons to glucose, and estrogen replacement prevented ovariectomy-induced attenuation of the response.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These results are in good accord with previous studies in which ovariectomy in adult female rats increased food intake (7, 46), and this effect was reversed by estrogen replacement (6).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Thus, it can be easily hypothesized that estrogen enhances the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals in females and causes decreases in food intake and body weight.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In support of this, estrogen inhibited the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA of female (49) and male (27) rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In contrast to the effect of testosterone in ORX rats, testosterone enhanced the response of MCH neurons in OVX rats as estrogen did.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	206	 This effect of testosterone in OVX rats could be explained by postulating that testosterone enhances the response of MCH neurons after being converted to estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In support of this speculation, it has been suggested that in male rats, the reduced food intake and weight gain seen during high-dose testosterone treatment are due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen (8).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In light of previous reports that females are more sensitive to the effect of estrogen on food intake than males (8, 50) and males are more sensitive to the effect of testosterone on food intake (47, 50), the present study indicates that the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons in females is not testosterone-induced attenuation, but is estrogen-induced enhancement.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In males, in contrast, the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons is not estrogen-induced enhancement, but is testosterone-induced attenuation.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Hence, the present study may provide a neural basis for the sex difference in feeding behavior, although the mechanisms of action of estrogen and testosterone need to be determined in future studies.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	211	Recent reports demonstrating that estrogen attenuates neuroendocrine responses to hypoglycemia in women (51) and female rats (52) suggest that estrogen enhances the effects of glucose in the brain.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In light of the results of the present study, estrogen may enhance glucose transport and its metabolism in the brain (53, 54, 55).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This suggests that one mechanism by which estrogen exerts its widely reported protective effects in the brain (56) is by enhancing glucose transport and metabolism.

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Peripheral or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ghrelin releases growth hormone, stimulates food intake, and increases body weight in mice, rats, and humans (1 to 8).

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These findings have suggested that ghrelin plays a physiological role in the meal initiation.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	7	The neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-containing neurons localized in the ARC have been implicated in the stimulation of food intake injection of NPY into the hypothalamus of rats potently stimulates food intake (10), and NPY secretion in the hypothalamus is increased during fasting (11).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Regarding a possible link between ghrelin and the NPY neurons in the ARC, it has been shown that GHSR mRNA is expressed in 94% of the NPY neurons in the ARC by double-labeling in situ hybridization histochemistry (12).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Systemic or ICV administration of ghrelin causes the ARC neurons to express Fos and Egr-1 (3,13 to 15) and 90% of these Fos-positive neurons express NPY mRNA (13).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Moreover, ghrelin increases the expression of NPY mRNA (3 to 5), and ICV administration of a NPY Y1 antagonist suppresses the ghrelin-stimulated food intake (3 to 5,15).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These findings suggest that the NPY neurons in the ARC could be an important effector for the orexigenic action of ghrelin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	12	The second messenger systems for GHSR have not been fully elucidated.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Signaling pathways for artificial GHS that act through GHSR in pituitary cells have been investigated.

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	15	 GHRP-6 stimulates GH release from rat pituitary cells by activating protein kinase C (PKC) (17,18).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, the post-GHSR pathway could involve Gs and/or Gq proteins.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, the intracellular signaling for ghrelin s orexigenic action in the effector neurons is not well understood.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to examine whether ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC and, if so, to explore the signal transduction mechanisms, with special attention toward Ca2+ signaling.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	19	Leptin is an adipocyte-derived, potent anorexic peptide.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The leptin receptor is present in NPY neurons of the ARC, and leptin exerts its anorexic effect partly through suppression of NPY neurons (19).

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Orexin-A and -B are orexigenic peptides produced in cell bodies located in the lateral hypothalamus (20).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The orexin-1 receptor is localized in the NPY-containing neurons in the ARC (21) and orexin-induced feeding is inhibited by NPY Y1 and/or Y5 receptor antagonists (22 to 24), suggesting that orexin could elicit feeding via these NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Therefore, the second aim of the present study was to examine whether a subset of the NPY neurons in the ARC could serve as the common target for ghrelin, leptin, and orexins.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	25	We found that ghrelin increases [Ca2+]i in 80% of NPY neurons via mechanisms involving protein kinase A (PKA) and N-type Ca2+ channels, and that the majority of the ghrelin-activated NPY neurons are also regulated by orexin-A and leptin.

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There are two possible explanations for the role of PKA.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	177	 First, the basal activity of PKA may be required for ghrelin to produce Ca2+ signaling.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Second, the ghrelin-GHSR system may activate the Gs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA cascade, which in turn leads to the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The PKA-mediated facilitation of the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase have been indicated in the cardiac muscle and in pancreatic ss-cells (28,33).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	180	 It has been shown that PKA is indispensable for CREB phosphorylation and cAMP response element-mediated gene expression in the NPY neurons in the fasted state (34).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Ghrelin could couple fasting to the activation of PKA because the release of this peptide is greatly stimulated by fasting (9).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	182	 These findings in the present study and by others indicate that PKA is important for the ghrelin-induced activation of NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Whether the ghrelin-induced Ca2+ signaling in NPY neurons depends on the basal PKA activity or requires activation of PKA by this peptide remains to be clarified.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	184	In the present study, ghrelin and orexin increased [Ca2+]i in the same neurons of the ARC.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The majority of the ghrelin-responsive neurons (80%) also responded to orexin, and vise versa (86%), showing that the two populations of responders highly overlapped.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The ghrelin- and orexin-responsive neurons included eight NPY-containing neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The orexin-1 receptor is reportedly expressed on  > 90% of NPY neurons (35).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a subset of NPY neurons that serves as the common target for ghrelin and orexin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It has been shown that fasting and lowering glucose concentrations increase the level of ghrelin (9) and activate orexin neurons (26,36), suggesting that the release of the two peptides are regulated in parallel.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Our finding indicates that ghrelin and orexin may also cooperate at their common effector site, the NPY neurons in the ARC, which could result in an efficient stimulation of the NPY-mediated neural signaling and feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	191	We found that leptin suppresses the ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increase in the majority of the ghrelin-responsive neurons (79%).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The ghrelin- and leptin-responsive neurons included seven NPY-containing neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Thus, the NPY neurons in the ARC are regulated reciprocally by ghrelin and leptin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This is in accord with the report that 57% of the Fos-positive cells in the ventromedial ARC due to intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin were also immunoreactive for the leptin receptor (37).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The recently reported action of leptin to antagonize cAMP elevation (38 to 40) is a possible mechanism by which leptin counteracts the effect of ghrelin that is dependent on cAMP-PKA as demonstrated in the present study.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The action of leptin could also involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (38 to 41).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Furthermore, we found that the orexin-induced [Ca2+]i increase in NPY neurons of the ARC is inhibited by leptin (T.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, NPY neurons are regulated directly and cooperatively by ghrelin, orexin, and leptin, the important regulators of feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	199	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to elicit Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	200	 This could serve as the major neuronal signaling mechanism by which ghrelin stimulates NPY release and thereby feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The ghrelin-responsive neurons are highly overlapped with orexin- and leptin-responsive neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Ghrelin is synthesized mainly in stomach endocrine cells but has also been identified in other tissues, including the hypothalamus (7, 10, 12).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, increases food intake and appetite, and promotes body weight gain (17, 37, 38).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recent findings suggest that ghrelin might be involved in the regulation of sleep in humans by promoting slow-wave sleep (SWS) (35).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	9	Plasma ghrelin levels increase during fasting and decline within 1 h after food intake (4).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, ghrelin levels have been observed to increase during the night in sleeping subjects and to decrease in the morning some hours before awakening and, thus, before breakfast (4).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	11	This time course in sleeping subjects suggests the existence of a mechanism regulating ghrelin production that is not dependent on food intake.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Possible candidates are the circadian rhythms regulating numerous endocrine networks, such as, for example, the secretion of cortisol or leptin (5, 13), which, in turn, are related to insulin and blood glucose levels (27).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Alternatively, sleep might directly influence ghrelin production, as it has been demonstrated, for example, for the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary (28).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	14	To dissect diurnal variations from sleep-related influences on ghrelin production, we performed a study on the 24-h pattern of ghrelin secretion in healthy males.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	15	 During two experimental sessions from 0900 to 1000 the following morning, the subjects were allowed to sleep or were sleep deprived in balanced order.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Nocturnal ghrelin secretion was compared between the two conditions using a within-subjects design.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The study was performed using a balanced, randomized, within-subject design.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Every subject participated in two 24-h experiments.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Once, the subjects were totally sleep deprived, and the other time they were allowed to sleep from 2300 to 0700.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To adjust to the experimental settings, the subjects spent the night before each session (2300 to 0700) in the sleep laboratory.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	22	 At 0800, electrodes for EEG, electromyogram, and electrooculogram recordings were placed according to standardized criteria (20).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The subjects remained in a semirecumbent position and received standardized meals at four different time points.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The subjects received a standardized diet from our hospital kitchen with 1,800 kcal/24 h containing 30% fat, 60% carbohydrates, and 10% protein.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The subjects were not allowed to eat additional food.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Measurements were started at 0900.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Lights were turned off, and the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 in the sleep condition only.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	30	 During sleep deprivation, another person stayed continuously in the same room with the subject to prevent lapses into sleep.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Standardized meals were served at 0800, 1200, 1900, and again at 0800 the next morning.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	54	 To avoid too many a posteriori tests, which would imply a strong reduction of the level of significance, only five time points between 2300 and 0700 were included (2300, 0100, 0300, 0500, and 0700) in the ANOVA.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	55	 For each hormone, the averages of the measured plasma concentrations before the sleep period were considered as baseline values, and conditions were tested about significance in them by a separate ANOVA.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	56	 If, for some hormone, baseline plasma concentrations differed significantly between the two conditions, then all corresponding values in the sleep period had to be normed with the baseline values before the ANOVA application.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Additionally, ghrelin levels were compared between conditions by a recently developed methodology for the comparison of the stability of hormone concentration curves (36).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Finally, the peak level of hGH between 2300 and 0300 was determined and associated with the ghrelin concentrations between 2300 and 0300 and their area under the curve in this interval as well by using Pearson's correlation coefficient.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The level of statistical significance was set to 0.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	76	Sleep-related growth hormone secretion is probably caused by an increased production of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) acting on the pituitary (28).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Ghrelin, in contrast, is produced mainly by the stomach and other splanchnic organs (1, 14).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Small quantities might also be produced in the hypothalamus (for review see Ref.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	79	 9), but these are very unlikely to contribute to systemic levels (34).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Hence, it is almost certain that the increased ghrelin levels that we found in sleeping subjects are due to peripheral production.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Yet it is unclear at present how the brain might act on ghrelin-producing cells.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Despite the positive correlation between ghrelin and hGH secretion, a causative role of hGH is unlikely, because a number of studies demonstrated that hGH administration does not affect ghrelin levels (2, 8, 16, 30).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Studies investigating the interaction between ghrelin production and feeding suggest an influence of vagal cholinergic efferents on ghrelin production and transmission of the ghrelin signal to the brain through vagal afferents (29, 30).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These studies indicate a negative influence of the vagus on ghrelin secretion.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Therefore, the increased parasympathetic tone occurring during sleep (30) is unlikely to explain increased ghrelin secretion, because the opposite would rather be expected.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Hence, although the present results clearly demonstrate increased ghrelin levels during sleep, the question remains to be solved how the sleeping brain stimulates ghrelin secretion.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	87	 At first glance, it is not easy to understand why the production of an appetite-stimulating hormone should be increased during sleep.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, the interaction among metabolic, endocrine, and sleep-regulating networks is complex, and ghrelin has numerous functions.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Ghrelin has recently been shown to increase SWS, and this effect is probably dependent on the GHRH receptor (33, 35).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Therefore, ghrelin might represent a peripheral feed-forward signal to support SWS initiation and/or maintenance during the first hours of night sleep in concert with central SWS-promoting actions of GHRH (18).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Similarly, ghrelin being a potent growth hormone secretagogue (11) might reinforce the central GHRH signal for enhanced hGH production.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This idea is supported by the correlation between hGH and ghrelin production shown in Fig.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Studies on the interactions between sleep and neuroendocrine factors date back to the late 1960s (e.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	94	 31), but it was only very recently that a particularly intriguing link between sleep and the regulation of appetite became evident.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Orexins, hypothalamic peptides that were initially thought mainly to regulate food intake but also to have potent arousing properties (21), play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (a sudden, short-lasting loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions), and an acquired complete loss of hypothalamic orexin production in the hypothalamus in most patients (21).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In addition to sleep-related symptoms, patients display various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and hypoleptinemia (23 to 25).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Like ghrelin plasma levels, orexin cerebrospinal fluid levels are increased at night (6), and ghrelin-induced food intake is mediated by orexinergic pathways (22).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Therefore, it might be of great interest to investigate ghrelin under baseline conditions, in association with sleep and sleep deprivation and in association with meals in narcoleptic patients.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the present study further supports the idea that ghrelin is a novel, important player within the sleep-neuroendocrine interplay.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	7	Conversely, it was shown that odors regulate food intake behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Indeed, Le Magnen (7) showed that rats increased their food intake if, once satiated, they were presented with differently odorized foods.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, it is an everyday experience for humans and animals that food odors are attractive before feeding, whereas the same stimuli may become neutral or even aversive after feeding.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Sensory olfactory inputs are thus crucial in nutrition behavior of humans and animals.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Olfactory system involvement begins with the food search step because olfactory sensitivity levels provide the signal detection that allows the animals to follow the concentration gradient toward the food source.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Then the olfactory system contributes to the palatability analysis of the food; the appetence of the animal for food is defined by its internal physiological status.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	13	Hypothalamic feeding centers (8) analyze metabolic cues and in turn regulate the appetite.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These centers send direct and specific projections to olfactory structures, especially on the olfactory bulb (OB), the first integrative relay of the system (9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The discovery of orexin A (OXA) and B (OXB) or hypocretin I and II (11, 13), two peptides derived from the same prepropeptide and contained in neurons localized in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area, provided new insights into the regulation mechanisms of feeding.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Orexin (OX) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area are controlled by changes in circulating nutriment because they are activated by natural hypoglycemic conditions (14) or insulin-induced ones (15), whereas they are inhibited by glucose and signals related to the ingestion of food (15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These data led to the classification of OX neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area as glucose-sensitive neurons (20).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, OX neurons are stimulated by an increase of circulating lipids.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus, OX neurons are negatively related to the glucose level but inversely related to circulating fat (21), the latter relation suggesting a role of this peptide in the increased activity associated with a high-fat diet (22, 23).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	20	The majority of physiological studies (for reviews see Refs.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	21	 24 and 25) indicate that orexins are potent stimulators of food intake (26, 27), with OXA being more effective than OXB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover these peptides interact with various neuronal pathways to potentiate apparently divergent functions (for review see Ref.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Currently two closely related G protein-coupled receptor types termed type 1 orexin receptors (ORX1) and type 2 orexin receptors (ORX2) have been identified.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although OXA has the same affinity for ORX1 and ORX2, OXB has a 10-fold greater affinity for ORX2 (13, 29, 30).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	25	 (31) demonstrated that in the OB, immunoreactive OXA varicose fibers were mainly around glomeruli, in mitral cell and granule cell layers.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Glomeruli are spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery in which primary axons synapse with mitral cells; they are delimited by GABAergic interneurons called periglomerular cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Granule cells are deep GABAergic inhibitory interneurons.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The localization of OXB labeling paralleled that of OXA.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, immunoreactivity to ORX1 and ORX2 were detected only in some mitral/tufted cell bodies, ORX2 labeling being very faint (31).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This localization may support, at least partly, data reporting that OB mitral cell reactivity to odors was modulated according to hunger and satiation states in rats (3).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	31	Our exploration of OX actions on the OB network should provide a better understanding of the cross-talk between olfactory and metabolic cues in the brain, as being at the basis of nutritional behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This study analyzed specifically OX action on mitral cells, its putative cell targets in the OB (31), through an in vitro patch-clamp study.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To do so, the actions of OXA and SB-334867-A (ORX1 antagonist; GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, Essex, UK) were tested on the spontaneous activity and excitability of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, an immunocytochemical study was done to clarify cellular and subcellular localizations of ORX1, the most expressed orexin receptor in the OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition, because no data are available on the early ontogenetic development of orexin innervation and orexin receptors in the OB and because electrophysiological studies on slices were performed on 10- to 25-d-old-rats, the presence of ORX1 was evaluated through RT-PCR experiments on rats and adults that were 10 to 25 postnatal days (P) old.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Altogether, the data are expected to provide some enlightenment about the neurochemical modulatory effect of OXA on OB activity and to reveal what cell types of the bulbar network are the targets of orexin innervations.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, this first functional study is expected to give rise to preliminary hypotheses dealing with the role of the olfactory system in the regulation of food-intake processes.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	258	Furthermore, from our anatomical results, it appears that the cellular localization of ORX1 is similar in preweaning and adult rats.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	259	 At light microscopic level, our immunocytochemical study confirms the localization of ORX1 in mitral/tufted cell bodies reported by Caillol et al.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	260	 At the ultrastructural level, the localization of orexin receptors has been not widely studied; there is only one recent publication in the arcuate nucleus (45).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Our results are in agreement with this study showing that ORX1 was localized in cell bodies as well as at the pre- and postsynaptic levels.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In our study, a part of the labeling is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a local synthesis of ORX1.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	263	 ORX1 immunoreactivity was also shown in mitral/tufted cell dendrites running in the EPL and in bodies and processes of external tuft cells and periglomerular and granule cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Thus, ORX1 seems to be expressed by most OB cell categories but not in a systematic and homogeneous way.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Indeed, ORX1 labeling is homogeneously distributed neither along the mitral cell layer nor in the glomerular layer.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Interestingly, ORX1 immunoreactive mitral cell bodies were found in most cases adjacent to ORX1 immunoreactive glomeruli.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Although such an observation needs to be further documented, it may suggest some columnar organization of orexin receptive cells in the OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	268	To optimize in vitro neuron survival, electrophysiological recordings were performed on 10- to 25-d-old rats, a period surrounding weaning.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	269	 During this period, ingestive behavior evolves: the type of food changes from a liquid diet full of fat to a solid diet with less fat.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	270	 However, in our experimental conditions, we observed that weaning is progressive because developing rats can both suck at their mothers  nipples and eat solid food, which is available ad libitum (for the dam).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Furthermore, most of recordings (75%) were made from 20- to 25-d-old rats, and no obvious variability due to different ages of rats was observed in mitral cell reactivity to OXA.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	272	Our results show that OXA modulates mitral cell activity.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Only 61 mitral cells (30%) were shown to be modulated by OXA, with 7 and 23% being depolarized and hyperpolarized, respectively.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These results are in agreement with our immunocytochemical observations, which indicate that rather few mitral cells were ORX1 immunoreactive.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	275	OXA is shown to exert two opposite effects on two distinct sets of mitral cells: either a direct depolarizing effect, by inducing a TTX-insensitive inward current, or an indirect hyperpolarizing effect.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	276	 However, both OXA effects were blocked by SB-334867-A, which demonstrated the involvement of ORX1 (Fig.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	278	 OXA action on mitral cells in the rat OB network.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	279	 From the olfactory mucosa, olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) send their axons to the OB terminating in glomeruli (GLO), spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Within glomeruli, these axons synapse with primary dendrites (pd) of mitral cells (MC).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Mitral cells make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with the two categories of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons; through their pd with PGs and through their secondary dendrites (sd) with granule cells (GC).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	282	 So mitral cell activity can be modulated through a double-GABAergic control before sending their axon (a) to the olfactory cortex.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	283	 ORX1 is found to be expressed by subsets of MC, PG, and GC (cells in dark gray) and tufted cells (Tc, in light gray), these receptors being localized in the soma and processes of these neurons.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Left, The diagram schematizes the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA on MC: OXA, by acting through ORX1, is hypothesized to depolarize GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, PGs, or GCs (in dark gray), which in turn would inhibit MCs (in white) via a GABA release acting on GABAA receptors localized on the MC.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Within glomeruli, a part of OXA indirect hyperpolarizing action can also be ascribed to action of GABA released by PGs on GABAB receptors localized both on ORN axons or MCs (pd).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Right, The diagram is schematizes the direct depolarizing action of OXA on MC; OXA, by acting through ORX1 expressed by a subset of mitral cells, is hypothesized to depolarize MC (dark gray).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	287	  The hyperpolarizing action of OXA was sufficient to completely shut off mitral cell spontaneous activity and was antagonized by the voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker TTX.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The latter observation supports that OXA action was indirect.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Such OXA indirect effects were reported in other brain area like the substantia nigra (34), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (46), HYPO (47), or raphe nucleus (43).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	290	 These OXA effects were either excitatory or inhibitory.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	291	We show that the OXA hyperpolarizing response was partly antagonized by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This result indicates that GABAergic interneurons are involved in the OXA-induced hyperpolarization of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Our immunocytochemical observations that some PG and granule cell bodies express ORX1 support that these GABAergic interneurons could be contacted by orexin fibers localized mainly in glomerular layer and feebly in granule cell layer (31).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Indeed, PG and granule cells, the main interneurons of these two layers, are mainly GABAergic (49, 50) and have been shown to inhibit mitral cells by activation of GABAA receptors (51, 52).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Along the same line, GABAergic interneurons that are excited by OXA may act on metabotropic GABAB receptors.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Indeed, GABAB receptor activation was reported elsewhere to both abolish completely spontaneous activity in mitral cells and decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks applied in the olfactory nerve layer (33, 53, 54).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	297	In the present study, OXA was also observed to decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	298	 For such an effect, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on extrasynaptic presynaptic GABAB receptors located on primary afferent axons (55, 56) in which it is strongly suspected to act by depressing neurotransmitter release (54, 57, 58, 59, 60).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	299	 On the other hand, for decreasing mitral cell spontaneous activity, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on GABAB receptors located either on the soma or dendritic intraglomerular tuft of rat mitral cells (55, 56).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	300	 One of the mechanisms by which GABAB would silence the spontaneous activity may be that GABAB would slightly hyperpolarize mitral cells at rest, shifting the cell polarization from the up-state to the down-state, the latter signaling a steady silent state (61).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Because dopamine and GABA are colocalized in some PG interneurons (62, 63, 64), dopamine also would be a good candidate to support the OXA indirect inhibition of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Consistent with this hypothesis is that, in the frog OB, dopamine was found to inhibit mitral cell spontaneous activity (65).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	303	 A coaction of GABA and dopamine cannot be ruled out.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	304	An especially interesting fact is that our electrophysiological results are fully consistent with those of an in vivo study (48).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The authors recorded unit extracellular activity of mitral cells in anesthetized rats, whereas they applied OXA directly on the OB surface or in the lateral ventricle.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Both types of applications were shown to induce a decrease in spontaneous rate of some cells or an increase in others distinct cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Noteworthy is that in both in vivo and in vitro studies, OXA induces two types of opposite actions on mitral cell spontaneous activity.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	308	As a conclusion, our study brings out information on the ontogenetic expression of orexin receptors in the rat OB and clarifies ORX1 structural and ultrastructural localization within the network.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	309	 In addition, our in vitro recordings demonstrate that OXA acts on mitral cells both directly and indirectly inducing apparently opposite effects.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The direct depolarizing effect could be mediated by ORX1 located on mitral cell bodies and dendrites.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	311	 ORX1 located on PG and granular cells could be responsible for the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA via GABA-induced release.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	312	Altogether our data provide new insights for apprehending some of the mechanisms by which the olfactory system is involved in the regulation of food-intake behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In hungry animals, hypothalamic OX neurons are stimulated by hypoglycemia (14) and probably increase their release through centrifugal pathways.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Our electrophysiological data detail OX action in OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Indeed, by acting both directly by increasing output neuron s background activity and, indirectly through inhibitory interneuron networks, OX can both depress and excite mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	316	 These two opposite actions are shown to occur in two distinct mitral cell sets.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	317	 OX may provide for selective and dual actions in olfactory information processing, favoring mitral cells involved in the food-odor processing and silencing others that are not involved.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	318	 This duality of action could result in increasing signal to noise ratio and may increase olfactory detection power.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	319	 This hypothesis fully agrees with behavioral experiments, which are in progress by our research team.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Indeed, preliminary results indicate that olfactory detection thresholds of rats are enhanced by OXA intracerebral injection.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	3	One of the early dreams of the human genome project was the goal of personalized medicine.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The vision was that each individual would have a compact disk containing their own unique DNA sequence, guiding myriad decisions on lifestyle, disease prevention, treatment and conceivably even career choice.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	5	 At present, DNA sequencing technology is nowhere near cheap enough or fast enough to allow this dream.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Nevertheless, genotyping technologies have made dramatic strides over the last decade, and these technologies may now be fast enough to allow interrogation of all relevant disease alleles in any given individual.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The feasibility of this approach depends critically on the allelic structure of human disease genes.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	8	 If all 30 000 genes make important contributions to disease susceptibility, and there are 1000 alleles for each gene, then a total of 3x107 genotypings will have to be reliably performed a daunting prospect.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, if only 1000 genes make appreciable contributions to human disease, and each of these genes has only 4 relevant alleles, then the number of genotypings to be performed is only 4000 highly feasible.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In this review, we look at the present knowledge on the allelic complexity of human disease genes, as well as providing a brief glance to the future.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	11	View larger version (25K):    Figure 1.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This three-dimensional space provides an aid to visualizing possible structures of polymorphism for human disease genes.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For monogenic disorders, rare diseases (green bar) have complex allelic spectra (high number of alleles per locus), while common diseases (yellow bar) have simple spectra (low number of alleles per locus).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Special cases (gray bar) exist in situations such as heterozygous advantage and population bottlenecks.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	15	 For common complex disease traits, the situation is less clear.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Two extreme models are the interaction model (CD/CV hypothesis, dark blue bar) and the genetic heterogeneity model (red bar).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, two other extreme models are also formally possible: a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), and a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles (magenta bar).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Considerations of human population genetics (2) suggest that one of the four extreme models, a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), is unlikely.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, present data are insufficient to confidently place complex disease traits between the remaining three extremes, indicated by the two-dimensional gray surface.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In this figure, the following examples are employed (2, 10): monogenic (rare) retinoblastoma; monogenic (common) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (South China); monogenic (special case) ss-thalassemia (Sardinia); complex (interaction model) Alzheimer's disease (speculative); complex (genetic heterogeneity model) colon cancer (speculative).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	21	 No known examples yet exist for the two hypothetical cases of common complex diseases caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles or a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For clarity, the disease frequencies for both the monogenic and common complex disorders have been rounded to 10-1, but all are within one order of magnitude of the known frequency.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In the cases of the complex diseases, Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer, the assigned values for the number of loci and the number of alleles per locus are highly speculative.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For the purposes of the figure, it has been assumed that Alzheimer's disease is an example of the interaction model, whereas colon cancer is an example of the genetic heterogeneity model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Although both assumptions are conjectural, there is some evidence in favor of the genetic heterogeneity model for cancer (10).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	26	  Two extreme models are usually envisaged for complex disease traits (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	27	 One idea is that common alleles at a handful of loci interact to cause disease.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This is referred to as the interaction model or the common disease/common variant (CD/CV) hypothesis.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The competing notion is that rare alleles at numerous loci can each single-handedly cause the disease.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This is referred to as the genetic heterogeneity model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Two other extreme models are also formally possible: complex disease traits are caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles, or they are caused by a large number of loci with a large number of alleles (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	32	 One of these last two alternatives (a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles) is rendered unlikely by considerations of human population structure (see below).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, between the remaining three extremes, complex disease traits could occupy any middle ground.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	34	There is a large amount of evidence suggesting a dramatic expansion of the human population 18 000 to 150 000 years or 700 to 6000 generations ago.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This resulted in an increased effective population size from 104 individuals to the present size of 6x109.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Assume expansion of one allele of a rare disease gene, and one allele of a common gene (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	37	 With some notable exceptions, the available evidence suggests fairly similar mutation rates for most genes, 10-6 to 10-5 per gene per generation (3 to 7).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	38	 For the rare disease, the number of individuals in the expanded population is still small, and hence in relative terms they are quickly swamped by newly mutated alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In contrast, the population reservoir for the common disease gene is large, and it takes a long time for these alleles to be taken over by new mutations.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In addition, in the face of similar mutation rates, the lower prevalence of rare diseases implies a higher allele disappearance rate (negative selection) for these diseases than for common diseases.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Both of these effects (reservoir effect and selection pressure) imply that after the population expansion, allelic spectra became diverse much more quickly for the rare diseases than the common.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In the long run, however, it is expected that the spectra for both rare and common diseases will become equally diverse (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Reich and Lander estimate that an intermediate stage presently exists in the population, where rare diseases have very diverse allelic structure but the common disorders have simple structure.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A prediction of this theory is that rare disorders will largely consist of recent alleles whereas common disorders will consist of old (ancestral) alleles.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	46	 (A) A dramatic population expansion leads to increased numbers of individuals with a single allele of a rare (5 squares) and common (25 circles) disease gene.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Because the rare disease gene is under strong negative selection, three alleles disappear in the population, and are replaced by three new alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Thus, only 2/5 (40%) of alleles represent the ancestral allele.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In contrast, the common disease gene is under much less strong negative selection, and only one allele is lost to be replaced by three new alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The proportion of ancestral alleles is hence 24/27 (89%).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Consequently, the common disease gene has a much simpler allelic structure in the present population than the rare gene.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The population expansion leads to proportionate increases of a single allele of a common disease gene (red) and a rare disease gene (blue).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In the present human population, the rapid loss of alleles and smaller population reservoir of the rare disease gene has lead to the allelic spectrum of this gene becoming relatively much more diverse than the common gene.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	55	 However, in the far distant future (at equilibrium), the common disease gene can be expected to catch up with the rare gene, and the allelic spectra of both genes will be equally diverse.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Three lines of evidence supporting the common disease/common variant hypothesis   Another valid test of the CD/CV hypothesis is to examine the genetic complexity of quantitative traits related to common disease, such as blood pressure, body mass index and plasma lipids.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	58	 With the exception of mutations of the LDL receptor that underlie familial hypercholesterolemia (a relatively common monogenic disorder), most of the known variations associated with the traits are due to a small number of common alleles (Table 1).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	59	A corollary of the CD/CV hypothesis is that each individual will carry susceptibility genes for numerous disorders.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This point is difficult to examine systematically in humans, although, clearly, older individuals frequently suffer from a host of common maladies.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	61	 A more convincing example is provided by surveying inbred mouse strains for differences in disease-related traits.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Table 1 lists some common diseases and related traits differing between the two inbred strains DBA/2J and C57BL/6J.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Many of these traits have been analyzed in genetic crosses between the two strains, and are known to be due to multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	64	 One might argue that, since the mice have been maintained by continuous brother to sister mating for many generations, numerous mutations have been fixed, and these are responsible for the trait differences.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A counter argument to this, however, is the fact that a number of the loci observed in the DBA/2JxC57BL/6J cross are also observed in crosses with other strains, and, in some cases, these loci are syntenic with human loci for the corresponding traits (9).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	66	Apart from these examples, the rapid fall-off in disease rates in relatives of affected observed for most common diseases argues for the interaction model and against the heterogeneity model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In addition, many common diseases exhibit a high ratio of relative risk for monozygotic twins to that for dizygotic twins, also consistent with the genetics of the multifactorial threshold model (2,10).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	68	 For example, the common disease familial combined hyperlipidemia (prevalence 1 to 2%) exhibits an apparent dominant mode of inheritance through many generations, yet is clearly very complex (11).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Furthermore, the inheritance of cancers is, in some ways, more consistent with a heterogeneity model (see below).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	70	Other challenges to the CD/CV hypothesis, also in the area of cancer, are presented by the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (12).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These loci contribute to a relatively common genetic disorder, but have many different rare mutations, even in the Ashkenazi population (see above).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In addition, even when the CD/CV hypothesis is true, disease genes may be dominated by a few alleles, but have large numbers of minor alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In the case of cystic fibrosis, 67% of disease alleles in the Caucasian population are accounted for by a single mutation.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Nevertheless, the total number of known disease alleles exceeds 100 (8).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	75	It is pertinent to note that whereas our understanding of the kinds of variations that occur in Mendelian diseases is extensive, our knowledge of the variations that explain common disease is very limited.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Relevant to transcriptional regulation, one approach to the identification of common disease gene candidates is to survey cases and controls using expression array analysis.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In this regard, it is noteworthy that about one-third of the known common disease genes (Table 1) affect expression levels (8).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	78	Interesting evidence that the inheritance of cancers is distinct from that of most common diseases has been provided by Risch (10).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	79	 With few exceptions, different cancers have roughly the same familial relative risk (FRR), although the FRR increases with early age of onset.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Traditionally, most studies attribute a large environmental component to cancer.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The relevant evidence includes such observations as dramatic shifts in cancer incidence due to population migrations.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, careful evaluation of twin and family studies suggest that genetics also plays a large part in cancer risk (10).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A key quantity is RMD, the FRR ratio between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The idea is that MZ and DZ twins have a comparable sharing of environmental factors, so any difference in concordance rates between MZ and DZ twins must reflect genetic factors.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	85	 For disease due to a single rare dominant gene, RMD=2, and for a recessive rare gene, RMD=4 but diminishes toward 2 if the allele is very common.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	86	 For multiple loci, RMD can become very large.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	87	 For most cancers, RMD2, compared with much higher ratios for many complex diseases such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, and autism.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These data are consistent with either rare dominant alleles or additive gene effects for cancer, rather than an interactive, multigenic model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	89	Estimates of the extent of LD have been obtained by sampling various restricted genomic regions (17), as well as over 51 autosomal regions spanning a total of 13 megabases (18).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In addition, somatic cell genetics has been used to analyze LD over the entire chromosome 21 (19).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	91	 From LD sampling, the average distance over which useful LD was preserved was 50 to 60 kb.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, there was considerable variability, and in some loci, LD was found as far away as 500 kb, while in other regions, no useful disequilibrium was found.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The chromosome 21 study found considerable linkage disequilibrium, with long blocks of conserved haplotypes.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Interestingly, greater than 80% of the haplotype structure could be defined by less than 10% of the SNPs.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Based on such studies, it appears that the extent of linkage disequilibrium in the genome will be region- and population-specific.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	96	The dark side of linkage disequilibrium has been revealed by a recent study to identify genes on chromosome 5 involved in Crohn's disease (20).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Although a region of linkage disequilibrium associated with the disease was identified, a lack of recombination events within the relevant haplotype block precluded identification of the responsible gene.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Thus, although the existence of large haplotype blocks is good news from the point- of- view of cheap diagnostics, it may hinder definitive identification of the responsible genes and any associated biological insights.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In this situation, the use of alternate populations may come to the rescue, allowing subdivision of large regions of linkage disequilibrium.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	100	 For narcolepsy, it was possible to identify a recombination event in a Japanese family that broke up a haplotype block in the HLA region, allowing finer mapping of the responsible gene (21).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Alternatively, scientists may have to rely on animal models, such as the mouse, to ultimately identify the causative gene.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	102	Although particular alleles and haplotypes may be numerically rare in the population as a whole, it is nevertheless likely that each individual will harbor a significant number of such variants.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In addition, estimates of gene mutation rates imply that each individual has about three de novo gene mutations within their genome.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus, even if the interaction model proves true for most loci, personalized medicine will still benefit from a more individually tailored genotyping.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	105	The distinctions between the interaction and genetic heterogeneity models can be restated using the following question:  In the human population, would we rather know all rare  severe  genetic mutations (e.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	106	 nonsense, frameshift and non-synonymous), or would we rather know all common variations?  With present limitations on the speed of genotyping and lack of knowledge of the genetic causation of common human disease, the best choice between these two alternatives is unclear.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Of course, the optimal situation would be to know the answer to both questions.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, the need for ever more rapid genotyping and sequencing technologies is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	5	Spontaneous cases of Labrador retrievers suffering from a congenital form of hereditary myopathy (hereditary myopathy of the Labrador retriever, HMLR) were first described in the USA in 1976 (24) and later on by other groups across the world (25 to 29).

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Furthermore, this transcription mainly led to abnormal transcripts with either premature stop codons or codons encoding a truncated protein.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Furthermore, we observed a homozygous tRNA-like SINE insertion within PTPLA exon 2 of affected dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In the human genome, Alu elements are the most abundant SINEs and numerous Alu insertions into genes have been associated with hereditary disorders (36).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Not all of these cases have been demonstrated to be directly causative for the disease, but the lack of other detectable mutation and the rarity of such Alu insertions strongly suggest that they are a likely candidate.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In the case of the Labrador retriever centronuclear myopathy, two lines of reasoning suggest that the SINE exonic insertion is responsible for the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	169	 First, the SINE insertion identified in our pedigree of Labrador retriever perfectly segregates with the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	170	 We have sampled 47 healthy dogs from 15 pure and mixed breeds and failed to detect this insertion.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In particular, the SINE insertion was not found in nine healthy French Labrador retrievers unrelated to our experimental pedigree.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The presence of the retroposed SINE within PTPLA is therefore highly correlated with the segregation of centronuclear myopathy in French Labrador retrievers.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Second, and most compellingly, we show that the repeat element insertion severely affects the splicing of the corresponding SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We provide strong evidence that the tRNA-like SINE is by itself responsible for cumulative transcriptional abnormalities based on the four following features: (i) the SINE can be properly spliced, although at a low level ( < 1%); (ii) partial exonization of the SINE; (iii) exon-skipping involving several exons and (iv) the total amount of PTPLA transcripts was markedly reduced.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Taken together, these observations show that the exonic SINE insertion within the PTPLA gene in cnm to / to  dogs acts as a hypomorphic mutation.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Existing data and ongoing experiments should help us to confirm that the SINE insertion within PTPLA is a causative event leading to canine centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	177	 First, our experimental pedigree has been established from two affected Labradors that are unrelated for 11 generations (29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	178	 We have found that both dogs are homozygotes for the same insertion within PTPLA exon 2.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Genotyping additional affected Labradors coming to the Alfort clinics will allow us to reinforce the association between the SINE insertion and cnm.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	180	 We also believe that close clinical and histopathological relationships exist between the centronuclear myopathy found in French Labrador retrievers and the HMLR identified in dogs from other countries (29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Although not precisely determined yet, the number of generations from common ancestors of affected Labradors from the USA and France is higher than between affected French dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Amplifying the SINE insertion in affected Labrador retrievers from the USA or from any other country will reinforce that the SINE insertion is the causative-disease mutation with founder effect.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Finally, characterization of mutations in PTPLA with similar phenotype either in transgenic mice or in human patients affected by autosomal recessive cnm would provide strong evidence that PTPLA plays a central role in the etiology of centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	184	In human, the related X-linked myotubular myopathy has been attributed to truncating or missense mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin (8,9,44).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Classical and tissue-specific gene-targeting inactivation of Mtm1 in the mouse confirmed that the absence of muscular expression of Mtm1 does not affect myogenesis but induces lethal degeneration of skeletal muscles by 4 weeks of age (45).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Myotubularin is a phosphatase with dual activity that specifically dephosphorylates subpools of phosphatidylinositols (PIs) (10,11,13,14).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	187	 PIs are implicated in a number of physiological processes including cell proliferation, death, motility, cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular vesicle trafficking (46).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Ptpla was first annotated in mouse and then in human on the basis of a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase-like catalytic site, with a proline replacing arginine in the consensus (HCX26X2R) sequence (32,33).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	189	 PTPLA protein shares no sequence homology with the MTM1 protein family (data not shown) but, quite surprisingly, canine cnm-associated histopathological features closely resemble those observed in human and murine XLMTM.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Hence, PTPLA protein may be involved in the same PI-dependent functional signaling pathway as MTM1, at least in skeletal muscle.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This hypothesis should be addressed by testing the putative PTPLA phosphatase activity and/or investigating functional interactions between PTPLA and MTM1 proteins by analyzing, for example, the subcellular localization of MTM1 in the muscles of affected Labrador or the subcellular localization of PTPLA in the muscles of Mtm1 to / to  mice.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	192	In the work presented here, we show that the SINE insertion detected within PTPLA exon 2 is associated with various transcriptional features.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	193	 First, the SINE insertion is flanked by a direct duplication of the insertion site, which is characteristic of the retroposition mechanism of SINEs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	194	 As this duplicated sequence contains an AGGT tetranucleotide, the SINE acquired an uncommon intron-like status [5'-splicing donor site (GT) and 3'-splicing acceptor site (AG)] allowing its proper excision.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Although it generates complete and normal mature PTPLA transcripts, this mechanism seems to be poorly efficient as only 1% of wt PTPLA transcripts were detected in muscles of affected cnm to / to  Labradors compared with healthy cnm+/ to  dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Precise elimination of the SINE observed in vivo was reproduced ex vivo.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In addition to this exceptionally fine removal of parasitic sequence, the repeat element insertion has other deleterious consequences on the transcription of the SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Indeed, we provide evidence that the splicing machinery recognizes cryptic splice sites within both the SINE and exon 2 sequences, which yields a mature elongated transcript containing a partially exonized SINE sequence.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Concomitantly, exon-skipping involving either exon 2 alone or in combination with other exons results in several PTPLA truncated transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Again, this PTPLAalf-associated aberrant exon-skipping could be undoubtedly attributed to the SINE sequence by itself as it was reproduced in ex vivo splicing experiments.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Alu insertions have been associated with other diseases (36 to 39,42,47).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These insertions were either associated with exonization of repeat element sequences or with specific exon-skipping.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Strikingly, the work presented here highlights that these two mutational mechanisms, previously reported as independent defects, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The systematic dichotomy observed between exonization and exon-skipping mechanisms may depend on splicing regulatory elements, either contained by the inserted Alu sequence or located in the genomic vicinity.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Alternatively, technical limitations might have prevented the identification of concomittant subtle transcriptional aberrations in previously reported studies.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Owing to the transcriptional defects associated with the SINE insertion in PTPLA, it is tempting to speculate that this repeat element contains splicing regulatory motifs that are strong enough to drive both exonization and exon-skipping.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Furthermore, SINE-associated exon-skipping previously reported only refer to skipping of a single exon.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	208	 For example, Alu insertion in exon 22 of human BCRA2 gene induces alternative skipping of this exon, which may play a role in the development of breast cancer (48).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Surprisingly, in Labradors affected by centronuclear myopathy, not only the SINE-targeted exon 2 but also exons 3, 4 and 5 are abnormally skipped in some muscular transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Introns 2 and 3 of canine PTPLA are 183 and 76 bp in length, respectively.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	211	 We may thus assume that the SINE hampers the spliceosome machinery to recognize normal consensus splicing sites by modifying spatial conformation of the transcripts and/or specific interaction of RNA with regulatory proteins.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Abnormal skipping of exons 3 and 4 would thus result from their closeness with the SINE.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Finally, all but one PTPLA abnormal transcripts bear a disruption of reading frame.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Princeps studies in yeast and human have paved the way for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that eliminates transcripts containing premature termination codons (49,50).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The reduced total amount (35%) of PTPLA transcripts detected in muscles from cnm to / to  dogs using real-time RT to PCR analyses could therefore result from NMD leading to the degradation of PTPLA abnormal transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	216	Deleterious effects of repeat elements have already been reported in dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	217	 For example, an intronic SINE insertion within the Hypocretin-receptor-2 in Doberman pinschers induces exon-skipping, leading to narcolepsy (51).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	218	 To date, relatively few canine diseases have been characterized at the genomic level.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	219	 With the examples of narcolepsy, hemophilia and centronuclear myopathy, diseases associated with insertion of repeat elements seem well represented.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The low average divergence of SINEC_Cf repeats in dogs and the high percentage of bimorphic loci with respect to the presence or absence of SINE insertion (6.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	221	5% between dogs of different breed) indicate that expansion of SINEs is a recent and still active process (52; Ewen Kirkness, personal communication).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The high incidence of disease-associated insertions in dogs may then be explained by the recent expansion of repeat sequences, which represent 31% of the canine genome (52).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	223	 By comparison, finding 406 gross insertion and duplication mutations in the Human Genetic Mutation Database that contains 44 090 characterized human mutations suggests that Alu insertions, which occur at a lower rate, hardly contribute to 0.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Besides their deleterious consequences on gene expression, insertions of SINEs in dogs and their observed bimorphism may contribute to interbreed or intrabreed modulation in gene expression accompanying physiological phenotypic diversity (52).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The functional effects of PTPLA mutation reported in the present paper disclose a rare example of a single SINE insertion with several modifications of RNA processing, which provides a molecular basis for the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of gene control by mobile elements (reviewed in 53).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	226	In conclusion, the work presented here shows that the exonic SINE insertion within the PTPLA gene in cnm to / to  dogs acts as a hypomorphic mutation and recapitulates most of the SINE-dependent mutational molecular mechanisms.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	227	 These results also illustrate the relevance of the canine model in genetic studies.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Indeed, major advances in the development of canine genomic and genetic resources have been reported recently or will be soon available: (i) an integrated 4249 marker FISH/RH map (31); (ii) the publication of the 1.

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	4	AGING IS ASSOCIATED WITH A progressive decrease in appetite and food intake (14, 15).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The decline of food intake that often happens in healthy elderly persons predisposes them to pathological weight loss and protein-energy malnutrition, thereby raising morbidity or mortality.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The reasons for the decline in food intake are multifactorial.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although the sensitivity to CCK, a classic neuropeptide that shows a satiety effect, is enhanced in old animals (21), the mechanism underlying this effect has not been elucidated (12).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	8	Orexins, which are appetite-stimulating peptides, were discovered in 1998 (18).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Classified into orexin-A and orexin-B, these neuropeptides are endogenous ligands for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Orexin-A (33 amino acids) and orexin-B (28 amino acids) peptides are produced by a single precursor polypeptide, preproorexin.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Two orexin receptor subtypes have been identified: the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) is selective for orexin-A, whereas the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) is a nonselective receptor for both orexin-A and -B neuropeptide agonists.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	12	Orexins are expressed almost exclusively in the lateral hypothalamic area (18), a region classically implicated in the control of mammalian feeding behavior (19).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	13	 When administered centrally to rats, these peptides stimulate food consumption dose dependently (18).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, the preproorexin mRNA level is upregulated on fasting (18).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These findings suggested that the orexin neuropeptide system plays a significant role in feeding behavior, and orexins are therefore categorized as orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) factors.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Moreover, we have reported (13) that orexin-A stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion via the vagal efferent nerves and that orexin-A may be an important candidate as a mediator of the cephalic phase of the secretory response to feeding.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	17	In the present study, to determine the mechanism of the age-associated decrease in appetite and food intake, we compared food intake between young and old male rats as an indication of the stimulatory effect of intracerebroventricular administration of orexins.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We also examined the protein expression of orexin receptors in the hypothalamus (the most important region of the brain for the regulation of food intake).

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	133	To examine the mechanism underlying the effect of orexin-A, we measured the protein levels of its receptor in the hypothalamus and compared those levels between young and old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The protein level of OX1R was significantly lower in the old rats than in the young.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The band intensity of old rats was 45% less than that of young rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This result indicates that the decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for the lack of an orexin-A stimulatory effect on food intake in old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	137	 However, we cannot answer the question of why an 50% reduction in the protein level of OX1R would yield a 100% reduction in behavioral response.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Because several neural pathways are involved in the orexigenic action of orexins (16), the aging change of these pathways might be implicated.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	139	Another hypothesis is that the age-related decrease in food intake by orexin-A is a secondary phenomenon due to the decline in the ability of orexin to increase arousal.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This problem has been discussed in previous reports (16, 22, 24), although we did not record the awakening time in the present study.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	141	 (16) reported that changes in food intake are independent of changes in sleep/wake cycles.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Moreover, a selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 reduced orexin-A-induced food intake (4).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Previously, abnormality of OX2R is shown to be a cause of canine narcolepsy (7).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Because OX2R expression did not decrease with age in our study, the decrease in food intake in old rats does not seem to depend on the level of arousal.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	145	A previous study (6) reported that the central administration of orexins stimulated water intake significantly.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, we observed that the two higher doses of orexin-A did not significantly increase water intake even in young rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The differences between the study by Kunii et al.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	148	 (6) and our present study were the different doses of orexin-A applied and the experimental conditions.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	149	 (6) determined the effects of 3- to 30-nmol orexins, whereas we used 0.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	150	25 to 3 nmol; also, they measured water intake without feeding, whereas we measured water and food consumptions simultaneously.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	151	A recent study (17) reported that preproorexin gene expression and contents of orexins in the rat brain decreased in the course of aging.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	152	 There is also a report (25) that a site-specific decrease in immunostaining for orexin was observed in the locus coeruleus of old cats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These reports indicate deterioration of the orexin system in old animals.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We did not measure the orexin-A content in the brain, so whether or not that content decreased with age remains unknown.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, because orexin-A can bind to both OX1R and OX2R and the specificity of OX1R for orexin-A is high (18), the age-associated change in OX1R could be biologically more important than that in orexin-A.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Our observation leads us to propose that the age-associated decline in OX1R may be related to the age-associated decline in appetite and food intake.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	157	On the other hand, orexin-B showed no significant effect in either young or old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The present observation is compatible with the previous studies (2, 8) in that central orexin-B is a less effective stimulant of food intake than orexin-A.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The protein level of OX2R was not significantly different between young and old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	160	 (23) measured mRNA levels of OX1R and OX2R in eight brain regions of 3-, 12-, 18-, and 24-mo-old C57BL/6 mice.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	161	 They observed a declining trend of the OX2R mRNA level in the hypothalamus, although there is no age-related change in OX1R mRNA expression.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These differences might be due to the species difference, although the precise mechanism is unknown.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	163	In conclusion, the function of the orexin system in stimulating feeding behavior was reduced in old rats compared with young ones.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for orexin-A's lack of stimulatory effect on food intake in old rats.

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	9	The LHA has long been implicated in feeding behavior and initial observations highlighted the role of orexins in stimulating appetite (2).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, it is now clear that orexins are also involved in the regulation of sleep, arousal, locomotor activity and neuroendocrine responses (3, 4), and therefore their orexigenic activity may be secondary to other behavioral traits that influence feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In behavioral studies, orexins can modulate stress-related behavior such as grooming, and chewing of inedible material (5, 6, 7).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Orexin-containing neurones project from the LHA to many CNS areas involved in mediating stress including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the locus coeruleus (8, 9, 10).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	13	 OX-1 and OX-2 receptors are widely and differentially distributed throughout the CNS including the PVN, suprachiasmatic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, and ARC of the hypothalamus and also the locus coeruleus and hippocampus (11, 12, 13, 14).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These areas have individual and synergistic involvement in regulating circadian rhythm and behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	15	The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the principal pathways mediating neuroendocrine responses to stress.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Hypothalamic neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulate the release of the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide ACTH from the anterior pituitary, with consequent release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Corticosterone (CORT), the principal glucocorticoid in rodents, acts through glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and mineralocorticoid receptors within the hippocampus to negatively regulate HPA axis activity (15).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Many studies have demonstrated that orexins can influence HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations are elevated in rats after intracerebroventricular (icv) OX-A administration (5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This is accompanied by the induction of c-fos mRNA (17) and AVP and CRF mRNAs (20) in the parvocellular subdivision of the PVN.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition, in vitro studies have revealed release of CRF peptide, but not AVP, from hypothalamic explants (19).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	22	 OX-B has also been reported to stimulate HPA axis activity (16).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Orexin expression in the rat LHA is increased after stressors such as immobilization (23), cold stress (23), or hypoglycemia (24).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Reduced secretion of plasma ACTH and cortisol is reported in patients with narcolepsy (25), a condition associated with orexin deficiency.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Therefore there is considerable evidence that orexins can modulate HPA axis activity and that orexin expression is responsive to alterations in HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	26	It is well documented that glucocorticoid administration stimulates feeding and conversely that glucocorticoid deficiency results in loss of appetite and weight loss because adrenalectomized (ADX) rats exhibit decreased feeding, which can be reversed by CORT administration (26, 27).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Therefore, orexins may not exert a direct effect on appetite regulation within the hypothalamus but may act indirectly to stimulate feeding through increased CORT secretion.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	28	 To test this hypothesis, we designed experiments to investigate the effect of ADX with or without CORT replacement on OX-A-induced feeding to determine whether endogenous CORT is involved in OX-A-induced feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We also investigated the effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression in the morning and evening to determine whether orexin expression, which exhibits a diurnal rhythm of expression (28, 29), may be correlated with the diurnal rhythm of HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Finally, we investigated the effects on orexin expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunological stressor that elicits a robust and prolonged activation of the HPA axis (30, 31).

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This may be due to the suboptimal doses of OX-A employed over a dose range 1.

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These findings may also be a result of the shorter period of food intake studied (maximum of 2 h, compared with a maximum of 4 h in our study).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	201	 (39), it seems evident that ADX is associated with decreased food intake at both higher doses of OX-A at the 2-h time point, but the very small increase in food intake in response to OX-A in sham rats does not permit the ADX effect to reach significance.

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This, together with the ability of physiological concentrations of CORT to reverse the effects of ADX on orexin-induced food intake, increases our confidence that endogenous glucocorticoids exert physiologically relevant control over orexin-induced feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	208	Our observation that orexin-induced food intake is decreased by about 60% in ADX rats is evidence that a significant component of eating behavior is dependent on endogenous CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It is known that CORT can directly stimulate appetite (41), but the indirect effects on appetite of CORT mediated through hypothalamic neuropeptides is not well understood.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	210	 A number of mechanisms may be invoked to explain the relationship among CORT, OX-A, and food intake.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	211	 CORT may stimulate endogenous orexin expression through an action at glucocorticoid receptors within the LHA or intermediary nuclei, it may act via orexin peptide release within the PVN/ARC areas of the hypothalamus, or CORT may stimulate food intake itself consequent to orexin activation of HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	212	 There is also a possibility that CORT may exert its effect on food intake via other peptides that modulate appetite rather than directly through orexins.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	213	 There is a well-defined pathway of glucocorticoid feedback on CRF expression in the PVN and release from the median eminence (42).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	214	 CRF inhibits food intake and therefore increased CORT could increase food intake through its inhibitory action on CRF.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Orexin-induced feeding is enhanced by a CRF receptor antagonist, suggesting CRF involvement (43).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is also a possible mediator of orexin-induced feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Glucocorticoid manipulation results in a marked similarity between orexin and NPY effects on feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	218	 ADX reduced NPY-induced food intake by about 60%, similar to the effects of ADX on orexin-induced feeding, and this was reversed by CORT replacement (44).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	219	 NPY is the most potent known inducer of food intake (45), and orexin-induced feeding can be blocked by a Y1 receptor antagonist (46).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Therefore, it is conceivable that orexin exerts its principal glucocorticoid-dependent actions on food intake through NPY, and it is the direct effects of CORT on NPY, not on orexin expression, which explains our observations.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, we have observed a 40% increase in food intake in response to OX-A in ADX rats in the complete absence of CORT, which is strong evidence for a glucocorticoid-independent central pathway of direct orexin-induced food intake that may not be mediated through NPY.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	222	In situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed that prepro-orexin expression was restricted to the LHA, with extensions to the perifornical nucleus and posterior hypothalamic areas, in agreement with previously reported studies (37).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	223	 A novel finding from the distribution study was that prepro-OX mRNA expression measured from coronal sequential sections running 1044  microm throughout the LHA shows considerable differences between sections, emphasizing the importance of consistent choice of sections for hybridization in measuring prepro-OX mRNA in the LHA between treatment groups.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This observation confirms the need to use anatomical markers to ensure consistency of sectioning between samples.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	225	We observed an up-regulation of morning but not evening prepro-OX mRNA in the LHA after CORT administration.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Increased blood CORT may up-regulate orexin expression through the large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LHA (47, 48).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Emulsion staining established that there was no significant difference in the number of cells expressing prepro-OX between treatment groups.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Therefore, the increases in prepro-OX mRNA that we observed in response to CORT represent increased expression of prepro-OX within cells of the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	229	 There was a slight increase in prepro-OX mRNA expression in the sham group in the evening, compared with the morning, although this was not statistically significant.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Plasma CORT levels were significantly increased in the evening, compared with the morning, in sham animals in agreement with previous studies demonstrating diurnal variations in HPA axis activity (49).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, it is important to note that CORT levels were similar in both the morning and evening replacement groups and not significantly different from morning levels in the sham animals.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	232	 It is possible that the increase in evening prepro-OX expression, although not statistically significant, may be a consequence of the circadian increase in endogenous circulating CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This increase may be sufficient to mask any further stimulatory effects on orexin expression by exogenous CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Further investigations of interrelationships between the circadian cycles of HPA axis activity and orexin expression will undoubtedly shed light on regulatory mechanisms controlling the highly integrated modalities of sleep-wake patterns and feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	235	We found no effect of ADX alone on orexin expression in the LHA, which suggests that basal orexin expression in rats is not under tonic regulation by endogenous glucocorticoids.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In contrast, a decrease in prepro-OX mRNA expression 5 d after ADX has been reported (50).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, no data on HPA axis activity were presented in this study, so it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of ADX surgery.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In addition, there was no information about where sections were sliced from within the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Given the variability of prepro-OX expression, which we observed throughout the LHA, it is important that the choice of section is justified and well defined.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The decrease in orexin expression after ADX was reversed by dexamethasone replacement (50), an observation that is consistent with our data demonstrating CORT up-regulation of orexin expression in sham animals.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	241	 A decrease in prepro-OX mRNA levels in the LHA 10 d after ADX has also been reported, a phenomenon that could not be reversed by CORT (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	242	Discrepancies between our data and published reports on the effects of ADX on prepro-OX mRNA expression in the LHA (39, 50), and lack of agreement on the effects of exogenous glucocorticoids, may be due to methodological differences.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Our experiment used a 7-d ADX with CORT replacement, compared with previous studies using 5 d ADX with dexamethasone (50) and 10 d ADX with CORT (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	244	 It is instructive to compare these discrepancies with the literature on NPY expression after ADX.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Although there is a general consensus that NPY is up-regulated by glucocorticoids, reports differ on the effects on NPY expression of eliminating endogenous cortisosterone by ADX.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Short-term ADX (4 d) did not alter NPY peptide levels in the ARC or PVN (51), whereas the same group observed that long-term ADX (12 d) deceased NPY peptide levels in these areas (52).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	247	 ADX (7 d) had no effect on NPY immunoreactivity in most hypothalamic areas, one notable exception being the PVN (53).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	248	 A longer-term ADX (12 d) had no effect on prepro-NPY mRNA in the ARC (54); peptide levels were not measured in this study.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Either dexamethasone or CORT replacement up-regulated NPY mRNA, but dexamethasone was much more potent (53).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Therefore, any effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression, as with NPY, may be dependent on the period of ADX, the concentration and type of glucocorticoid, whether orexin peptide or mRNA is measured, and how specifically defined is the hypothalamic site selected for analysis.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	251	Finally, we have demonstrated that a single injection of LPS, an immunological stressor, can up-regulate prepro-OX mRNA expression in the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Increases in prepro-OX mRNA have been reported in response to other stressors that robustly stimulate the HPA axis such as immobilization and cold stress (23) and hypoglycemia (24).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The present study expands this repertoire of stressors to include immune- mediated stress.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	254	 LPS is a potent stimulator of HPA axis activity and subsequently CORT release, and it is possible that the increase in prepro-OX mRNA may be a result of increasing blood CORT concentrations.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Further work is necessary to elucidate whether increased orexin in response to LPS is a direct result of LPS-induced CORT release or indirectly in response to increased cytokines.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	256	We may briefly speculate on the physiological importance of increased orexin expression in response to an immunological stimulus.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Orexins have been demonstrated to have analgesic properties in inflammatory-induced hyperalgesia in which the OX-1-receptor antagonist SB-334867-A reduces OX-A-mediated analgesia (55).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This suggests that there may a hypothalamic mechanism involving orexin as an analgesic agent during neurogenic pain.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	259	 It is also possible that, after onset of inflammation in which the acute phase response to LPS plays a crucial role, it is so important to maintain homeostatic control of the peripheral release of inflammatory cytokines through increased secretion of CORT that an immunological stimulus will activate all hypothalamic components that drive HPA axis activity, including orexins.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	260	In conclusion, these data establish that OX-A-induced feeding and prepro-OX mRNA expression are sensitive to glucocorticoid manipulation.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Up-regulation of prepro-OX expression in response to CORT may be circadian related because levels were increased in the morning but not the evening.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, further studies will be required to determine the mechanisms underlying these data.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	263	 These observations highlight the interdependence of orexins and HPA axis activity and provide further insights into the role of glucocorticoids in regulating centrally mediated orexin-induced feeding and orexin expression within the brain.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	3	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA), a disorder characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, is one of the most common respiratory disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 24% and 9% among middle-aged American men and women, respectively (92).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Obesity in modern Western society is also extremely common.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	5	 As of 2002, nearly one-third of US adults met clinical criteria for obesity, and this prevalence appears to only be increasing (27).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	6	That obesity and OSA often colocalize is of no surprise.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Other than perhaps male gender, obesity is the strongest risk factor for the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Relative to those with a stable weight, a 10% increase in weight over 4 yr is associated with a sixfold increase in the risk of developing moderate to severe OSA (58).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Weight loss trials have found significant reductions in apnea severity with moderate weight loss (69, 74).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, the mechanisms by which obesity causes OSA are not completely defined, with many potential pathways hypothesized (93).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Perhaps the most obvious is that fat deposition in the neck and airway lumen may lead to increased collapsibility of the upper airway.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, adiposity in the chest and abdomen may result in reductions in lung volumes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Recent studies suggest reduced lung volume may independently predispose to upper airway collapse (37).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Another possible mechanism relating obesity with sleep apnea is via the hormonal effects of adipose tissue.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Leptin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, has important effects on weight regulation by stimulating hypothalamic satiety centers (6, 34, 57).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Human obesity is typically associated with elevated leptin levels, suggesting a state of leptin resistance (15).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Besides regulating weight, leptin may have important effects on ventilatory drive.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Leptin-deficient mice hypoventilate and have a blunted response to hypercapnia (53, 84).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Administration of leptin corrects these abnormalities independent of changes in weight (53).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Through these effects on ventilatory control, elevated leptin levels (or the underlying leptin-resistant state) may play a pathogenic role in the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	21	It is also possible that OSA may play a causal role in the development of obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	22	 OSA patients have elevated leptin levels compared with weight-matched controls, and OSA treatment lowers these levels (39, 53, 55).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These findings suggest OSA may be a cause of leptin resistance and thus a propensity for further weight gain.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Not only does sleep disruption, a common result of OSA, reduce serum leptin levels, it also increases levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin (76, 82).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These findings were associated with increases in hunger and appetite scores (76).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Epidemiological studies consistently implicate reduced sleep as a risk factor for the development of obesity (36, 47, 70, 82, 87, 89).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although overall weight does not appear to fall with treatment of OSA, one study did find the amount of fat inside the abdominal cavity (visceral fat) diminishes (10).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This fat compartment appears to have unique hormonal effects as the amount of visceral adipose tissue is more strongly associated with metabolic complications of obesity such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than measures of subcutaneous fat or overall obesity (28, 29).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	29	Similarly, familial factors have been known to influence OSA risk for nearly 25 years (77).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Since then, several groups have quantified the familial risk of OSA by studying widely different populations.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	31	 All of these studies have identified a strong heritable component to OSA (30, 32, 49, 62, 66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Family-based studies suggest that the risk of OSA is approximately twice as great among relatives of apneic persons (30, 66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, a dose-response relationship exists such that the risk of OSA increases with increasing number of apneic relatives (66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Quantitative apnea-related phenotypes also demonstrate substantial heritability.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A study of elderly twins found the heritability of both the respiratory disturbance index and the oxygen desaturation index to be nearly 40% (7).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	36	Clearly, given the strong effect of obesity on OSA pathogenesis, any genetic variant that predisposes to obesity will secondarily also lead to the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Thus any obesity gene might also be considered to be an apnea gene.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, obesity is not a monolithic process.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Clearly, there are some forms of obesity that have a more important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For example, fat deposition in the neck is much more important than fat deposition in the limbs (17).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	41	 An android fat deposition pattern (excess subcutaneous truncal-abdominal fat) and visceral adiposity have also been found to more closely predict OSA than overall obesity (31, 72).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Therefore genetic polymorphisms that influence fat deposition in these sites will be more important OSA genes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	43	 There is a wealth of evidence that these fat distribution pattern phenotypes are genetically driven.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Large differences in the patterns of fat deposition exist across inbred strains of cattle, suggesting an important role for genetics (83).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Among humans, even after correction for overall obesity, measures of fat deposition pattern aggregate within families.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The ratio of subscapular skinfold thickness to subscapular plus suprailiac thicknesses, a measure of the android fat pattern, has been reported to have a heritability of 43% (71).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Measures of central obesity such as BMI-adjusted waist circumference and ratio of trunk to extremity skinfold ratio have heritabilities of 29 to 48% (40).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	48	 These findings strongly support the hypothesis that there are genetic polymorphisms that specifically promote fat deposition in the subcutaneous regions of the torso or around the abdominal viscera.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Through this mechanism, these variants would promote the development of both obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	50	Another type of potential genetic interaction between obesity and OSA is one in which a particular polymorphism leads to both obesity and OSA through independent mechanisms (Fig.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	51	 For example, by impacting leptin function, a genetic polymorphism may reduce satiety and also increase ventilatory instability.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This is what is referred to as genetic pleiotropy.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Pleiotropic genetic effects have clearly been described in other situations.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	54	 A well known example is at the APOE locus, which codes for apolipoprotein E.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The 4 allele of APOE is an important risk factor for both atherosclerotic heart disease as well as Alzheimer s dementia (24, 91).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The circadian regulatory gene, CLOCK, also appears to influence multiple biological systems.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	57	 CLOCK-knockout mice have profound disruptions in circadian rhythmicity, and so it is not surprising that these animals would have abnormal timings for feeding and activity (88).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In addition, however, these mutant animals demonstrate an overall increase in caloric intake associated with a phenotype of obesity and metabolic syndrome (85).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Similarly, given the large number of neurological, metabolic, and mechanical overlaps between obesity and OSA, it is likely that a polymorphism affecting one biochemical system may affect the risk for both disorders via multiple paths.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For example, disruptions of the orexin system could potentially result in a common link between obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus play an important role in sustaining wakefulness with projections to all of the wake-promoting areas of the brain (21).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Loss of these neurons is associated with a narcolepsy phenotype (60).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	63	 These neurons, as the name orexin implies, also play an important role in stimulating appetite, projecting on to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (68).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Thus mutations affecting orexin, the orexin receptor, or proteins involved in the downstream signaling of orexin binding might simultaneously affect metabolic and sleep-related function.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Several other potential candidate genes are listed in Table 1.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Both obesity and sleep apnea are heavily influenced by underlying genotype.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Some susceptibility genes act directly on one phenotype and through the causal relationships between obesity and sleep apnea have indirect effects on the other.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Other loci have pleiotropic effects, impacting susceptibility to both obesity and sleep apnea via independent mechanisms.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The results provide insight into possible genetic overlaps between obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Linkage to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as a measure of OSA and BMI as a measure of obesity was tested across the autosomal chromosomes in both a Caucasian and an African-American cohort.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The heritability of AHI in both groups was 33%, whereas the heritability of BMI was over 50%.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	75	 After controlling for BMI, significant heritability for AHI remained, supporting the notion that the genetic susceptibility to OSA is not completely defined by weight.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In further multivariate modeling of a larger subset of the Cleveland Family Study, obesity measures such as BMI and serum leptin explained 50 to 55% of the genetic variance in AHI (56).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This suggests that about half of the genetic determinants of AHI are obesity related and half are obesity independent.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	78	Linkage findings are described by the logarithmic odds (LOD) score, a measure of the odds ratio of linkage to no linkage.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Although none of the linkage findings in either racial group achieved genomewide significance (LOD  >  3.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	80	3) (46), there were several regions with intermediate LOD scores, indicative of possible linkage in the setting of complex, multifactorial diseases such as obesity and OSA (90).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Furthermore, the change in linkage evidence for AHI after adjustment for BMI provides insight into mechanisms of action if a susceptibility locus is present.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Among the Caucasians, a LOD score of 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	83	7 for BMI on chromosome 12p (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	84	 After adjustment for BMI, the maximal LOD for AHI in this region dropped to only 0.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	85	4 whereas the LOD for BMI adjusted for AHI fell to 0.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	86	 These data suggest that if a susceptibility gene for AHI exists in this region, it likely mediates its effect on apnea via obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	87	 On the other hand, a maximal LOD for AHI of 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	88	4 was found on 19q with no linkage evidence for BMI in this region (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Adjustment for BMI had no effect on the AHI LOD, suggesting that a susceptibility gene in this region exerts its effect on AHI through obesity-independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	90	A different pattern of linkage findings was found at the short arm of chromosome 2.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Among the Caucasians, the maximal LOD for AHI is 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	92	1 in this region, again suggesting that a susceptibility locus for both phenotypes might exist in this region (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, adjustment for BMI only dropped the LOD for AHI to 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	94	3, suggesting that the obesity effect at this locus does not fully explain the apnea effect.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This may represent two independent loci, one influencing AHI and one BMI.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Another possibility is that there is only one locus at 2p regulating both AHI and BMI but via independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A strong candidate gene for both phenotypes in this region is proopiomelanocortin (POMC).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	98	3, encodes for a number of hormones including melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	99	 POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are important in energy homeostasis via MSH.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Leptin s anorexic activity is mediated via depolarization of these neurons, and use of an MSH agonist decreases both body fat and leptin levels in humans (16, 25).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Obesity phenotypes have been consistently linked to the POMC locus (14, 33, 38, 67), haplotypes in this gene have been associated with leptin levels (38, 50), and severe mutations in this gene produce a severe childhood obesity phenotype (44).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Leptin s effects on ventilatory drive in mouse models are also mediated via MSH, suggesting that this pathway may independently predispose to apnea as well (64).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	103	Evidence for pleiotropy also exists at chromosome 8q.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Among African-Americans in the Cleveland Family Study, the peak LOD scores were 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	105	6 for AHI and BMI, respectively (55).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Again, after controlling for BMI, the AHI LOD only dropped to 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	107	1, suggesting that the obesity and apnea promoting effects in this region were independent.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	108	 A potential candidate locus in this region is the COH1 gene at 8q22 to 23.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This gene encodes a transmembrane protein with a presumed role in vesicle-mediated sorting and intracellular protein transport on the basis of its structure (43).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Severe mutations in this gene have been associated with Cohen syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by truncal obesity (9).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Other findings include facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and ocular anomalies.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The craniofacial abnormalities include microcephaly, facial hypotonia, and laryngomalacia, all of which could predispose to OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus mutations in this gene that are milder but more common may play a role, via separate pathways, in contributing to nonsyndromic forms of both obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	114	The serotoninergic system is another common pathway that could link obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Serotonin has important effects on the stimulation of satiety centers in the arcuate nucleus (5).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In addition, serotonin potentiates hypoglossal neural output, which increases upper airway dilator muscle activity (45, 75).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Thus reductions in serotoninergic activity, by increasing appetite, could promote obesity and, by lowering muscle tone in the upper airway, could promote OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Both linkage and haplotype association studies in a Finnish population suggest a serotonin-related gene at Xq24 is associated with obesity (51, 81).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The SLC6A14 gene encodes for a sodium chloride-dependent transporter of neutral and cationic amino acids, which appears to play an important role in the transport of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, into the central nervous system (73).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	120	 A French study has confirmed the association of this polymorphism with obesity, and an association with hunger and satiety scores was also found (19).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Whether this polymorphism is associated with OSA (via or independent of any obesity effects) has not yet been studied, as the OSA linkage scans reported thus far have not included the sex chromosomes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	122	View larger version (24K):    Fig.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Sleep apnea susceptibility genes may interact with obesity through numerous mechanisms to influence sleep apnea predisposition.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Genetic polymorphisms may modulate the degree to which obesity alters ventilatory drive, reduces lung volume, or narrows the upper airway.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Other polymorphisms may affect the degree to which these stresses result in the development of sleep apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Similarly, obesity susceptibility genes may interact with sleep apnea in its potential effect on obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	127	  The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPARG) gene located on chromosome 3p25 encodes a protein that is a key component of a nuclear transcription factor important in adipocyte differentiation (4).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Variants in this gene have been implicated as risk factors for the development of obesity (4, 18, 20, 48, 86).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Because hypoxia is known to suppress PPARG gene transcription (94, 95), the importance of a mild defect in PPARG function may become magnified in the setting of recurrent exposure to hypoxia from OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Thus PPARG allelic variants may play a much more important role in determining obesity phenotypes in individuals with OSA, and OSA may play a much more important role in promoting weight gain among those with a mutation in PPARG.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	131	Similarly, the effects of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and UCP2, two other obesity candidate genes, may be influenced by OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These genes encode for uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial proton channels that divert energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis (2).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In so doing, their activation increases energy consumption.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Polymorphisms in both genes have been associated with obesity phenotypes (8, 12, 22 to 23, 52).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Interestingly, sleep deprivation in rodent models has been shown to increase expression of both UCP1 and UCP2 (11, 41), suggesting the sleep disruption of OSA may influence expression of these genes and thus the relative importance of a variant at these loci in determining obesity risk.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	136	The use of dense single nucleotide polymorphism maps will allow for better resolution of linkage findings so as to narrow down candidate loci.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	137	 A better understanding of the neurobiology and molecular pathways underlying obesity and sleep apnea will also allow for a more rational selection of candidate genes to test for association with these disorders.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Ultimately, the use of gene-knockout animal models will be important to establish causality of any identified associations.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In performing these genetic studies, it will be important to simultaneously consider both disorders given their close relationship.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Methodology for conducting bivariate linkage scans has already been developed, and there is evidence to suggest that such a strategy is more powerful than traditional univariate approaches (1).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Not only will many genetic variants influence the development of OSA by causing obesity or vice versa but it is likely that there are also variants with pleiotropic effects predisposing to obesity and OSA via independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Identifying such genes and understanding their function will provide novel insights into the shared pathogenesis of these diseases.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Finally, the possibility that genetic polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility that each disease confers toward the other should not be ignored.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Incorporating such a model of gene x environment interaction into future study designs along with an understanding of the effects of obesity on OSA can allow for a better delineation of OSA susceptibility genes and vice versa.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Similarly, use of such a model along with information about the genetics of obesity would allow for a more complete understanding of how OSA may impact obesity.

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	4	STARVATION-INDUCED BIOCHEMICAL and metabolic changes are perceived by the hypothalamus, which in turn coordinates behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine responses to these stimuli (1).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Studies in rodents have shown that food deprivation induces marked ACTH and corticosterone responses, implicating feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (2, 3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Besides nutritional states and neuropeptides, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and neuropeptide Y (NPY), known to regulate both the HPA system and feeding behavior, several "signals" are known to regulate the HPA system.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Hypoglycemia is a potent activator of the HPA axis, reflecting the strong functional relationship between the hypothalamic feeding centers and the HPA axis (4), and leptin, whose concentrations are governed by nutritional status, has an inhibitory effect on plasma corticosterone in rats (5).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	8	More recently, orexin A (OR-A) and orexin B (OR-B), produced by neurons localized in the lateral and dorsal hypothalamic area and perifornical hypothalamus (6), have been implicated in the central regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis (7).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Both OR-A (a 33-residue peptide) and OR-B (a 28-residue peptide) are proteolytically cleaved from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, and share a 46% amino acid sequence homology.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Besides playing a role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis, orexins have been reported to exert divergent physiological actions (8 to 12).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Orexins orchestrate their actions by binding and activating two types of G protein-coupled receptors, orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptor (OX2R), which display 64% homology in their amino acid sequence (6).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The OX1R preferentially binds OR-A, whereas OX2R binds both OR-A and OR-B, apparently with similar affinity (6).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	13	In the hypothalamus, levels of prepro-orexin messenger RNA are regulated by several nutritional states and signals.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Fasting (6) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia (13, 14) increase prepro-orexin mRNA in the rat lateral hypothalamic area, whereas leptin has the converse effect (15).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Interestingly, fasting and leptin also regulate the hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These findings, and the observation that intracerebroventricular administration of OR-A or OR-B stimulates food consumption in rats (6), suggests a physiological role for these neuropeptides as mediators in the regulation of feeding, particularly in response to energy deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although the hypothalamus is considered the cornerstone for maintenance of energy homeostasis, the adrenal gland plays a role in the integration of metabolic activity and energy balance.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For example, studies in food-deprived rats have suggested that the HPA axis is integral to a larger hypothalamic system that mediates energy flow (2) and that, in these animals, catabolic activity quickly predominates, reinforced by elevated corticosterone not driven by hypothalamic control (ACTH), implicating adrenal activity as a metabolic regulator (3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition to their hypothalamic effects, "nutritional signals" such as leptin and NPY have a direct action at the adrenal level, via their receptors, including the modulation of corticosteroid secretion (17, 18).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Of interest, rat adrenals express both orexin receptors (19), and orexins stimulate corticosterone secretion of rat adrenocortical cells through the activation of the adenylyl cyclase-dependent signaling cascade (20).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	21	The expression of orexin receptors in both rat and human adrenals is well documented.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In the rat, both receptors are expressed in the adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Interestingly, the highest amount of OX2R mRNA was found in the adrenal gland of male rats, which was four times higher than brain OX2R mRNA levels (19).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In situ hybridization revealed that OX2R mRNA is localized primarily in the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis, whereas there was no expression at the adrenal medulla (19).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	25	In view of these findings and the observation that changes in orexin levels are closely related to nutritional status rather than to the state of hunger or satiety (21), we hypothesizsed that activation of orexin receptors at the adrenal level may explain the ACTH-independent rise in corticosterone seen in "starved" rats.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We sought to investigate, in both the hypothalamus and adrenal gland, 1) whether levels of orexins and their receptors OX1R and OX2R differ in fed and food-deprived rats, by assessing their expression at mRNA and protein level and 2) to elucidate whether nutritional status elicits functional changes of OX1R and OX2R, by studying G protein coupling and the subsequent activation of second messenger pathways.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	27	The University of Warwick, UK, ethics committee on use and care of animals approved all procedures described.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Adult male (initially 250 g) Wistar rats were housed in groups of two (n = 6 for each group) in environmentally controlled conditions (22  plus or minus  2 degrees C, humidity 40 to 60%) under a 12:12-h light-dark schedule (lights on 0600).

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	210	To determine which G proteins are coupled to the orexin receptors in the food-deprived and fed state, hypothalamic and adrenocortical membranes were labeled with GTP-AA in the presence or absence of OR-A followed by immunoprecipitation with specific G subunit antibodies (Gs, Gi, Gq, Go).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	211	Optimal labeling of G subunits with GTP-AA requires receptor activation of heterotrimeric G proteins with release of bound GDP.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The binding of GTP-AA is dependent on GDP concentration, GTP affinity of the G subunit, and agonist incubation time (26).

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	215	 OR-A-induced labeling with GTP-AA was time dependent, with an optimal incubation time of 3 min (data not shown).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Using the Gs subunit as a paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that the coupling of orexin receptors upon challenge with OR-A was dose dependent, with maximal activation at a concentration of 100 nM (Fig.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	217	The specificity of the immunoprecipitating properties of Gs antibody were assessed by comparing the migration positions of orexin-induced GTP-AA photoaffinity labeled G proteins with those ADP ribosylated using [32P]NAD with cholera toxin to demonstrate that the same protein band was radiolabeled and immunoprecipitated by the specific antibody.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Surprisingly, our photoaffinity [32P]GTP-AA experiment indicated that the orexin receptors in both hypothalamus and adrenal cortex preferentially activate the 45-kDa form of the Gs protein.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This observation requires further investigation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Treatment of hypothalamic membranes with OR-A (100 nM) revealed that orexin receptors coupled to multiple G proteins, including Go, Gi, and Gs and to a lesser extent Gq in the control group (Fig.

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Interestingly, in the food-deprived animal, OR-A decreased the coupling of orexin receptors to Gs and Go and increased that of Gi, whereas there was no coupling toward Gq (Fig.

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, in the food-deprived animals compared with controls, treatment of adrenocortical membranes with OR-A induced a modest response toward cAMP production that was significant only at 100 nM, with no apparent effect toward IP3 turnover (Fig.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Again, these findings were in keeping with our photoaffinity labeling experiments.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	258	The hypothalamus plays a major role in the regulation of food intake and energy balance by integrating multiple anorexigenic and orexigenic signals, including those elicited by orexins (21, 27).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	259	 A similar role for the adrenal gland is possible given that it expresses receptors for leptin, NPY (28), and orexin (19, 29), all regulators of energy homeostasis.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In agreement with previous studies (6, 15), we were able to show that the levels of prepro-orexin mRNA are influenced by nutritional status, being upregulated upon fasting in the hypothalamus.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Detailed analysis at the protein level confirmed that both cleaved bioactive peptides (OR-A and OR-B) are upregulated under food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Previous studies in fasted lactating rats demonstrated hypothalamic OR-B levels to be raised 10-fold above those for controls (nonfasted), whereas OR-A showed no change (30).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	263	 These differences can be due to the rodent strain used, the sex, metabolic status, and the duration of food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	264	Food deprivation leads to changes in the activity of the HPA axis within 3 h, with an increase in corticosterone (3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These findings are of interest given that orexins stimulate the HPA axis when administered centrally (31).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Furthermore, orexin neurons are sensitive to nutritional signals such as insulin and glucose, which alter with food deprivation (3), and hypothalamic orexin neurons express leptin receptors.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	267	 As with prepro-orexin expression, fasting and leptin also regulate hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16, 32).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	268	Numerous studies have mapped in detail the expression of orexin and orexin receptors at the hypothalamic level.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	269	 (33) have demonstrated that, within the hypothalamus, OX1R mRNA is most abundant in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, whereas OX2R is predominantly expressed in the paraventricular nucleus.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	270	 In another study, it has been shown that, after 20 h of fasting, levels of rat OX1R mRNA were significantly increased in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the medial division of amygdala, whereas levels of OX2R mRNA were augmented in the arcuate nucleus but remained unchanged in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and amygdala following fasting (16).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Three different studies (34, 13, 15) indicated that prepro-orexin is upregulated in the hypothalamus upon food deprivation in the lateral hypothalamic area of the rat.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In agreement with these studies, we noted that, on fasting, hypothalamic OX1R and OX2R gene expression was induced.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Given the detailed analysis these studies provided, we shifted our interest to the expression at the protein level.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Here, we provide new evidence that these changes are also mirrored at the protein level, as it was assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting analysis.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	275	Previous studies (3, 4) have shown that food deprivation switches feeding responses to adrenocortical responses and that the time of food presentation appears to be a more potent synchronizer of the phase of plasma corticosteroid levels than is the light-dark cycle (35).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	276	 These observations are of interest given that orexins have circadian-dependent actions and that orexins are known to increase corticosterone production in rats (20) and cortisol in human adrenocortical cells (36).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	277	 However, in view of our data, we can conclude that adrenal orexin receptors do not influence or mediate the rise in corticosterone levels seen under food deprivation conditions.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	278	It is well documented that food deprivation induces multiple metabolic changes that may directly influence orexin receptor expression in the adrenal gland.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	279	 For example, there is a negative correlation between testosterone levels and fasting (37).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Studies from our laboratory have shown that testosterone levels also decrease following 24 h of food deprivation (unpublished observations).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Interestingly, in gonadectomized rats, there was a significant downregulation of adrenal OX2R, an effect that was reversed upon testosterone replacement (38).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Although the regulation of adrenal orexin receptors by gonadal steroids is not directly relevant to our findings, it suggests that changes in orexin receptor expression may be a secondary phenomenon following initial food deprivation-induced alterations.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	283	Future studies should concentrate on elucidating the central and peripheral actions of orexins.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	284	 This can be done by systematically deleting OX1R and/or OX2R in a tissue-specific fashion using the Cre-loxP system.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	285	 By use of this approach, a model can be generated bearing neuronal or adrenal-specific deletions of orexin receptors.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	286	Our data indicate that orexin signaling may be enhanced in response to energy deficit sensed by the hypothalamus, possibly and predominantly via OX1R, but at the same time decreased in the adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Orexins act through two distinct G protein-coupled receptors, which can transduce intracellular signals by activating heterotrimeric G proteins.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It is likely that multiple second messenger systems are involved, as orexins have been shown to increase intracellular calcium influx (6, 39, 40, 41).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	289	 There is also the suggestion that OX2R is coupled to the inhibitory Gi protein (42).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	290	 We have shown for the first time that native orexin receptors in the hypothalamus can activate four types of G proteins, namely Gs, Gq, Go, and Gi, in response to OR-A.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Although Gi and Go are the two major inhibitory signaling pathways in the rat brain, we have previously shown that multiple subtypes of G proteins couple to other G protein-coupled receptor systems (43).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Food deprivation altered the G protein coupling profile.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Our findings are supported by functional assays of cAMP and IP3 assays, reflecting their G protein coupling status.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Further research is needed to investigate whether the -subunits are implicated in activating second messengers and also to assess the effects of OR-B on G protein signaling.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	295	Although we have demonstrated functional orexin receptors in human fetal and adult adrenal glands (23, 44), this is the first report of G proteins coupling to orexin receptors in the rat adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Interestingly, we note a downregulation of all G protein(s), apart from Gi, in response to OR-A upon food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Second messenger studies confirmed these findings with minimal response toward cAMP production and none of IP3 in the adrenal cortex of the food-deprived rat.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Our findings support the observations that, in rat adrenocortical cells, OR-A stimulates corticosterone release via a cAMP pathway (20).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	299	Despite demonstrating for first time that rat orexin receptors can couple differentially to several G protein -subunits and activate multiple second messengers, caution should be exercised as to how to interpret these changes.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Given the plethora of different cell types that reside within the hypothalamus and the adrenal gland, no distinctions can be made between specific subpopulations from brain regions or adrenal zones from our data.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Here, we provide evidence about the signaling characteristics of orexin receptors under food deprivation in total hypothalamic and adrenal preparations.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	302	In conclusion, our study indicates that nutritional changes like food deprivation can exert differential effects on orexin receptor expression and their signaling characteristics at the hypothalamic and adrenocortical levels.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the significance of our novel findings, in particular the differential expression of G protein activation upon food deprivation, in both the hypothalamus and the adrenal cortex needs further elucidation.

0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This mystery results from the controversies related to the existence of a unitary anaesthetic target site.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	5	 From direct observation of clinical anaesthesia, this seems unlikely as different anaesthetic agents produce different  types  of anaesthesia.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	6	 GABAA receptors have long been held as a unifying cellular target (with some exceptions), but others have also been suggested.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this editorial, we consider the evidence in support of a role for noradrenergic transmission as a  wiring  target for anaesthetic action.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The clear role of this system in analgesia is not considered.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	9	Norepinephrine is a major central nervous system neurotransmitter in the brainstem.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Noradrenergic neurones are of great importance in the regulation of a range of behaviours including the sleep to wake cycle, feeding, thermoregulation, attention, motor activity, and growth and development.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	11	1 In addition, there are many studies suggesting that noradrenergic system(s) may be involved in the production of the  anaesthetic state .
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In the brain, the A1, A2, A5, and A7 noradrenergic clusters constituting the lateral tegmental area, project to the thalamus and hypothalamus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	13	2 The locus coeruleus (A6 cluster), which is distinct from the lateral tegmental area, innervates the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	14	The activity of locus coeruleus neurones is slow and regular during wakefulness.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	15	3 In contrast, when an animal becomes drowsy, entering slow wave and then REM sleep, there is a decrease in discharge rate such that during REM sleep these neurones are silent.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	16	3 Interestingly, all noradrenergic projections to the cerebrocortex originate from the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	17	The preoptic area receives input from both the locus coeruleus (A6), and the lateral tegmental group (A1, A2, A5, and A7) noradrenergic neurones.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	18	 4 In addition, neurones in the preoptic area project back to the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	19	5 This area plays an important role in sleep or hypnosis.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	20	 What is the role of noradrenergic neurones in this area? Most of the previous studies6 suggest that norepinephrine neurones in the preoptic area may contribute to wakefulness, as direct activation or injection of norepinephrine into this area inhibits sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, several studies also suggest that some norepinephrine neurones may be involved in the induction of sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	22	7 8 Mohan Kumar and colleagues7 reported that microinjection of norepinephrine into the medial preoptic area after destruction of the ventral noradrenergic bundle induced sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This group also reported that there was a mild reduction in sleep and an increase in wakefulness after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	24	8 Thus, it appears that noradrenergic fibres in the medial preoptic area may be hypnogenic.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	25	Central noradrenergic neurones are regulated by both - and ss-adrenergic receptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	26	 It has been reported that the 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, given orally, increased active waking and slow wave sleep and decreased paradoxical sleep in the rat.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	27	9 In contrast, 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with systemic methoxamine, increased aroused wakefulness and decreased slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep in cats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	28	10 In addition, prazosin increased but the 1-agonist ST 587 decreased the duration of thiopental anaesthesia in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	29	11 Matsumoto and colleagues also reported that direct intracerebroventricular administration of methoxamine dose-dependently reduced pentobarbital anaesthesia time in mice.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	30	12 Most of the central physiological effects of 2-agonists can be attributed to 2-adrenoceptors present in the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	31	13 In rats, microinjection of the 2-agonist dexmedetomedine into the locus coeruleus per se produces anaesthesia (defined as a loss of righting reflex).
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	32	14 2-Agonists also reduce anaesthetic requirement in human and many other species.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	33	15 In contrast to these data, the 2-antagonist yohimbine decreases sleep,16 and anaesthesia time15 in a variety of non-human species.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	34	The Angel group showed that propranolol, a non-selective ss-antagonist, dose-dependently increased sleep time16 and thiopental anaesthesia time11 in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, they failed to show an effect with the selective ss1-antagonists metoprolol and atenolol.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	36	11 17 They also studied the role of ss2-adrenoceptors in sleep and general anaesthesia,11 16 17 and found that the selective ss2-antagonist ICI 118551 increased sleep time16 and the duration of thiopental anaesthesia.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	37	17 Collectively, these data indicate that the effects of the non-selective antagonist, propranolol, may be mediated via ss2-adrenoceptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	38	The recently identified (from rat hypothalamus) neuropeptides orexin A and B18 are endogenous agonists for the G-protein-coupled orexin-1 (OX1) and OX2 receptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	39	18 Orexin A has equal affinity for OX1 and OX2, while orexin B has a higher affinity for OX2.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Orexins and their receptors are widely distributed in the brain.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	41	18 Orexins activate the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system and this activation may increase arousal and locomotor activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	42	19 In addition, several reports20 suggest a link between orexin receptors and narcolepsy.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Therefore, modulation of noradrenergic neurones by orexins and their receptors may contribute to control of the sleep to wake cycle.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Moreover, we suggest that these neuropeptides and their receptors may also be involved in general anaesthesia, although this remains to be examined.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	45	Based on these considerations, we and others have began a systematic evaluation of a range of anaesthetic agents on central norepinephrine release using in vivo microdialysis techniques.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Mizuno and colleagues reported that intraperitoneal pentobarbital inhibited norepinephrine release from the medial preoptic area in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	47	4 In addition, we have shown that systemic administration of midazolam and propofol significantly reduced norepinephrine release from the medial prefrontal cortex,21 but pentobarbital was ineffective.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	48	22 As noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex receive innervation from the locus coeruleus,3 the activity of noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex indirectly reflects locus coeruleus activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, anaesthetics that activate or enhance GABAA receptors may reduce noradrenergic neuronal activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In contrast, ketamine,21 22 nitrous oxide and xenon,23 which have NMDA receptor antagonistic actions, markedly increased norepinephrine release from the prefrontal cortex and preoptic area in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Clearly, anaesthetic modulation of norepinephrine release depends on the type of anaesthetic.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This might argue against noradrenergic transmission as an anaesthetic target.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, as we have already mentioned, a unitary site is highly unlikely.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Loss of consciousness results not only from a reduction in cerebral activity, but also as a result of cerebral excitation such as occurs during convulsions.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In addition, sleepiness is induced by not only hypothermia but also by increased body temperature that activates heat-sensitive neurones in the preoptic area.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	56	24 We feel that wakefulness may occur over a set range and that when this range is exceeded (above or below), unconsciousness may occur.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In support of this hypothesis we found that physostigmine, which has been reported to antagonize ketamine anaesthesia, reduced both the duration of ketamine anaesthesia and ketamine-increased norepinephrine release from the rat prefrontal cortex.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	58	Collectively, the data presented in this editorial provide compelling evidence in favour of a role for noradrenergic transmission in both the control of wakefulness and the production of the  mysterious  anaesthetic state.

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Hypothalamic neurons are part of this controlling system and play an important role in the regulation of breathing rate and depth (14, 26).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	7	Neurons in the lateral hypothalamus synthesize orexin A and orexin B, also called hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1) and hypocretin-2 (hcrt-2).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These peptide neurotransmitters are processed from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, encoded by a gene localized to human chromosome 17q2.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Orexin-containing neurons affect autonomic, neuroendocrine, and sleep-wakefulness neuroregulatory systems that in turn could potentially influence breathing (9, 13, 16, 19).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	10	The orexins stimulate target cells via two orexin G protein-coupled receptors, orexin R1 and orexin R2 (40).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It has been proposed that orexin-containing neurons promote wakefulness by excitation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which release acetylcholine and thereby contribute to the cortical activation of wakefulness.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, the causality of these associations remains to be determined because wakefulness is often accompanied by behavioral activation.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Suppression of rapid eye movement sleep occurs through an inhibition of the cholinergic neurons in the laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine nuclei (49).

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	157	The results of this study showed for the first time that a discrete population of orexin-ir neurons in the lateral hypothalamus projects to the ventrolateral medulla and phrenic nuclei.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These findings extend previous reports demonstrating that long descending orexin-containing axonal projections innervate the spinal cord (13, 24).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	159	 However, our results suggest that direct synaptic contact between pre-Botzinger neurons and orexin-ir neurons are infrequent, despite the presence of numerous orexin-containing fibers in this region.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	160	Conceivably, the apparent projection of a subset of lateral hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons to pre-Botzinger neurons and to phrenic nuclei could be partly due to nonspecific labeling produced by some diffusion of retrograde tracer into the regions that contain nonrespiratory-related cells, and/or the uptake of tracer by descending fibers of orexin neurons that innervate the intermediate cell column or the thoracolumbar portion of the spinal cord (24).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In addition, CTB may also be taken up by fibers of passage.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, CTB continues to be regarded as a useful retrograde tracer in even the most recent neuroanatomic studies (11).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Furthermore, our results are in accord with other reports of transsynaptic transport of pseudorabies virus from the diaphragm to the lateral hypothalamus (18, 21, 27).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	164	Considerable numbers of orexin containing fibers were present within the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This finding is in accordance with recent data that orexin-containing neurons innervate vagal preganglionic cells within the nucleus ambiguus (12).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, we found little retrograde transport of CTB infused into this area to hypothalamic orexin-ir neurons, and CTB-labeled cells were mostly located medial to orexin-ir neurons.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Because CTB is taken up by synaptic vesicles, the possibility exists that synapses between pre-Botzinger complex neurons and orexinergic fibers of passage may be sparse.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	168	 It may be that orexin released from passing fibers nonsynaptically activates receptors or that orexin circulating within cerebrospinal fluid may activate neurons that contain orexin receptors (volume transmission), in analogy with the effects of endogenously released catecholamines in this region (2, 23).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Medullary neurons ventral to the compact portion of the nucleus ambiguus, which in our study also were immunoreactive for orexin A receptors, may belong to the external (loose) portion of the nucleus ambiguus.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Such vagal preganglionic neurons may contribute to the control of respiration by the pre-Botzinger complex or else may not be directly involved in the control of respiratory timing.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A diversity of function of orexin-sensitive neurons in the medulla may explain the stimulatory effects of orexin on respiratory amplitude and the apparent lack of an effect on respiratory timing.

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	173	The results of the present study showed that neurons within a rostral ventrolateral medullary region corresponding to the pre-Botzinger complex did stain positively for orexin-A receptors.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This finding is in accord with numerous other studies of orexin receptors found throughout the brain stem and in more rostral brain regions (6, 7, 15, 19, 28, 46).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Furthermore, these findings for the first time indicate that identified phrenic motor neurons express orexin receptors.

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	177	Orexin microinjected into the pre-Botzinger region or administered topically to the cervical spinal cord increased DEMG, without affecting discharge frequency in bilaterally vagotomized rats.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	178	 An increase in peak integrated moving average activity of the diaphragm without changes in respiratory timing indicates that these neurons are involved in the regulation of tidal volume activity of inspiratory pumping muscles, independent of frequency discharge.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, these results do not exclude a critical role of inspiratory rhythm-generating cells of the pre-Botzinger complex for the control of respiratory timing (17).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	180	Orexin may also affect respiration via projections to other sites, e.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	181	, it may cause an increase in respiratory drive via activation of hypothalamic neurons that project to the pre-Botzinger complex and to phrenic nuclei (14, 26, 29, 41, 50).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Furthermore, the activity of upper airway dilating muscles such as the genioglossus muscle could be affected via direct projections of orexin-containing neurons to hypoglossal motoneurons and activation of orexin-1 receptors expressed by hypoglossal motor cells that innervate that muscle (48).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In addition, dense orexinergic projections innervate the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord where the majority of sympathetic preganglionic neuronal cell bodies reside (13, 46).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This indicates that lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons may act directly on different brain stem and spinal cord cell groups, providing parallel control to cardiovascular and respiratory related output neurons during behavioral state control, defensive responses, and energy homeostasis (22, 42).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	185	Orexin, when topically applied to the spinal cord, had slight but significant effects on heart rate.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These findings are in accord with other data showing that intracisternal or intrathecal injections of orexin A or B provoke a dose-related increase in heart rate and sympathetic neuronal activity in urethane anesthetized rats.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Orexin given by these routes could activate multiple central nervous system and spinal orexin-sensitive sites, including excitatory brain stem neurons and spinal cord sympathetic preganglionic neurons (3, 10).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	188	 We observed no effects of medullary infusions of orexin on heart rate, possibly because our rats were vagotomized (12).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	189	The physiological effects observed in this study showed a reliable dose-response curve but were obtained by using relatively high concentrations of orexin.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Possibly, some of these responses could in part be pharmacological.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	191	 A blockade of these results by pretreatment with an orexin antagonist (e.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	192	, SB-334867) would be required to completely eliminate the possibility that they could partly be non-orexin receptor mediated (5).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	193	Physiological Relevance of These Findings.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	194	Orexin neurons provide a link between central nervous system mechanisms that coordinate sleep-wakefulness states and central nervous system control of autonomic functions, via multiple projections (38).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	195	 These neurons also, as shown by the present study, are involved in regulation of the breathing activity, via projections to the brain stem-spinal cord respiratory related network, presumably through the orexin R1 signaling pathway.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	196	 This is in accord with a recent report that stimulation of the perifornical (lateral) hypothalamus elicits increases in respiratory activity, a response diminished in mice genetically engineered to lack orexin (25).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	197	 If, in humans, orexin proves to stimulate respiration, then a deficit in orexin action may contribute to a decrease in respiratory drive during sleeping (for review, see Ref.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This assumption is consistent with recent findings indicating that orexin plays an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness (for reviews, see Refs.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	199	A decreased influence of orexin in brain regions that regulate sleep and breathing could cause simultaneous decreases in both arousal and respiratory drive.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Recently, it was reported that patients with sleep apnea had decreased blood levels of orexin, relative to controls (34).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The mechanisms that could produce a decreased production of orexin are unknown but may be related to the apparent link between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It is well known that obesity is the most prominent risk factor for sleep apnea (30, 56).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia also appear to provoke sleep apnea (47).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	204	 It seems likely that some metabolic alterations provoked by obesity, possibly elevations in circulating nutrient molecules, could partly explain the association between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	205	In genetic and diet-induced obesity in rodents, blood concentrations of a number of circulating molecules are elevated.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	206	 An increased effect of glucose, free-fatty acids, or leptin on hypothalamic function could provoke an altered activity of orexin-containing neurons (1, 4, 8, 20, 35, 36, 39, 51, 52, 54, 55).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus orexin-containing neurons may be a key component in the connection between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Further study will be required to investigate this hypothesis.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	209	In summary, hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons are part of a brain stem-spinal cord respiratory-related network.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Orexin, acting via orexin R1 expressed by pre-Botzinger neurons and the phrenic nuclei, increases respiratory drive.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This indicates that the orexin-orexin R1 pathway may play an important role in linking central nervous system nuclei involved in regulation of sleep-wakefulness states with the central nervous system control of respiration.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Alterations in this regulatory system could lead to autonomic dysfunctions and sleep-related respiratory disorders.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	4	Five single-gene mutations that result in an obese phenotype have been identified in mice, one of which is the fat mutation.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The fat mutation is a single nucleotide change in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) gene resulting in a 202Ser to Pro change in the CPE protein in fat mice (22).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The CPE gene (Cpe) encodes an enzyme responsible for the processing of hormones, such as insulin and proopiomelanocortin.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	7	 CPE is present at high concentrations in secretory granules of the pancreatic islets and is required for the excision of residual dibasic residues remaining at the carboxy-terminal end of propeptides after processing by the endolytic prohormone convertases PCSK1 and PCSK2 (10).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The mutation in Cpefat renders the enzyme unstable, and it is ultimately degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The reduction in CPE activity in turn leads to a decrease of biologically active hormones such as insulin.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	10	 CPE defects have also been observed in other tissues, including the hypothalamus, which suggests that a number of additional prohormones may be implicated in the obesity phenotype such as neuropeptides, melanin-stimulating hormone (3), or melanin-concentrating hormone (25).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	11	The fat mutation initially arose on the inbred HRS/J (HRS) strain (7).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	12	 HRS-fat/fat mice exhibit early chronic hyperinsulinemia followed by mature onset obesity without hyperglycemia.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	13	 When the fat mutation was transferred to the C57BLKS/J (BKS) background, male mice harboring the mutation in a homozygous state became hyperglycemic after the sixth backcross generation (N6).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, BKS-fat/fat mice exhibit elevated plasma triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	15	 As the background strain difference with respect to diabetes development demonstrates, Cpefat is necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of diabesity (obesity/diabetes) in the Cpefat model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Other susceptibility loci must interact with fat to produce the hyperglycemia and other metabolic phenotypes observed in BKS-fat/fat mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To dissect the susceptibility loci interacting with Cpefat, we performed a genetic analysis of male mice homozygous for the Cpefat mutation from a large (BKS x HRShr/+ or +/+) F1 Cpefat/+ intercross [the inbred HRS strain also carries a mutation in the hairless gene (hr)].
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For temporal phenotypes such as body weight and plasma glucose, we constructed sets of derived phenotypes to capture key aspects of longitudinal measurements such as rate, flux, and severity of each phenotype.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Subcutaneous (rostral and caudal), retroperitoneal, and epididymal fat pads were isolated and weighed at termination.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Total fat pad weights were defined as the sum of the fat pads described here.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Adiposity indexes were calculated by dividing the total fat pad weight by carcass weight and multiplying by 100.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition to fat pad weights, body lengths (nose to tail) and girths of all animals were measured.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	36	 DNA was isolated from tail tissue by using proteinase K digestion and salt precipitation (28).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Because Cpefat and hr were segregating in the F2 intercross progeny, DNAs were PCR amplified with allele-specific primers to determine the genotypes at both loci.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	47	 To identify polymorphic regions between the BKS and HRS strains across the genome, DNA from parental BKS-fat/fat N6, BKS-fat/fat N10, and HRS-+/+ mice was typed for single stranded length polymorphism (SSLP) markers (Research Genetics) using PCR assays as previously described (14).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Initially, a total of 87 SSLP markers at an average spacing of 20 cM was tested for the genome scan, with the largest gap being 47 cM between markers D1Mit26 and D1Mit17 (marker information available upon request).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Additional markers were tested for chromosomal regions showing significant linkage.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	50	 At this resolution, we detected (1/87 markers tested in the scan) a region on chromosome 17 that differed between BKS-fat/fat N6 and N10 animals.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	51	 N6 animals were all HRS genotype at D17Mit142, whereas N10 animals were segregating with HRS and BKS alleles.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Because these areas and other HRS contaminated regions may exist [up to 2% of the genome (2)], a BKS-modifying QTL may have been missed.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Of the 2,838 F2 mice generated from the intercross, DNA from 282 fat/fat F2 male progeny was PCR amplified.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The phenotypic profiles of the F2 progeny were obtained using one-way ANOVA.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In examining the longitudinal data of the male F2-fat/fat mice, we noted different patterns of disease progression.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	62	 For example, some mice became hyperglycemic early and sustained their hyperglycemia, others were transiently hyperglycemic, and others showed a slow but moderate rise in plasma glucose levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	63	 To address the longitudinal nature of our phenotypes, we created derived phenotypes for body weight and plasma glucose.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This allowed us to obtain results that have a clear biological interpretation, i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	65	, to detect modifiers that act early or late in the disease process (change), that affect the rate of disease progression (curvature), that affect disease severity (final), or that remain constitutively expressed throughout the time course (average).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This also makes our results comparable with future studies that may measure body weight progression at different time points or even at irregular time intervals.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	67	 We constructed the following sets of derived phenotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Let bi be the log body weight at week i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Let gi be the log plasma glucose level of the mouse at week i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Termination age, the time at which necropsies are performed, differed between cohorts (24 or 30 wk of age).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We statistically examined whether there was a difference in mean values between necropsies done at 24 versus 30 wk.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The adiposity indexes measured at 24 and 30 wk of age were not significantly different (P = 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Therefore, in our genome scan analysis, we combined adiposity data for all cohorts to increase the power to detect linkage.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	74	 To adjust for this, we included an additive effect for cohort in our analyses of adiposity.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	78	 A one-dimensional genome scan, also commonly referred to as a genome scan, is a survey of all single-locus models explaining the phenotype.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	79	 This amounts to performing an ANOVA at every locus when complete genotype information is available.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We examine how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every locus and summarize the statistical evidence that a locus affects the phenotype by the LOD score.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	81	 A two-dimensional genome scan is a survey of all two-locus models explaining the phenotype.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Here, we examined how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every pair of loci in the genome.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	83	 For both one-dimensional and two-dimensional scans, we included an additive cohort effect for the three cohorts of mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This method of analysis is able to combine the overall evidence in favor of a locus in all three cohorts while respecting their differences.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The rationale for the combining of crosses has been previously reported and used in other studies (1, 8, 17, 31).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Genotypes from chromosome 8 (linked to the fat mutation) and distal chromosome 17 (cohort I and II animals) were all HRS genotype and hence excluded from the genome analysis.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	87	 After the genome scans, a two-stage model selection procedure was followed.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Locus and locus pair selection have been previously described (29).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	89	 All loci that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional scans were selected.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	90	 We selected locus pairs as follows.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	91	 All pairs that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold in the two-dimensional scan for the full two-locus model were subjected to secondary tests.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To determine whether both loci in a pair were acting additively, we compared the two-locus additive model to both single locus models dropping each locus in turn.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	93	 For the comparison, we used a nominal P value of 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	94	 This corresponds approximately to the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional genome scan.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We then tested the interaction component of the two-locus model using a nominal P value of 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This corresponds to a 5% permutation test threshold for the interaction test only.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Backward elimination has been previously described (5).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	98	 All loci and locus pairs selected in the previous stage were put together in a multiple-QTL model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The additive cohort effect was always included in the multiple-QTL model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The multiple-QTL model was formed by selecting the marker closest to the locus.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	101	 If there were genotypes missing at the markers, the multiple-imputation method (26) was used to account for the missing genotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The basic idea is that the missing genotypes can be probabilistically inferred from the genotypes of nearby markers.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This is done by simulating the missing genotype at the marker conditional on the flanking typed markers.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	104	 To account for the uncertainty in our knowledge of the true genotypes, a number of imputations (26) were used.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Each term in the model (including the cohort effect) was dropped, and the change in the LOD score was noted.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	106	 (This corresponds to a type III ANOVA.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	107	) If the nominal P value of the change in the LOD score was  > 0.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This procedure was continued until no term could be dropped.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	111	To test whether the major QTLs were specific to the fat/fat animals, we performed an ANOVA test on the fat/fat and non-fat/fat male progeny.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Because plasma glucose was not measured at 20 wk in non-fat/fat mice, we redefined the average glucose measurement for all animals as the average of the plasma glucose levels at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 wk (for this test only).

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	164	 To determine the effects of hr on various traits in F2 intercross progeny, fat/fat, fat/+, and +/+ mice were genotyped with allele-specific primers for the hr mutation, and mean values for all traits were compared (Table 5).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In all three genetic subgroups, mice homozygous for the hr mutation had significantly reduced body weight measurements, which suggests that bwt1 is acting independently of fat on body weight.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The fact that no significant interaction was detected with find1 was surprising because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become diabetic.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Because hr is segregated in the crosses, we hypothesized that the find1 effect on plasma glucose may be dependent on the hr genotype on chromosome 14.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become hyperglycemic, this implies that find1 is interacting with additional loci from the BKS background.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Our multiple-QTL model did not detect a locus interacting with find1; however, we did observe an association between plasma glucose levels of mice homozygous (HH) at find1 and their genotype near the hr locus on chromosome 14.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	200	 This suggests that the hr gene (or a closely linked gene) may have an effect on find1 expression.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In addition, loci closely linked to the Cpe locus on chromosome 8 cannot be ruled out, because all mice analyzed were homozygous Cpefat.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Diabetes susceptibility loci have been found in the same interval as find1 on distal mouse chromosome 19 in several rodent experiments (11, 12, 16, 27).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Whether all of these loci are due to mutations in the same gene remains to be determined.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	204	A major QTL for body weight (bwt1) was identified on chromosome 14.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The LOD peak of bwt1 is in close vicinity to hr, making hr a plausible candidate.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Allele typing of the hr allele in the F2 progeny showed that hr/hr mutant mice had significantly lower mean body weight values than haired (+/+) mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Hairless HRS mice (HRS-hr/hr mice) also have lower mean adipose depot and body weights than their normally haired albino (HRS-+/+) littermates (20).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	208	 It has previously been shown that hairless mice have a higher metabolic rate than normally haired albino mice (9).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This was attributed to greater energy requirement for thermoregulation in mice lacking body hair.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	210	 However, it was recently discovered that the hr gene product acts as a corepressor to the thyroid hormone receptor (24), and the hr mutation might, therefore, mimic some of the effects of thyroid hormone on energy metabolism.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Altogether, our data suggest that hr is responsible for the lowered body weight in HRS-hr/hr mice and that the hr gene itself explains some of the variance observed in F2 fat/fat males and acts independently of the fat locus.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	212	 There are currently no published reports on adiposity in human patients with congenital alopecia or artrichia carrying mutations in the Hr gene, so that it is unclear whether hr mutations have the same effect on metabolism in humans as in mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	213	A major locus (fina1) on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with adiposity in the genome scan of the F2 fat/fat mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The fact that fina1 was not observed in lean controls implies that the fina1 locus is epistatically interacting with fat, thereby, masking the effects of hr on adipose depot distribution in F2 fat/fat mutant mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The interval for fina1 is still fairly large but includes intriguing candidates such as Hcrt and Cpd.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Although no sequence variations were observed in the coding regions of both genes, the possibility of promoter defects needs further exploration.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	217	In this study, we carried out a genetic analysis of the complex phenotype caused by the prohormone processing defect in fat mutant mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We use a novel method of analyzing modifier genes involved in different patterns of disease progression such as rate, fluctuation, and severity.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We also show that many of the phenotypes observed in fat mice can be ameliorated by the action of major modifier genes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Because obesity is often associated with alterations in neuropeptide levels, the identification of these diabesity-associated modifier QTL should also lead to a better understanding of the biological pathways and neuropeptides that may be involved in common forms of obesity.

0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	10	Although ghrelin is predominantly produced in endocrine cells of the stomach (17, 18), it is also synthesized in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (1, 19), a critical region for feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The ghrelin receptor, however, is extensively distributed throughout the brain to areas such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and arcuate nucleus (20, 21).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both areas contain several subsets of neurons that produce neuropeptides implicated in feeding regulation, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, proopiomelanocortin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and orexins (orexin-A and orexin-B), which are also termed hypocretins (22, 23).

0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	138	Ghrelin receptor mRNA is also present in the LH of rats (21), a region implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Animals with LH lesions exhibit decreased food intake (36, 37), whereas electrical stimulation of the LH during a satiated state promotes feeding (37, 38).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Orexin and MCH are orexigenic neuropeptides synthesized specifically in the LH (22, 25, 26, 27, 32, 39, 40).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Ghrelin fibers project to the LH to synapse on orexin-immunoreactive neurons.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Icv administration of ghrelin induced Fos expression in orexin-expressing neurons but not in MCH-expressing neurons; this result is consistent with a recent finding that icv administration of GHRP-6, a synthetic GH-releasing hexapeptide that binds to the ghrelin receptor (41), induced Fos in a similar neuronal pattern (9).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These findings indicate that ghrelin may stimulate feeding through both the orexin system and the NPY and AgRP systems.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	144	Several peptidergic and monoaminergic systems that participate in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus link through neuronal circuits.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	145	 NPY fibers directly project to orexin neurons (42, 43); icv injection of anti-orexin antiserum before NPY injection significantly attenuated NPY-induced feeding (44), indicating that NPY interacts with orexin both anatomically and functionally.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	146	 As ghrelin induces feeding through activation of the NPY system, we sought to investigate the activation of orexin-producing neurons by ghrelin via the NPY system.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	147	 We therefore examined ghrelin-induced Fos expression in orexin-producing neurons following pretreatment with anti-NPY IgG.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Ghrelin remained competent to induce Fos expression in orexin-producing neurons following pretreatment with anti-NPY IgG, suggesting that ghrelin activates orexin-producing neurons in a manner independent of NPY.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	149	Orexin regulates not only feeding and energy homeostasis but also sleep-wakefulness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic functions (25, 29, 40, 45, 46).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Ghrelin induced Fos expression in approximately 23% of orexin-immunoreactive neurons.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	151	 As 33% of orexin-immunoreactive neurons are glucosensitive (47) and a subset of these neurons express the receptor for leptin (42), a satiation signal produced in the adipocytes, a part of orexin-expressing neurons may play a crucial role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	152	To investigate the functional relationship of ghrelin with either the orexins or MCH, we examined the effect of anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs or anti-MCH IgG pretreatment on ghrelin-induced feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Food intake induced by ghrelin was attenuated by anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs, but not anti-MCH IgG pretreatment.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition, ghrelin-induced food intake in mice deficient in orexin was significantly lower than that seen in wild-type littermates.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	155	 These data suggest that centrally administered ghrelin increases food intake through the action of the orexin system.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	156	 To date, six functional NPY receptors (Y1 to Y6) have been identified (48, 49).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	157	 NPY stimulates feeding predominantly through Y1 NPY receptor (33, 50).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Icv injection of an Y1 NPY receptor antagonist significantly reduced ghrelin-induced food intake.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Moreover, coadministration of ghrelin and Y1 NPY receptor antagonist following anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs pretreatment abolished ghrelin-induced feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Therefore, ghrelin likely interacts with both the NPY and orexin systems to induce feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	161	Feeding behavior involves the complicated integration of a large number of learning, memory, cognitive, emotional, somatosensorimotor, and autonomic events.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Icv administration of ghrelin strongly induces Fos in the hypothalamus, brain stem, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and piriform cortex (7).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Centrally administered ghrelin may regulate feeding and energy homeostasis not only through direct activation of orexin and NPY pathways but also through influences on learning and memory, a state of mood, and formation of emotion.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Further investigation of ghrelin interactions with other neuronal systems will provide novel insights into the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Treatment of obesity has proven difficult, and this intractability may be due to the fact that energy balance is regulated through multiple and complex mechanisms that are not fully understood (4).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Maintenance of body weight is achieved by an intricate balance between energy intake and expenditure.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We found that changes in nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) mediate resistance to weight gain with overfeeding in sedentary adults (32).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	9	 There is evidence that "spontaneous" physical activity (SPA) is familial (63) and shows marked interindividual differences in its contribution to daily energy expenditure (49); however, the mediator of the interaction between overfeeding and physical activity is unknown.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	10	Orexins (A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2) are recently identified neuropeptides synthesized exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus, an area classically believed to be a crucial "feeding" center (25).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Initial interest in these neuropeptides concentrated on their orexigenic actions, since central injection of orexins increased food intake, and prepro-orexin mRNA was shown to be upregulated with fasting (50).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Apart from appetite regulation, orexins have been implicated in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of arousal and sleep, cardiovascular function, temperature, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, pituitary secretion, glucose homeostasis, and gastric acid secretion (17, 37, 48, 51, 53, 58).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	13	 (12) reported that, following intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A, hypothalamic c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was highly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and orexin A injected directly into the PVN stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These authors suggested that the PVN might not be the primary site of action of the orexins in their orexigenic role; rather, the orexins might perform some other role via the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The PVN is demonstrated to be one of the sites innervated by orexin-containing neurons (39, 44) and to express orexin receptor 2 (36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	16	These observations intrigued us, and we wondered whether spontaneous physical activity (SPA) is not random but rather intricately regulated in the CNS.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, we would propose that the interaction between overfeeding and physical activity undergoes processing within the hypothalamus due to its role in energy homeostasis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	18	In this study, we address the hypothesis that orexin A acts on the PVN to increase SPA independently of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Our approach was to inject orexin A into the PVN and measure SPA, thermogenesis, and feeding behavior by use of arrays of infrared activity sensors, indirect calorimetry, and infrared 24-h videotaping.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Additionally, we observed effects of the orexin receptor antagonist (selective for orexin 1 receptor, OX1R) SB-334867 injected into the PVN.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	53	O2 consumption and CO2 production were measured using a customized, high-precision, single-chamber indirect calorimeter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) as we have reported previously (29, 33).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thermogenesis was calculated from O2 consumption and CO2 production.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Calibration of the calorimeter was performed before each measurement.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Decreases in SPA followed the antagonist injection, and it partially blocked the effect of orexin A on both SPA and thermogenesis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	175	 SB-334867 has a 50-fold higher affinity for the OX1R than for the OX2R (11).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In the rat brain, differential expression of OX1R and OX2R has been reported, and OX2R was predominantly expressed in the PVN (36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	177	 OX1R is considered to be a selective receptor for orexin A, and OX2R is considered to be a nonselective receptor for both orexin A and orexin B.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Despite lower affinity at OX2R, high concentration of SB-334867 at the site, the PVN, might attenuate the effect of orexin A via block of OX2R; however, because it was also reported that intraperitoneal injection of this compound attenuated orexin A-evoked grooming (11), selective OX2R antagonist is needed to verify the role of the receptor subtype in the effect of orexin A at the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	179	Our data are consistent with other observations regarding the neurohumoral role of orexin A.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Central orexin systems may be critical regulators of sleep/wake states based on neuroanatomic and genetic data (7, 8, 13, 34, 41, 44).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Specifically, orexin A may activate arousal centers (17).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Our observations that PVN-injected orexin A induces SPA are compatible with the fact that orexin A acts to maintain the waking state (47).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The behaviors that we observed in response to orexin A injection were consistent with wakefulness, namely, intense grooming, face-washing behavior, and rearing and searching activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Several reports also describe an immediate increase in grooming, face-washing activity, and locomotor activity after intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A (17, 21, 22, 24, 38).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Additionally, there are reports showing the relationship between endogenous orexin and locomotor activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	186	 (27) showed that orexin A release into cerebrospinal fluid was higher during active waking than in quiet waking in cats.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	187	 (15) reported that Fos expression in orexin neurons correlated with locomotor activity in rats.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	188	 (18) showed that genetic ablation of orexin neurons in mice resulted in a decrease in spontaneous motor activity and that these transgenic mice became obese despite hypophagia.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	189	 These reports also strongly suggest that orexin plays a role in regulation of SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	190	Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is suggested to be involved in orexin A-induced behaviors (21), because it is known that grooming behavior is closely associated with environmental stress (16), and intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A increases plasma corticosterone (17, 31) and adreno-corticotropin levels (23, 52).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Intracerebroventricular administration of CRF increased grooming behavior (30) and intracerebroventricular administration of -helical CRF, a CRF antagonist, blocked the orexin-induced behaviors, specifically grooming and face washing (22).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In terms of brain concentration, CRF is synthesized mainly in the PVN (55), and this peptide is also thought to be integral to energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The PVN is one of the sites densely innervated by orexin-containing neurons and expresses OX2R (8, 36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Thus our results are consistent with the thesis that orexin A stimulates these specific behaviors via CRF.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The dopaminergic system is also suggested to mediate the orexin A-induced activity and grooming behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Involvement of the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic system in intraventricularly administered orexin-induced hyperactivity in rats has been demonstrated (38).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Further study is needed to determine the downstream pathways of orexin A-induced hyperactivity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	198	It is known that orexin A injected into the PVN induces feeding.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, our data demonstrate that PVN-injected orexin A induced feeding behavior only when it was injected early in the light cycle when feeding behavior was minimal in control animals.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	200	 There was no relation between the magnitude of orexin A-induced SPA and duration of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In other words, PVN-injected orexin A can increase SPA without induction of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This elevation in activity without concomitant feeding behavior is consistent with our previous studies examining the effect of orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus, another brain site integral to energy homeostasis (20).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The early-light cycle feeding induced by PVN-injected orexin A in this study is in agreement with data from others indicating that orexin A injected into the ventricles and into the lateral hypothalamus stimulates feeding only during the light cycle (20, 67).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The reason why stimulation of feeding after orexin A injection occurs only during the light cycle remains unclear.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	205	 It has been demonstrated that for orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus there is a twofold greater feeding response to orexin A in food-restricted rats, which have a high level and rate of feeding (60).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thus level and/or rate of feeding are unlikely to be related to the lack of feeding after orexin during the dark cycle.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	207	 (14) reported that orexin A-induced (icv administration) feeding was largely circadian dependent and that orexin A-induced increase in grooming was moderately circadian dependent.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These authors suggested the possibility that the increase in feeding appeared to largely reflect the wake-increase actions.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Other reports regarding orexin A injection into the PVN have shown variable results (10, 12, 56).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	210	 (12) reported that PVN-injected orexin A (0.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	211	3 nmol) stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	212	 (10) showed that 1 nmol of orexin A injected into the PVN stimulated food intake, but they reported no other behavioral effects than feeding and drinking.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Differences in dose of orexin A (0.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	214	03-1 nmol, injected under light cycle in all reports) and the generally moderate effect of orexin A on feeding may explain the discrepant results in feeding response between these three reports.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In the present study, we injected 1 nmol of orexin A and observed increased feeding when it was injected in the early light cycle, and we also observed remarkably increased physical activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This observation contrasts somewhat with that of Dube et al.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	217	; however, they did not examine SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We recorded animals' behavior by using videotaped recording and quantified their activity by using arrays of infrared activity sensors.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Our results suggest that orexin A in the PVN acts predominantly to increase nonfeeding physical activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	220	Levels of SPA in humans cluster in families (63) and for mice within strains (5).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These observations suggest that identifiable genetic components may exist to account for variance in NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Additionally, we observed NEAT to increase with positive energy balance (32).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Recently, decreased plasma orexin A levels in obese individuals was demonstrated (2).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Because orexin A can pass the blood-brain barrier (26), peripheral orexin A levels might reflect its CNS levels.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In the mouse hypothalamus, age-related decline in OX2R messenger RNA levels has been shown (59), and it is known that old rats have decreased activity (43).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The decline in orexin with obesity and aging may support the hypothesis that orexin A in the PVN is a mediator of NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Lubkin and Stricker-Krongrad (35) reported that intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A resulted in an increase in metabolic rate that was not dependent on an increase in activity in mice.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We measured O2 consumption and CO2 production by indirect calorimetry.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Increased O2 consumption accompanied increased activity and the thermogenic response to orexin A, which clearly tracks the orexin A effect on SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Thus we consider the increase in O2 consumption and thermogenesis to be a result of the increase in SPA associated with orexin A.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The reason for this contrast may be due to differences in injection site between studies; site-specific injections reach a much more limited receptor population than ventricular injections.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	232	 With a ventricular injection, it is unknown where injectate ultimately and predominantly reaches; thus effects observed could result from stimulation of receptors at multiple locations.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	233	Unlike neuropeptide Y, a potent orexigenic and hypothermic signal with a clearly defined pattern in energy balance states, orexin A activity in energy balance states appears to be more complicated.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Some studies show no difference in orexin A activity after fasting, (3, 45, 65), whereas others show elevated orexin expression or activity after fasting (50, 66, 69).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Orexin A activity during states of positive energy balance has not been thoroughly tested.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	236	 One study showed that high-fat feeding increased gene expression of orexin A (64), which is consistent with our hypothesis of increased orexin activity with positive energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, studies of obese animal models show either decreases in orexin A expression or activity (6, 54, 68) or no change (57, 61).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	238	 These conflicting data likely represent the complicated role of orexin A in energy balance: although orexin administration stimulates feeding, it also elevates activity, perhaps predominantly, which enhances thermogenesis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Therefore, one cannot simply place orexin A in the class of obesity-promoting neuropeptides on the basis of its feeding-stimulatory properties.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This is clearly illustrated by the data from Hara et al.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	241	 (18), who demonstrated that loss of orexin A activity resulted in an obese animal model.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Although these animals ate less, they were also much less active.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The obese state of the animals in this study indicates that the decreased energy expenditure brought about by the loss of orexin A function was clearly more potent than the hypophagia in affecting energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, although the present data and those of others (18, 64) indicate that positive energy balance may stimulate orexin A, further studies examining endogenous orexin A activity in lean and obese animal models during overfeeding paradigms will help to determine what role orexin A plays in modulating NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	245	In summary, injection of orexin A into the PVN dramatically increases SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The increase in SPA for 2 h occurs regardless of the time of injection.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The effect of orexin A on SPA appears to be predominantly through an increase in general activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	248	 However, we concur with others that orexin A via the PVN also stimulates feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Orexin A therefore appears to be a neurohumoral mediator of SPA, NEAT, and feeding.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Its role in the physiology of energy balance requires further investigation.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	4	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a major role in energy expenditure and thermogenesis via the function of uncoupling protein 1.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The regulation of energy expenditure in BAT is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system and higher brain structures.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Discrete hypothalamic nuclei and various orexigenic or anorexigenic neuropeptides regulate BAT metabolism by affecting efferent sympathetic nerve activity (8, 9, 10, 11).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Hypothalamic neuronal histamine, an anorexigenic substance, increases BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Orexins affect energy balance and thermoregulation.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Orexin A has been shown to induce hypothermia and food intake, and both orexins increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (13, 14, 15, 16).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Therefore, it is highly probable that orexins regulate BAT energy expenditure and thermogenesis by influencing sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We thus hypothesized that hypothalamic neuronal histamine may mediate orexin signals to the sympathetic nerves that innervate BAT, because the close relationship between these two systems has been recognized both anatomically and functionally (17, 18).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This study therefore examined the effects of central administration of orexins on electrophysiological sympathetic nerve activity in BAT and modulation of these responses by neuronal histamine.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A stainless steel wire stylet (29 gauge) was left in place in the guide cannula to maintain patency and prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	29	 After determination of the background firing rate of the sympathetic nerves, changes in nerve activity were measured for up to 60 min after each bolus i3vt infusion with orexin A (0 to 3 nmol/rat, 1.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	92	The actions of orexins are mediated via two G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R and OX2R (1, 2).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The receptor binding affinity of orexin A is 10 to 100 times greater than orexin B for OX1R, whereas both orexins are equipotent for OX2R (2, 23, 24, 25).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Distinct expression patterns of the two receptor subtypes have been identified throughout the brain (5).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Considering the i3vt infusion site used in this study, the target site for the binding of orexin to receptors may be either the hypothalamus or the brain stem.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	96	 From this standpoint, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the A5 cell group, and the LC, all of which express high levels of OX1R mRNA, may be candidates as targets of orexin A, because these nuclei have been identified as central origins of efferent pathways to the BAT and to each other (26).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	97	On the other hand, high-density expression of OX2R has been observed in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the LHA, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the ventral premammillary nucleus, and the TMN, and moderate expression levels have been found in the medial preoptic area and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (5).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The PVN and medial preoptic area were identified as major hypothalamic origins of efferent pathways to BAT in a neuroanatomical study (26).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In fact, chemical stimulation of these nuclei increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	100	 From the ARC, the LHA (especially orexin neurons themselves), and the PVN, direct neuronal projections to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord, a location of sympathetic preganglionic neurons, have been identified (27, 28).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Among these nuclei, cumulative evidence indicates the importance of the LHA and the ARC in orexin-A-OX2R signaling to suppress BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated an excitatory effect of orexin A on LHA neuronal activity and an inhibitory influence of this area on BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8), indicating that the LHA is a target site of orexin A for regulation of the sympathetic innervation of BAT.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	103	In contrast to the suppressive effects of orexin A, central administration of orexin B in the present study increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In addition, this orexin B-induced response was attenuated by histamine depletion caused by pretreatment with FMH.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	105	 As described above, the presence of orexin neurons, as well as the orexin receptor OXR2, has been identified in the TMN, a site of origin for histamine neurons (29).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	106	 It has been demonstrated that neuronal histamine mediates orexin signaling in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle (30).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Finally, central administration of histamine has been shown to increase BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Taken together, the evidence suggests that it is highly probable that orexin B regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity in an excitatory manner through OX2R in the TMN.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Our unpublished observation demonstrated that FMH treatment, but not neuropeptide Y antagonist, influenced orexin B-induced feeding and/or sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The results suggested that neuronal histamine, but not neuropeptide Y, might be closely involved in the orexin B-induced feeding behavior and sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Further study is necessary to clarify the details of this mechanism.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	112	Considering both the present and previous studies, the results suggest that OXR in hypothalamus or the brain stem may mediate the orexin-induced effect on BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In addition, modulation of OXR in the outside of the hypothalamus, such as cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and the cisterna magna, is also possible.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Previous studies demonstrated that orexin could have direct effects at the level of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons (31).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Beyond BAT sympathetic nerve activity, further studies that examine the sympathetic nerve activity of renal and lumber nerves may be merited.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	116	Functional studies have recently demonstrated that central administration of orexin A or orexin B induces hypothermia or hyperthermia, respectively (14, 15).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	117	 These results are consistent with the present study, because the time course of BAT thermogenesis, as assessed by local BAT temperature, was similar to that observed for BAT sympathetic nerve activity (32).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	118	 On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated an orexin A-induced hyperthermic response in unanesthetized animals (33, 34).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is well known that arousal state and muscle movement affect body temperature; in the unanesthetized condition, administration of orexin A induced an increase in arousal level and consequent arbitrary movements, both of which may elevate body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	120	 There was the possibility that anesthesia might modulate BAT sympathetic nerve activity and thermogenesis because anesthesia is a factor, but not the sole mechanism, regulating arousal state and body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Because the present study was limited to the acute phase of orexins  effects in anesthetized rats, it is possible that differences in the state of arousal may determine the effect of orexins on body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In addition, the timing of infusion might influence the orexin-induced sympathetic nerve activity because the effects of orexins are clearly dependent on the sleep-wake cycle (30).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	123	In summary, we demonstrated that central administration of orexins induces dual effects on BAT sympathetic nerve activity: inhibition by orexin A and stimulation by orexin B.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Hypothalamic neuronal histamine is involved in the latter response of BAT sympathetic nerve activity.

0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	4	In a novel and important set of clinical studies reported in this issue of JCEM, Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	5	 (1) examined long- and short-sleepers, who sleep greater than 9 h or less than 6 h per night, respectively.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Assessing melatonin and cortisol levels and monitoring body temperature, they found a longer "biological night" in long-sleepers than in short-sleepers, which is characterized by a greater duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion and later early morning temperature nadirs and cortisol peaks (1).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus, physiological processes that mark the output of the circadian timing system parallel sleep duration.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	8	The findings of Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	9	 (1) give credence to everyday observations that sleep needs vary individually and suggest that the amount of sleep we need reflects intrinsic factors.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These observations also underlie why it is difficult to change sleep patterns, if we are fighting inherent physiology.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	11	The notion that one s sleep duration is intrinsically determined has widespread implications in many disciplines, including industry, healthcare, and education.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	12	 "Sleep debt" caused by sleep deprivation is a recognized cause of industrial accidents and impaired worker productivity (2).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For example, roadway accidents are more common in sleep-deprived truck drivers (3).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The productivity of air traffic controllers is adversely affected by shift work, as well (4).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	15	The excessive work hours of medical house officers, who work through the night when "on-call," has raised concern about patient safety.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Understandably, this issue has caught the scrutiny of legislators and regulatory agencies (5).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These efforts have resulted in new policies that limit work hours by medical staff.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	18	Not only are we curtailing the sleep of adults in the name of productivity, the educational system is cutting into the sleep of children and adolescents.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In many educational districts, the school day begins in early morning hours (6).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It is not uncommon to see children standing on street corners awaiting the school buses in early morning darkness.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Reflecting the fact that it is difficult to advance the hands on one s biological clock irrespective of age, adverse effects from reduced sleep and early morning awakening on academic performance are being increasingly recognized in children and adolescents (6).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	22	We live in a society in which we can control our photic environment through the simple flip of a switch or the more convenient clap of the hands.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Using alarm clocks and planned schedules, we believe that we can override our natural sleep needs.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We believe that we can comfortably live our lives out of synchrony with the 24-h light-dark cycle, and reverse our days and nights without penalty.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, as reflected by the ever-increasing number of businesses devoted to optimizing schedules of shift workers, it is difficult to willfully change sleep habits and the hands of the circadian clock.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	26	It was thought that by exposing shift workers to bright light at night, the circadian clock could be reset.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Yet, unless stringent efforts are made to limit daytime lighting exposure, resetting of the biological clock will not occur, and melatonin and cortisol rhythms may remain out of phase with periods of sleep and wakefulness (7).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Individuals working at night may, thus, be out of phase with their optimal periods of alertness and task performance.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Efforts to develop agents to reset the circadian clock (i.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	30	 "jet lag drugs") have also been largely unrealized (8).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Despite the popular hype that melatonin can conveniently shift circadian phase, data to support this notion are not striking and show modest effects at best (9, 10).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	32	Just as it is difficult to change one s circadian phase, the observations of Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	33	 (1) provide a basis for why it is difficult to change sleep habits.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Because the duration of the biological night varies individually, it may be more difficult for some individuals to adapt to condensed sleep schedules than others.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Strategies and guidelines aimed at improving health and productivity of shift workers may, therefore, be effective for some individuals, but ineffective for others.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	36	The biological basis of variability in sleep duration is unknown at present and remains an intriguing issue.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	37	 An evolving body of evidence suggests that the sleep cycle and circadian rhythmicity are integrally related, with the circadian system influencing both the timing and duration of sleep.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Expressed circadian rhythms, like the sleep-wake cycle and rhythms in hormone production, are generated and regulated by a biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Damage to these nuclei results in episodes of sleep and wakefulness occurring throughout the 24-h day, rather than being consolidated at night.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	40	 SCN damage also results in an increase in the total duration of sleep in primates (12).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	41	Over the past decade, the dissection of the molecular hands of the circadian clock has lead to fascinating new insights.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The generation of circadian rhythms seems to be related to the complex interaction of a handful of transcriptional regulators and kinases, resulting in 24-h cycles of protein expression and action in the SCN (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In mammals these factors include the proteins PERIOD, CLOCK, CRY, BMAL, and casein kinase 1 (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Mutations in some of these factors have been discovered recently.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	45	In humans, mutations in PERIOD-2 are associated with the advanced circadian phase syndrome (13).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Individuals with this condition wake very early in the morning and retire to bed at early evening hours.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In animals, mutations in CLOCK result in abnormal, disorganized sleep problems (14).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Mutations in casein kinase 1 result in a short circadian day (period) (15).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	49	Whereas it is possible to localize the circadian clock in mammals to a discrete region in the brain, the brain regions involved in sleep organization are far more diffuse, involving complex subcortical networks (16).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Similar to how clock-gene mutations are providing insights into the biological basis of circadian rhythmicity, the discovery of novel proteins has also provided insights in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders (17, 18, 19).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The inability to produce or respond to orexin/hypocretin has been found to be a cause of narcolepsy (17), and it is likely that this seminal discovery will lead to new diagnostic tests and treatment for this disorder (17).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	52	By coupling our knowledge of basic clock and sleep mechanisms with powerful genetic approaches that permit the identification of specific genes in small cohorts, it is likely that there will be further identification and elucidation of factors that regulate the duration and timing of sleep (18).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The continued characterization of individual variation in sleep and the identification of families and cohorts with unusual sleep and circadian properties will also greatly enhance genetic approaches in this regard.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, we may someday learn why some individuals have the ability to stay up and watch David Letterman after the 11 o clock news, whereas others retire before the news at 10 o clock.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	55	Society, industry, and medicine are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of sleep and the proper timing of sleep cycles, as reflected by sleep- and work-hour-related laws.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, compared with the advances in our understanding of basic sleep and circadian physiology and molecular biology, public attention in this arena has lagged considerably.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	57	 We can readily manipulate our photic environment, yet we stubbornly recognize how difficult it is to overcome "mother nature" and change the timing of and the amount of sleep we need.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Increasingly, we seem to value our alarm clocks more than our internal clocks.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Thus, an important challenge of our modern and fluid society is to be able to accommodate our normal circadian cycle and our individual sleep requirements in the name of progress and productivity.

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	4	In female rats, pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA levels were increased 12-fold after ovariectomy compared with sham- operated rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The increase of pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA was inhibited by treatment with 17ss-estradiol.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Adrenal mRNA levels of OX2 receptors in ovariectomized rats were increased 2-fold compared with sham-operated rats and were also reduced by treatment with 17ss-estradiol.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In male rats, orchidectomy increased the mRNA levels of pituitary OX1 receptors compared with sham-operated rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In contrast, adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA was reduced after orchidectomy.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Testosterone treatment reversed the effect of orchidectomy on pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the hypothalamus, no differences were found in the mRNA levels of prepro-orexin, OX1, and OX2 receptors between sham-operated, placebo-treated, and steroid-treated female or male rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	11	Our results indicate that gonadal steroids differentially regulate pituitary OX1 receptors and adrenal OX2 receptors in male and female rats and may contribute to specific sex- dependent neuroendocrine and endocrine actions of orexins.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	12	Two subtypes of orexin receptors, namely OX1 and OX2 receptors, were cloned (1).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Their expression patterns in the rat brain are in good agreement with the widespread projections of orexin immunoreactive neurons (17, 18).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Within the hypothalamus, OX1 receptor mRNA was detected in areas like the medial preoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus, whereas OX2 receptor mRNA was found in regions such as the paraventricular and the arcuate nucleus (18).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Therefore, the effects of intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected orexins on plasma hormones such as ACTH, prolactin, LH, and GH (13, 14, 15, 16) may be mediated by affecting the synthesis and/or liberation of releasing hormones.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition, orexins may directly influence pituitary hormones because orexinergic nerve fibers are present in the median eminence and pituitary gland and orexin receptors were detected in the pituitary gland (4, 19, 20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Indeed, orexins were shown to stimulate CRH and GnRH release from the hypothalamus (21) but also to inhibit releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH and LH release from the pituitary (22, 23).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The inhibitory action of orexin on GnRH-stimulated pituitary LH release was observed only in proestrous female rats and not in male rats (22).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Moreover, in female rats the effect of icv-injected orexins was dependent on the status of ovarian steroids (16).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, whereas in ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with 17ss-estradiol (E2) and progesterone icv orexin increased plasma LH levels, in untreated OVX rats orexin decreased plasma LH levels (16).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	21	 One explanation for this bimodal action of orexins on LH release is a possible regulation of orexin receptors by estrogens.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Interestingly, we have recently detected a sexually dimorphic expression of peripheral orexin receptors with higher mRNA levels of OX1 receptors in the pituitary and of OX2 receptors in adrenal glands of male rats when compared with female rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	23	To clarify the effect of gonadal steroids on the orexin system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of prepro-orexin as well as OX1 and OX2 receptors in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands of sham-operated and gonadectomized male and female rats and the influence of subsequent E2 or T treatment using quantitative real-time PCR.

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	116	In addition to their effects on energy homeostasis, there is considerable evidence that orexins can regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (16, 22, 32, 33, 34).

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This bimodal response appears, in part, to be mediated by GnRH because orexin stimulates GnRH release from hypothalamic explants of male and proestrous female rats (21, 22).

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, because orexin receptors are also present in the pituitary gland, a direct effect of orexins can be assumed.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In ovarian steroid-treated rats, the stimulatory effect of icv orexins on pituitary LH release was observed already at low doses, whereas a high dose of orexin was necessary to suppress the release of LH in the absence of ovarian steroids (16, 32).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	122	 It could be possible that orexins, when injected icv at high doses, reach the pituitary gland by diffusion into the portal circulation and stimulate pituitary OX1 receptors, which are up-regulated in the absence of ovarian steroids as shown by our results.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Although, there was no significant effect of orexin on basal LH release from dispersed pituitary cells, orexin inhibited GnRH-induced release of LH from isolated pituitary cells in proestrous female rats (22).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus, orexins may differentially regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis by exerting contrary effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These estrogen-dependent bimodal actions of orexins on LH release in female rats may be caused by the up-regulation of OX1 receptors at low E2 levels.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Such a receptor-dependent regulation of hormone-release is well established for other peptides such as angiotensin II (37, 38).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	127	In addition to the effect on GnRH-induced LH release, other direct actions of orexin on the pituitary gland are possible.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Although no effects of orexins on basal ACTH were observed in male and female rats, Samson and Taylor (23) reported an inhibitory effect of orexins on CRH-stimulated ACTH release in vitro.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This finding is supported by the localization of orexin receptors in human corticotrope pituitary cells (30).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Interestingly, the ACTH response to stress depends on gonadal steroids in both male and female rats (39, 40).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The role of orexins in these responses remains unclear.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	132	 However, our findings of a strong regulation of pituitary OX1 receptors by E2 and, to a lesser degree, by T, imply a so far undefined hormonal regulation of orexin actions in the pituitary gland of male and female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	133	In the adrenal gland, we found very high mRNA levels of OX2 receptors in accordance with our previous findings which also showed much higher amounts of OX2 receptor mRNA in male rats compared with female rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Interestingly, gonadal hormones differentially affected the mRNA levels of adrenal OX2 receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	135	 E2 reduced the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors, whereas T increased the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Therefore, both E2 in female rats and T in male rats may contribute to the observed sex differences in adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA expression.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Inconsistent data exist regarding the localization of adrenal orexin receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In rats, OX1 and OX2 receptor like immunoreactivity was found in the adrenal medulla but not in the cortex (28).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In contrast, quantitative PCR showed much higher levels of OX2 receptor mRNA, which was selectively localized in the adrenal cortex of the rat by in situ hybridization (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	140	 These results are supported by findings of Randeva et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	141	 (31), who found OX2 receptors but not OX1 receptors selectively in the cortex of human adrenals using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunostaining.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Others, however, have described OX1 receptors in the cortex and OX2 receptors in the medulla of the human adrenal (41).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Because orexins stimulate adrenal glucocorticoid release in rats and humans (42, 43) and glucocorticoids play an unique role in energy homeostasis, it is intriguing to speculate that in male rats orexins may regulate glucose metabolism via regulation of glucocorticoids.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Interestingly, we found increased levels of plasma orexin A by T in male rats in contrast to female rats where plasma orexin A levels were unchanged by E2.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Further experiments are needed to clarify possible T-dependent functions of the adrenal orexin system.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	146	Thus far, it is unclear whether, in rats, adrenal OX2 receptors are stimulated by circulating orexins or whether orexins are locally produced in the adrenal gland as described by Randeva et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The presence of orexin in plasma has been described before in rats and humans and circulating orexins may activate adrenal orexin receptors (20, 44).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Although the source of plasma orexins is currently uncertain, orexin-producing neurons project to the median eminence and may therefore contribute to plasma orexins (29).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	149	In contrast to the lower mRNA levels of orexin receptors in the pituitary and adrenal glands of female rats compared with male rats, prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor mRNA levels are elevated in the hypothalamus of female rats (20, 27).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In our present study, we could not reveal changes of hypothalamic prepro-orexin or orexin receptor mRNA after gonadectomy or hormonal treatment in male and female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Our results in female rats are in accordance with findings of Russell et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	152	 (22), showing no effect of estrogens on hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA in female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In addition, in male sheep, E2 did not affect prepro-orexin mRNA levels (45).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Thus, other factors may be responsible for the observed differences between male and female rats, and it may be concluded that the central (hypothalamic) expression of prepro-orexin and orexin receptors is not under the control of ovarian steroids.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, because orexin receptor subtypes are distinctively expressed in hypothalamic nuclei (18) discrete changes of orexin receptor mRNA levels in specific hypothalamic nuclei might not be detectable by analyzing whole hypothalamic extracts using RT-PCR and cannot completely ruled out by our results.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	156	Estrogens and T have divergent effects on food intake, energy expenditure, and body weight and plasma levels of estrogens correlate positively, whereas plasma levels of T correlate negatively with body fat mass (46).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Our findings of weight gain after ovariectomy is in accordance with previous observations (47).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The reduced weight in female rats after E2 replacement may be attributed to the somewhat higher plasma E2 levels in E2-treated female rats in comparison to sham-operated female rats (47).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	159	 (48) showed that OVX could influence body weight independently of food intake and separately from central mechanisms.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In our study, the regulation of orexin receptors by gonadal steroids appears to be limited to peripheral organs.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Thus, the peripheral orexin system and particularly adrenal OX2 receptors may contribute to sex specific regulations of energy homeostasis.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	162	In summary, our results show that E2 and T differentially regulate the mRNA expression of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors in female and male rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Thus, in addition to the ability of orexins to regulate the reproductive system, sex steroids may affect the actions of orexins.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Like other peptides regulating energy homeostasis and reproductive functions (49) orexins may play an important role in coordinating these systems but may also sex dependently influence other orexin-related functions like the autonomic system and sleeping behavior.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	8	The most studied animal model of HD is the R6/2 mouse, which expresses exon 1 of the human mutant HD gene with 150 CAG repeats (9).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In advanced stages, these mice display several clinical features reminiscent of HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These include impaired motor coordination, tremor, changes in open field behavior, progressive weight loss and increased incidence of epileptic seizures (10).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For unclear reasons, they die prematurely at the age of 12 to 15 weeks.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Their brains exhibit a high frequency of intraneuronal nuclear inclusions of the polyglutamine-containing protein.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	13	 So far, relatively little cell death, with only few scattered neurons undergoing  dark degeneration , has been described (11,12).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	14	Neuropathological studies of end-stage HD patients have demonstrated up to 90% neuronal loss in the tuber nucleus of the lateral hypothalamus (7,8).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In humans, this region is particularly enriched in NMDA receptors (13).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This implicates the involvement of excitotoxic cell death, which has repeatedly been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of HD in other brain regions (1,14).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Interestingly, a recent study showed that in slice cultures of rat lateral hypothalamus, neurons containing the peptide orexin (also known as hypocretin) are particularly susceptible to excitotoxic damage (15).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Orexin A and B are synthesized from the same precursor gene and are expressed in the same neurons with their cell bodies concentrated to the lateral hypothalamus (16,17).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These neurons project widely throughout the central nervous system with particular dense projections to monoaminergic centers.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	20	 They are thought to interact with autonomic, neuroendocrine and arousal systems through excitatory effects of orexin (reviewed in 18).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Importantly, studies in mice with a null mutation of the gene for orexin (19) or one of its receptors (20) as well as transgenic mice with a targeted ablation of orexin neurons (21) revealed severe disturbances of sleep and wakefulness, similar to narcoleptic symptoms in humans (22).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Subsequent studies have shown that most human narcolepsy patients have reduced levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (23) and that, in some cases, the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus is reduced (24).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Taken together, these findings strongly implicate the orexin system in sleep regulation.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	24	Here we describe, for the first time, a progressive loss of orexin neurons, with ultrastructural signs of neurodegeneration, in the lateral hypothalamus of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Importantly, we have also observed a significant reduction in the number of orexin-positive neurons as well as a significant atrophy of the remaining orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of HD patients.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We also report a significant reduction of orexin levels in R6/2 mouse CSF, which suggests that measuring CSF levels of orexin in HD patients could be a novel means to assess disease progression and the potential effect of novel therapies.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Two of the animals also exhibited abrupt and sudden changes of posture, and interestingly, all three mice displayed what we interpreted as narcoleptic episodes with complete falls onto the side (4 to 5 falls per mouse, group median=4) (Fig.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	76	 These episodes were followed by sudden bouts of locomotion, which typically were hyperactive compared with those in wild-type control mice.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	78	 We also evaluated the behavior of 12-week-old R6/2 mice during daytime, which mice normally largely spend sleeping.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Interestingly, during the light phase of their diurnal cycle, R6/2 mice generally spent less time sleeping than wild-type mice, but they exhibited repeated, sudden episodes of behavioral arrest, sometimes associated with an abrupt change of posture.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Those episodes were never seen in wild-type littermate controls (data not shown).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	81	As R6/2 mice are known to be seizure-prone (9), we subjected a different group of 12.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Our video-EEG recordings revealed no epileptiform electrographic activity during this type of episodes of motor arrest.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Rather, the EEG was characterized by small amplitude theta activity and reduced EMG signal of the neck muscles (Fig.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The average number of orexin-positive neurons per square millimeter in the section showing the highest density of orexin-positive neurons for each subject is given in Table 2.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In control brains from healthy individuals, the average number of orexin-positive neurons per square millimeter was estimated to 62 plus or minus 4 neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In corresponding areas in brains from HD affected individuals (grade II to IV), the average number of orexin-positive neurons was 45 plus or minus 1/mm2 (Student's t-test, P < 0.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	91	 There was also a significant neuronal atrophy detected as a reduction in the average cross-sectional surface area of the orexin cell bodies in HD patients (230 plus or minus 33  microm2) compared with controls (363 plus or minus 8  microm2) (Student's t-test, P < 0.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The illustration shows both atrophy of the individual neurons and a reduction in orexin-immunopositive neurons in the HD patient brain compared with the control brain.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	95	What are the connections between the narcoleptic-like episodes and the loss of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus in R6/2 mice? Deficits in orexin neurotransmission are known to result in behavior reminiscent of narcolepsy in mice and dogs (19 to 21,29).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Interestingly, the frequency, duration and general appearance of the narcoleptic episodes seen in R6/2 mice are very similar to those observed in genetically modified mice lacking orexin or carrying mutant orexin receptors (19 to 21).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Furthermore, there is a correlation between the progressive loss of orexin neurons and the gradual onset of the narcoleptic phenotype in R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Taken together, the striking motor arrests in R6/2 mice are likely a direct consequence of the observed loss of orexin neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	99	Why is there a loss of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons in HD and the R6/2 mouse model? Clearly, they are sensitive to the expression of an expanded polyglutamine protein, as mouse and rat models expressing an ataxin-3 construct with an increased number of CAG repeats, under the control of the orexin promoter, exhibited adult onset degeneration of the hypothalamic orexin neurons (21,30).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Possibly, the expanded polyglutamine stretches disturb functions of crucial interacting proteins.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Thus, huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP-1), a partner for huntingtin with unknown function, is enriched in the hypothalamus and null mutant mice for HAP-1 die early owing to impaired feeding and exhibit hypothalamic degeneration (31).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In the same study, a transgenic mouse model expressing the first 171 amino acids of huntingtin with 82 glutamines (N171 to 82Q mice) also showed HAP-1 depletion and degeneration of neurons in the hypothalamus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Although the transmitter identity of the dying neurons in these models was not established, the degenerative phenomena included the lateral hypothalamus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Another explanation for the selective vulnerability of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons may be related to their expression of NMDA receptors.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Recently, it was shown that exposure of rat hypothalamic cultures to excitotoxicity resulted in a specific loss of orexin neurons (15).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Excitotoxicity has been widely regarded as a likely contributor to cell death in HD (1,14).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	107	 There is evidence for functional changes in glutamatergic pathways in the R6/2 mice at several levels: from release, transmitter inactivation and receptor composition, to intracellular signaling in neurons receiving glutamatergic input (32 to 37).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Despite this, there is little cell death in the striatum of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Possibly, the striatal neurons gradually develop resistance to damage due to protracted low-grade excitotoxic stress (38).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The resistance to acute excitotoxic damage is correlated to the number of neurons exhibiting intranuclear inclusions in the R6/2 striatum (35) and this proportion is generally lower in the lateral hypothalamus (57% in this study) compared with the striatum ( > 95%) (39).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	111	What are the implications of our findings? Characterization of the death of orexin neurons may shed light on the cellular events leading to neuronal death in HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In addition, monitoring the loss of orexin-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus may also be an important index to measure therapeutic efficacy of novel drugs in R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Changes in sleep behavior and the occurrence of narcoleptic episodes constitute a functional outcome parameter to follow.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Although no studies showing that the HD patients actually suffer from symptoms similar to narcolepsy have been reported so far, sleep patterns are disturbed (40).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Indeed, HD patients have an abnormal sleep/wake cycle, and R6/2 mice exhibit a progressive disruption of circadian rhythms caused by dysregulation of circadian rhythm genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus (J.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Morton, personal communication).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Importantly, we have found that orexin fibers are lost in the R6/2 pineal region, which is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm via connections with the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	118	In HD, there are no state biomarkers available.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	119	 As plasma or CSF measurements of substances secreted from sites of neuropathology such as the hypothalamus are feasible, the identification of an affected neuronal subpopulation opens up new possibilities to identify such a marker.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In end-stage R6/2 mice, both the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the levels of orexin in the CSF were reduced by 72% compared with wild-type littermates.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	121	 This suggests that orexin could be used as a biomarker reflecting hypothalamic neurodegeneration.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Considering the substantial loss and atrophy of orexin also in the human condition, we hypothesize that symptomatic HD patients have reduced CSF orexin levels below the levels considered diagnostic for narcolepsy.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In healthy individuals, the normal orexin values in CSF are  > 200 pg/ml.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Orexin levels  < 110 pg/ml are diagnostic for narcolepsy (41).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Can one predict a similar decrease in HD patients? Our study shows that HD patients of Vonsattel grade II to III with around 43 CAG repeats (i.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	126	 mild to moderate cases), have completely lost 30% of the orexin neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The remaining 70% neurons have undergone an atrophy of the neuronal cross-sectional area by 40% (representing an even greater percentage loss in the volume of each cell), which taken together suggest a reduction in total cell volume (both atrophy and cell death considered) that would lead to a reduction in CSF levels of orexin below the diagnostic levels for narcolepsy.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Considering this scenario, CSF orexin levels could constitute a novel biomarker to assess disease progression and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Currently, such a biomarker is lacking in HD.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although the determination of synaptic interactions between HCRT and other hypothalamic systems provided the map via which signals may travel within the hypothalamus, that does not demonstrate whether that signaling modality is involved in homeostatic regulation.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	121	The present study provides the first suggestive evidence that the HCRT system of nonhuman primates is involved in the hypothalamic signal transduction associated with metabolic alterations.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The fact that short-term food withdrawal underlies robust activation of transcriptional mechanisms in the primate lateral hypothalamic HCRT system, together with the widespread distribution of HCRT projections in homeostatic centers and beyond, argues for a coordinating role for HCRT in autonomic, endocrine, and metabolic processes.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This assertion is in line with evidence that is available for the role of HCRT in the modulation of food intake, blood pressure, and arousal (3, 5, 6, 11, 12).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	124	In a previous study (4), the monkey ARC was found to receive a robust HCRT innervation, with HCRT axons heavily innervating NPY cells (4).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Whether this ARC NPY system may participate in the modulation of HCRT on food intake in primates, as suggested in the rat (13, 14), remains to be tested.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The present observation of HCRT input to fasting-activated NPY cells in the African green monkey lends support to this possibility.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that the activation of HCRT neurons by fasting occurs secondary to the activation of the ARC.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, ARC NPY cells are most likely protected by the blood-brain barrier, and the direct projection from the ARC to the lateral hypothalamus is not robust in the nonhuman primate (4).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	129	 It may also be plausible that, because of the HCRT system is heavily involved with the regulation of sleep/wake cycles, it is disturbance of sleep during fasting that affects HCRT neuronal function.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Alternatively, should metabolic signals affect HCRT cells during fasting, sleep disturbances may be the consequence HCRT neuronal activation.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	131	Leptin receptor immunoreactivity has been detected in the primate lateral hypothalamic HCRT cells (4), and leptin is suggested to cross the blood-brain barrier (15).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Thus, the observed induction of c-fos gene expression in the HCRT cells may be a direct consequence of the diminishing leptin levels we observed after the short-term fasting.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, fasting paradigms, particularly when used on primates, do not allow for the distinction of the effect of particular hormones, because they underlie complex responses of a variety of endocrine mechanisms.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	134	 For example, in the rodent, evidence is available to indicate that circulating insulin and/or glucose levels have a regulatory influence on hypothalamic HCRT expression (16).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Future studies will determine the extent of contribution of each of the involved humoral and metabolic signals in the activation of primate HCRT systems.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	136	Interestingly, in the hypothalamic nuclei (including the ARC, LH-PF, dorsomedial nucleus, and MPOA), in which short-term fasting induced c-fos expression the most robustly, activated cells received multiple HCRT inputs.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In rodents, HCRT exerts excitatory postsynaptic currents (17), and intracerebroventricular administration of HCRT induces c-fos expression in a manner not dissimilar to what we describe here in the nonhuman primate (18, 19).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Because all the synaptic membrane specializations between HCRT axons and c-fos-expressing perikarya in the primate hypothalamus were asymmetrical, stimulatory synapses, the activation of hypothalamic circuitry by metabolic challenge may be mediated, in part, by the HCRT system.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the central nervous system, the cell bodies producing orexins are localized in a narrow region within the lateral hypothalamus and project mainly to regions involved in feeding, sleep, and autonomic functions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Via putative pre- and postsynaptic effects, orexins increase synaptic activity in these regions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In isolated neurons and cells expressing recombinant receptors orexins cause Ca2+ elevation, which is mainly dependent on influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The activity of orexinergic cells appears to be controlled by feeding- and sleep-related signals via a variety of neurotransmitters/hormones from the brain and other tissues.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	13	OUR KNOWLEDGE of the orexinergic system was initiated in 1998 by two independent groups and approaches (reviewed in Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In January 1998, the group of Sutcliffe published a study (37) in which they predicted that a particular rat hypothalamic mRNA species ("clone 35"; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	15	 50) would code for a precursor peptide 130 amino acids (aa) in length, each molecule of which would generate two separate peptides of 39- and 29-aa lengths.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The peptides were named hypocretins, on the basis of their hypothalamic localization and their proposed sequence similarity to the secretin family of peptides; however, only orexin B bears any significant resemblance to secretin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The precursor peptide would thus be preprohypocretin and the two final peptides hypocretin (hcrt)-1 and hcrt-2.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Simultaneously with the work of the group of Sutcliffe, the group of Yanagisawa (154) isolated a hypothalamic 33-aa peptide that activated the orphan receptor HFGAN72.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This receptor was found also to respond to another peptide, 28 aa in length.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A second receptor was cloned on the basis of its sequence similarity to HFGAN72, and this receptor also responded to both isolated peptides with Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	21	 On the basis of the peptide sequences, Sakurai and coworkers (154) cloned the cDNA for the precursor peptide (130 aa in the rat).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The peptides were named orexins, because they increased food intake in nonfasted rats when injected into the lateral ventricle.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The precursor peptide thus became preproorexin, the 33- and 28-aa final peptides orexin A and orexin B, respectively, and the receptors OX1 and OX2 receptors.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Both preprohypocretin and preproorexin were found preferentially in the rat brain and more specifically in the hypothalamus (37, 154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Cellular and systemic responses to the peptides were observed in the rat.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Application of hcrt-2 increased postsynaptic current frequency in rat hypothalamic neurons in culture (37), and orexin A and -B increased food intake in nonfasted rats (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	27	It soon became clear that the peptides isolated by the two groups were, in principle, identical.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, there was an error in the peptide sequences deduced by de Lecea and coworkers (37), so that most authors refer to the accepted sequences by Sakurai et al.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	30	 (37) even when they are using the hypocretin nomenclature.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Therefore, the current praxis makes preproorexin = preprohypocretin, orexin A = hcrt-1, orexin B = hcrt-2, OX1 receptor = hcrtr-1, and OX2 receptor = hcrtr-2.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	32	 There is an ongoing argument concerning which nomenclature should be used.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To avoid confusion with the sequences we use the orexin nomenclature throughout this review.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	34	Today there is a wealth of information concerning the anatomic architecture of the orexinergic system as well as the systemic effects of orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The most prominent and well-demonstrated effect of orexins is undoubtedly regulation of sleep/wakefulness (reviewed in Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Although many other responses have been shown, their physiological significance is less clear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Effects on feeding behavior have been demonstrated in a multitude of studies, but the results are somewhat contradictory.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The current view is that orexins may rather regulate short-term appetite, energy metabolism, and feeding-associated processes (e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	39	, gastrointestinal functions, mastication).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Orexins also affect hormonal secretion, the most well-demonstrated effects being those on the hormones involved in the stress response and energy metabolism such as glucocorticoids and norepinephrine.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	41	 At the same time, information concerning the regulatory mechanisms of orexinergic systems and their targets on a cellular level is lagging behind.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In this review, we try to create a comprehensive picture of orexins and their proven and putative physiological role.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	52	Cleavage of one molecule of preproorexin and further modification leads to production of one molecule each of orexin A and orexin B; however, HPLC detection of orexins in the human brain suggests two- to fivefold higher levels of orexin B than orexin A in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS) (34, 35, 125, 126).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	88	In the original studies on orexin receptors two cellular responses were identified: recombinantly expressed orexin receptor strongly elevated Ca2+ in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (154), whereas in the hypothalamic neurons increased action potential frequency was observed (37).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Many systemic responses were described thereafter but the molecular mechanisms of these have not in most cases been investigated in detail.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	90	Both OX1 and OX2 receptors elevate Ca2+ when recombinantly expressed in CHO cells (67, 107, 138, 154, 168).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Because orexin receptors caused Ca2+ elevations of high magnitude in this cell line devoid of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, they were thought to couple to the phospholipase C-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-Ca2+ release cascade via the Gq family of G proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The orexins were subsequently shown to elevate intracellular Ca2+ in neuronal cell cultures from hypothalamus and cortex (183, 184).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The Ca2+ elevations in neurons were found to be independent of intracellular release and to require extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The requirement for extracellular Ca2+ is not a typical property of a Gq-mediated response, which consists of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by a "capacitative" Ca2+ entry to refill the stores.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The observed Ca2+ elevation in neurons was blocked by a bisindoylmaleimide protein kinase C inhibitor.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	96	 It was therefore suggested, that orexin receptors would activate protein kinase C, which would phosphorylate and thereby activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Similar findings were described by Uramura et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	98	 (181) in isolated rat ventral tegmental neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Orexin A was determined to elevate intracellular Ca2+ via activation of nitrendipine- and -conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The response was also sensitive to calphostin C (inhibitor of protein kinase C) and D609 (inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C), which suggested the following activation sequence: orexin receptor  phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C  protein kinase C  N-/L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels  influx of Ca2+.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Ca2+ elevation has also been measured in cultured rat embryonic spinal cord neurons, although the source of Ca2+ has not been investigated (182).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	111	What then is the general role of Ca2+ influx in orexin receptor-mediated cellular responses? In neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx has been observed by fura 2 measurements (181, 182-184) and is also suggested by electrophysiological measurements (44, 70).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Because orexins may depolarize neurons via block of K+ channels (see Depolarizing actions), some Ca2+ influx may even result from an indirect activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The situation may be more complex at other sites as discussed below.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	114	 (107) discovered that removal of extracellular Ca2+ caused a significant (8- to 100-fold) drop in the potency of orexin A for the OX1 receptor (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	115	 In other respects, the results of Smart et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	116	 (168) suggest qualities expected from Gq-dependent signaling, that is, sensitivity to the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122, rapid and transient spike, and extracellular Ca2+-dependent secondary phase (capacitative Ca2+ entry).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In contrast, a more detailed analysis of Ca2+ signaling in CHO cells indicated that the dependence of the Ca2+ response on extracellular Ca2+ is due to the activation of a Ca2+ influx pathway (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The Ca2+ response was abolished when the membrane potential was held close to the reversal potential of Ca2+ (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	119	 4B), and a Ca2+ elevation could be observed by returning to a negative holding potential (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In addition, orexin A activated an influx of Mn2+ ions in conditions where no intracellular release occurred.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The primary response to OX1 receptor stimulation in CHO cells is thus receptor-operated Ca2+ influx (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This Ca2+ influx amplifies phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, so that in the absence of Ca2+ influx, IP3 production and Ca2+ release occur with a potency 100 times lower than in the presence of Ca2+ influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Ca2+ elevation alone is not sufficient to activate phospholipase C in these cells, suggesting that Ca2+ influx acts in concert with a G protein-mediated mechanism.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The identity of this Ca2+ influx pathway and its activation mechanism by the orexin receptors remains unresolved; however, the potency of pharmacological blockers suggests that it is a different molecular entity than the store-operated Ca2+ channel in CHO cells (96).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	125	 It thus seems that both in neuronal and nonneuronal cells orexin receptors activate both Ca2+ influx and the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C pathway, a view that is supported by a study in which orexin receptors are heterologously expressed in a variety of different cell types (Holmqvist, Akerman, and Kukkonen, unpublished observation).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In a recent study, orexin A and -B equipotently increased norepinephrine release from rat cerebrocortical slices.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Ca2+ response to orexin A is only seen at the negative holding potential, which indicates that Ca2+ influx is required for the response.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	138	Functional experiments indicate that in addition to Ca2+ release and activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels, there are several types of Ca2+ influx pathways activated by G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Although in most cases the mechanisms have not been clarified, these pathways may be activated directly by G protein subunits or second messengers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	140	 These pathways may be identical or related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family (reviewed in Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The TRP genes encode a family of over 20 proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Many of the TRP gene products form Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels, and some members of the TRP (super)family even have inherent protein kinase or ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase domains.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	143	 TRP channels are widely expressed in mammalian cells, and they are activated after Gq-coupled receptor stimulation but the activation mechanisms are in many cases unknown.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It will be interesting to see whether any of the TRP channels can be held responsible for the orexin receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Characterization of receptor-mediated electrical responses in neuronal preparations is performed with some common electrophysiological techniques.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In many situations in which intracellular recordings are difficult, extracellular electrodes can be more practical to use and they are likely to induce much less cellular damage.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	147	 On the other hand, these response measurements are usually limited to the registration of action potential frequency.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Measurements with intracellular electrodes (normal or microelectrodes) can be performed with feedback amplification allowing voltage or current clamp or in a "free-running" mode, in which case voltage changes are monitored.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These latter methods, most importantly, offer better possibilities for investigation of the mechanisms underlying the electrical activity than the extracellular electrodes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	150	Recordings from neurons are usually performed in slices or similar preparations, in which cells are synaptically coupled.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The cell measured can thus be the target for upstream signals rather than responding directly to orexins themselves.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The usual way of eliminating the secondary effects far upstream of the measured cell is to use tetrodotoxin (TTX).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	153	 By blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels this hinders action potential propagation in most neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, TTX will not, for instance, block direct effects of orexins on the presynaptic terminal most immediately upstream of the cell investigated.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Therefore, TTX does not exclusively separate pre- and postsynaptic effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channelsand therefore transmitter releasecan be blocked with, for example, Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and more specific drugs or toxins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, orexin receptors may activate Ca2+ channels not sensitive to these inhibitors (see Ca2+ Elevation).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	158	 On the other hand, these blockers may also affect, for instance, orexin-activated Ca2+ channels other than the voltage-gated channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This may lead to a block of both pre- and postsynaptic responses to orexin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	160	 As an example of this, Ni2+ blocks voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, some orexin-activated non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (96), and even the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (91).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	161	 "Synaptic isolation" is performed by using medium with low extracellular Ca2+ ( > 0.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This widely used method appears to block electrically evoked synaptic transmission, but the mechanistic basis for it is unclear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Similarly as above, it is unknown whether this method would affect orexin-mediated presynaptic responses if these were mediated by other than voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or by Ca2+ release.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	165	 It is also difficult to preclude possible postsynaptic effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	166	Some methods give a clearer separation of pre- and postsynaptic responses.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Dissociation of the cells removes presynaptic contacts.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, even in this case it is possible, although unlikely, that responses are mediated by some indirect messengers released from neighboring cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Measurement of synaptic activity is a method often used for studies of receptor-coupled mechanisms.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Increased/decreased frequency of excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC, respectively) by orexins suggests a stimulatory effect on transmitter release, i.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	171	 When the amplitude of a synaptic current is increased, it is difficult to conclude whether the response is pre- or postsynaptic.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The most common electrophysiological response to orexins appears to be increase in spontaneous or evoked action potential frequency, as observed with extracellular or intracellular electrodes.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Action potentials and their enhancement with orexins are blocked by TTX (3, 44, 54, 70, 75, 165, 170, 195) but usually not by synaptic isolation with low Ca2+-high Mg2+ (8, 42, 93, 147) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channel block with Cd2+ (170).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The latter data therefore suggest that orexins would directly affect the postsynaptic neurons at some sites, with reservations for the methodological shortcomings (see above).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	185	 These spikes may be caused by Ca2+ channels or TTX-insensitive Na+ channels.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	188	 EPSCs and IPSCs are blocked by TTX in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19, 54) but not in rat hypothalamus (49, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Therefore, the orexin receptor mediating these putative presynaptic responses may lie farther upstream in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In both of these sites, depolarization mediated by orexins persists in the presence of TTX, suggesting that orexin receptors are expressed both on the cell investigated and on some upstream neuron.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In some cases, the released transmitters causing the postsynaptic currents have been investigated with receptor blockers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In mouse laterodorsal tegmental neurons, the orexin-mediated elevation in the EPSC frequency is attenuated by ionotropic glutamate receptor block, whereas the (postsynaptic) depolarization response is not affected (19).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In rat embryonic hypothalamic neurons in culture, hypocretin 2 (orexin B) increases IPSC and EPSC frequency in a TTX-insensitive manner (49, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The former is blocked by GABAA receptor block and the latter by ionotropic glutamate receptor block.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In rat superficial dorsal horn neurons, orexin B-mediated increase in IPSC frequency is inhibited by glycine receptor block (54).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Amplitudes of the postsynaptic currents or potentials are also sometimes affected, as reported for guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia [reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitude; Ref.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This depolarization also results, when investigated, without exception in increased action potential frequency, and often the depolarization has been studied in the presence of TTX to block this "disturbance" (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	216	The orexin-stimulated increases in current most probably reflect direct effects of orexin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Evidence for this includes the stable currents and lack of effect of TTX, "synaptic block," or other kinds of elimination of EPSCs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	218	 What then is the mechanism of this depolarization? In rat lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive neurons, locus ceruleus, autonomic preganglionic neurons of intermediolateral cell column, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and in guinea pig ileal S-type submucosal neurons, increased input resistance (by 2-85%) has been measured to co-occur with the depolarization (3, 75, 80, 92, 103).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This suggests that orexins may inhibit K+ channels, which is also suggested by the reduced afterhyperpolarization amplitude observed in rat locus ceruleus and in guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia (70, 92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Also, the current-voltage relationship, when measured, suggests K+ channel inhibition (rat locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus; Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	221	 On the other hand, orexins may activate Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, as suggested in mouse peritoneal macrophages (76).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It is interesting that orexins instead inhibit the slow afterhyperpolarization in locus ceruleus, which is thought to depend on Ca2+-activated K+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is possible that orexins do not elevate Ca2+ at all sites or that other signals generated by the receptor activation counteract the effect of Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	224	In other cases, reduced input resistance or noise is associated with the orexin-induced depolarization.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This has been seen in rat tuberomamillary nucleus (44), rat lumbar spinal cord (54), and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In hypothalamic histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B both depolarize and increase the firing rate (8, 44, 195) (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This depolarization is abolished by removal of extracellular Na+ and virtually unaffected by an increase in extracellular K+ (44).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Pharmacological block of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger reduces the depolarization, suggesting that it may be mediated by Ca2+ elevation-induced activation of electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The residual depolarization is blocked by Ni2+, which may suggest that the putatively underlying Ca2+ current can also slightly depolarize the cells itself.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Even in rat dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, a part of the current appears to depend on Na+ and the remaining part may be caused by K+ channel block (75).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	231	Finally, no clear change in the input resistance may be seen [rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (165), locus ceruleus (56, 170), and intermediolateral cell column (3)].
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This could occur if the increased conductance caused by opening of some ion channels (Na+, Ca2+?) was compensated by the closure of other channels (K+) or if orexins rather affected transporters.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Even in a single cell, orexins may utilize several mechanisms for depolarization (44, 75).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	234	Summary of orexin effects on electrical activity of neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Thus orexins most often increase neuronal activity via presynaptic effects (increased transmitter release via unknown mechanisms) and via postsynaptic depolarization (block of K+ channels, activation of cation channels and electrogenic transporters?).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Some of the effects such as the putative K+ channel inhibition are typical for Gq-coupled receptors (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Other mechanisms may be secondary to the Ca2+ elevation or may depend on the activation of nonselective cation channels like the TRP channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	238	 On particular neurons, orexins may also cause inhibition via increased inhibitory transmitter release or via decreased postsynaptic effects of excitatory transmitters.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	239	 It is unclear which direct or indirect roles Ca2+ transients play in electrical responses to orexins, and not much effort has been put into investigation of this to date.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Independent of the method of measurement of electrical activity, the effects of orexins usually have a slow onset of action (10 s-4 min) and the recovery is even slower (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	241	 3, 9, 19, 44, 54, 75, 93, 103, 159, 165, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Most studies have been performed with slices, a preparation in which perfusion of orexins in and out may be slow.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, because rather superficial neurons are patched, there is no obvious reason why the perfusate would not reach the neurons immediately.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Furthermore, similar slow onset (10- to 20-s lag, 1 min to maximum) and delayed offset ( > 2 min to complete decay after removal) are seen in dissociated neurons (195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Therefore, it is possible that orexins affect ion channels via, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	246	, phosphorylation rather than direct G protein interaction.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Some results indicate involvement of protein kinase A and -C in orexin responses (93, 181, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Orexin B has been reported to reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current amplitude by 19% and to enhance GABA-induced current amplitude by 48% in dissociated rat nucleus accumbens cells (113); this could also possibly be a phosphorylation-dependent event.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	249	As discussed in Increased synaptic activity, orexins may increase transmitter release as indicated by increased/decreased synaptic potential frequency.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These are the most direct indications of presynaptic effects of orexins, and in the presence of TTX, rather certainly suggest a presynaptic site for orexin effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Inhibition of K+-stimulated serotonin release by orexin A and -B from rat hypothalamic synaptosomes also directly shows a presynaptic site of action (140).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	252	 There are also indirect indications of orexin-stimulated transmitter release from in vitro slice (norepinephrine from rat cerebral cortex; Ref.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In these cases, it is impossible to tell whether orexins directly affect the releasing neurons or some upstream neurons; some complex mechanism is suggested by the delayed (by 6 min) response in rat cerebrocortical slices.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	255	cAMP elevation in response to orexin stimulation was reported in the rat and human adrenal cortices, putatively via OX1 receptors (110, 117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In contrast, in primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurons, no elevation of cAMP is seen (183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Elevation of cAMP may occur by several mechanisms depending on the isoform of adenylyl cyclase expressed.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Adenylyl cyclase isoforms are differentially activated by Ca2+, protein kinase C, and G protein -subunits (171), and the expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms may be different in the adrenal cortex and the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	259	 G proteins might also be expressed tissue-specifically, and OX1 and OX2 receptors could couple to different G proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	260	 OX2 receptors have been reported to couple to Gi and Gs but not Go or Gq proteins in human fetal adrenal glands (88) and to Gi, Gs, and Gq but not Go proteins in adult human adrenal glands (146), as measured with the GTP-azidoanilide labeling method.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	261	Orexin receptors may also couple to protein kinase cascades involved in cell growth, differentiation, and death.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	262	 These effects are clearly seen when orexin receptors are expressed in CHO cells (S.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	264	 One of the most immediate indications is the rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways seen on OX1 receptor stimulation (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Both 3 and 100 nM orexin A lead to rapid (3 min) activation of mainly ERK2, a response that is more clearly decreased at the 30 min time point at the lower concentration.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	270	OX1 and OX2 receptors were already shown in the original study to have different binding affinities for orexin A and -B (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	271	 When expressed recombinantly in CHO cells, OX1 receptor has 10 times higher affinity for orexin A than for orexin B whereas OX2 receptor binds orexin A and -B with equal affinity.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The same selectivity is seen with respect to Ca2+ elevation; thus orexin A activates OX1 receptors up to 10 times more potently than orexin B (138, 154, 168).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Thus the evidence for selectivity of OX1 receptor and nonselectivity of OX2 receptor between orexin A and -B is based solely on the studies on Ca2+ elevation in recombinant CHO cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	274	 It is difficult to find exclusive expression of one subtype in any tissue, but in some cases support for this selectivity can be found: orexin A is 5.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	275	5-fold more potent in increasing electrical activity of rat locus ceruleus, where OX1 expression dominates (170).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In isolated human adrenocortical cells, where OX1 mRNA is also predominantly found, orexin A but not orexin B stimulates cortisol secretion (117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In tissues where OX2 expression dominates, such as rat tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B are essentially equipotent in stimulating the electrical activity.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Orexin A and -B are also equally potent in releasing catecholamines from human pheochromocytoma cells, which only express OX2 mRNA (116).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	279	 On the other hand, the putatively OX2-mediated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release is 10-fold less sensitive to orexin B than to orexin A (13, 158).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	280	 It is generally dangerous to rely on so-called selective agonists, because their efficacies can be very dependent on receptor and G protein expression levels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	281	 For these pharmacological reasons and because of the chemical differences between orexin A and -B (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), conclusions on receptor subtype involvement based on potency of orexin variants (42, 113, 138, 158) should probably be avoided.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Some studies report higher potency of orexin B than orexin A with respect to some responses (76, 85), which is unexplainable on the basis of recombinant pharmacology.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Even if any pharmacological selectivity with respect to the interaction of orexin A and -B with the orexin receptor subtypes was to occur in the tissues, its physiological significance would be unclear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	284	Molecular determinants required from orexin peptides for binding to and activation of orexin receptors have been investigated in CHO cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Comparison of structures and activities of orexin A and -B suggests that the NH2-terminal amino acids are less important for receptor binding and activation than the COOH-terminal amino acids (33).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Truncation of orexin A to orexin A15-33 reduces its potency for both OX1 and OX2 receptors 20- to 60-fold (33, 138), and further truncation successively abolishes the Ca2+ response, at least for OX1 (33).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Mutation of cystine-forming cysteines to alanines in orexin A reduces the potency of the mutant peptides for both OX1 and OX2 receptors ~10-fold (138).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, it is difficult to judge whether this effect is due to the lost disulfide bridges or the exchanged cysteines themselves.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	289	 One-by-one replacement of each amino acid in orexin-A15-33 with alanine (alanine scan) has revealed regions of particular importance for orexin A activation of the OX1 receptor, in particular leucines 19 and 20 and the most COOH-terminal aa 26-33 seem to be of great importance (33).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	312	 From this perspective, it is unfortunate that SB-334867 is not widely available for orexin receptor researchers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	313	Recently, a variety of peptide transmitters, including secretin and NPY variants, were reported to inhibit orexin A binding to membrane preparations from endogenous and recombinant cells expressing OX1 receptors, even with a nanomolar affinity (87).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	314	 These results were interpreted to indicate that interaction between orexinergic and NPYergic systems (see Connections of orexinergic pathways with other feeding-regulating transmitters/hormones) could occur at the orexin receptor level.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	315	 These results on binding could not, however, be verified in functional experiments or in binding experiments with intact cells (67, 169).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Other peptides [secretin, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), NPY variants] do not display any detectable affinity or activity on OX1 or OX2 receptors (67, 169).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	317	 67, it is more likely that the other peptides affect some intracellular process, for instance G protein binding to the receptor, which is required for high-affinity agonist binding, and therefore reduce orexin binding in some particular preparations.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Therefore, secretin should not be used to define specific orexin A binding, because this can to lead to possibly erroneous conclusions (86, 188).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	319	The distribution of orexinergic cells has been investigated with molecular biological and immunological methods, which give rather similar results.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	324	In the rat brain, orexinergic cell bodies are found solely in the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Within the hypothalamus these cell bodies reside bilaterally symmetrically in the lateral parts, probably most abundantly in perifornical areas (17, 24, 31, 36, 37, 56, 58, 69, 70, 131).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Orexinergic cells are interspersed among melanocyte-concentrating hormone (MCH)-ergic cells (24, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	327	 However, the overlap of the areas is not complete (17) and MCHergic cells are clearly different from orexinergic cells (17, 43, 58, 143), although they otherwise share some of the properties of orexinergic cells (1, 69, 71).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Isolated orexinergic cell bodies have also been reported in median eminence, posterior, dorsal, and dorsomedial hypothalamus, and arcuate and subincertal nuclei (24, 31, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	329	Orexinergic neurons are variable in size (diameter of cell body = 15-40  microm) and shape (spherical, fusiform, multipolar) (24, 31, 36, 131), and they have been assumed to number from 1,100 to 3,400 in the whole rat brain (61, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Because orexinergic cells have been shown to project to other orexinergic cells within the hypothalamus (69) there might be different populations of orexinergic cells within the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	331	Preproorexin mRNA and protein have even been detected in the ependymal cell layer (97, 143), and orexin A has been found in choroid plexi (31).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	358	Similar amounts of OX1 and OX2 mRNA are found in the rat brain as a whole, and OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNAs mostly show similar distribution, although some differences are seen (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	363	 A particularly interesting finding is the expression of OX2 receptor protein in the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum (30); earlier studies had failed to detect any orexin receptors or their mRNA in the cerebellum although orexinergic fibers were projecting to the cerebellum.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Otherwise, the immunohistochemical studies suggest a distribution generally similar to that from the mRNA measurements, although some differences are seen.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	434	 In some cases, direct effects of orexins on isolated organs or even isolated cells have been demonstrated; we have been trying to highlight this kind of evidence.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	435	Effects of Orexins on Feeding Behavior.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	436	In the original publication dealing with orexins, it was shown that intracerebroventricular injection of orexins induces feeding in rats (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	437	 When injected into different hypothalamic sites in the rat, orexin A is effective only in a narrow area (perifornical area, lateral hypothalamus, and dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei but not in preoptic area or arcuate or ventromedial nucleus) whereas orexin B is inactive (39, 173).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Some of the hypothalamic nuclei possibly involved in feeding responses to orexins are listed in Table 3.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Intraperitoneally injected OX1 receptor antagonist (SB-334867) inhibits baseline feeding, normal weight gain, and the feeding response to orexin injection in the hypothalamus (62, 150).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	440	 The feeding-stimulating effect of fasting is blocked by intracisternally administered anti-orexin A antibodies (192) and intraperitoneal SB-334867 (62).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	441	 This suggests that at least the OX1 receptor is involved in the natural regulation of feeding, but both orexin receptor subtypes are expressed in the nuclei involved in the regulation of feeding (Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Orexin A increases c-fos expression in areas of energy regulatory sites within the hypothalamus, the limbic region, and the hindbrain (128).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	443	 As mentioned above (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS), orexins belong to a regulatory network of peptides, including NPY, MCH, AGRP, galanin, POMC products, CART, and dynorphin, which regulate feeding behavior.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	444	 Orexins appear to act upstream of NPY as antagonists to the NPY Y1 or Y5 receptors block orexin-stimulated feeding (38, 81).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	445	The degree to which orexins regulate long-term food intake is subject to debate; some data indicate rather that orexin-induced food intake is only an acute effect and is evened out by compensatory decrease in food intake within 24 h (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	446	 It can be speculated that part of orexin-induced food intake is secondary to increased wakefulness and activity and therefore following increased energy expenditure.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	447	 A general view emerging from the different results is that orexins may participate in the short-term regulation of energy homeostasis by initiating feeding in response to falls in glucose, but the subsequent increase in glucose, leptin, and visceral signals would decrease orexin, which in its turn would terminate the behavior after food ingestion (Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Mapping of orexinergic projections indicates that orexins could also be involved in the overall regulation of feeding.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	449	 For instance, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nucleus, and lamina 1 and 10 of the sacral cord receive afferents from the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, motor trigeminal nucleus, intermediolateral cell column, and sacral parasympathetic nucleus give rise to nerves that innervate the gastrointestinal tract and muscles of mastication (31, 34, 36, 131, 143, 182, 198).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	450	 Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that central orexinergic nerves could be involved in the primary eating process via sensory and motor innervation of the mouth and in the passage of food through the gastrointestinal tract via sensory, motor, and secretomotor innervation of the intestines.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	453	 Some direct data (6, 106, 124, 175, 186, 197) and indirect observations from narcoleptic patients and animal models (23, 60, 162, 193) suggest that orexins may affect metabolic rate or heat loss or related processes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	454	 An overall role in energy metabolism is also suggested by the effects of orexins on the release of hormones, especially adrenal steroids (see Orexins in Autonomic/Endocrine Functions).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	459	 OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNA expression within these areas suggests that both receptor subtypes are involved (Table 3).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	460	Injection of orexin A into rat cerebral ventricles or into the more specific CNS sites in the rat or cat increases wakefulness and decreases sleep (15, 45, 56, 72, 120, 144).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Most markedly, the effects are seen as decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep episode number and duration.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	462	 A profound role of histaminergic systems in these processes is suggested by results that show that these effects of orexin A in the mouse are blocked by histamine H1 receptor antagonists or gene disruption (72, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Narcoleptic dogs with disrupted OX2 receptors have decreased brain histamine content (134), and OX2 receptor seems to be responsible for orexin effects on the tuberomamillary nucleus even in the rat (44, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Expression of c-fos has been shown to increase mainly in orexin-positive cells of the hypothalamus at the time of normal waking of rats, and c-fos expression is also increased by sleep deprivation and by the antinarcoleptic drugs metamphetamine and mofanadil (23, 46, 161).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	465	Cellular responses to orexins have been observed in areas involved in sleep.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	474	Orexins may affect the water balance via effects on drinking, water/salt homeostasis, or mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation, as suggested by the anatomy of the projections (24, 31, 34, 36, 37, 61, 69-71, 125, 126, 154, 182).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	475	 In fact, intracerebroventricular orexin A and -B increase water intake in the rat (98, 149).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Injection of orexin A or -B into particular brain stem sites increases mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the rat (3, 25, 156, 166).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	477	 To some extent these effects may be mediated by increased release of hormones, such as (nor)epinephrine (3, 166).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	490	 CRF release has been suggested to be mediated by elevated NPY acting on Y1 receptors (83, 152), placing NPY downstream of orexins even in this system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	491	 Orexin A can even stimulate CRF release in vitro (151).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	492	 A CRF receptor antagonist has been reported to block orexin-stimulated plasma corticosterone elevation in the rat (82, 159); on the other hand, orexins have been reported to inhibit CRF-stimulated ACTH release from cultured rat adenohypophysial cells (158).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	494	 This release is independent of ACTH (110, 117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	495	 Corticosterone/cortisol release has been determined to co-occur with cAMP elevation and probably to depend on it [rat (110), human (117)].
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	496	 This, together with the lack of additivity between orexin A and ACTH, suggests that these peptides utilize the same mechanism for glucocorticoid release (117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	497	 In contrast, no direct effect on rat adrenal slices was seen by Jaszberenyi et al.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	499	Release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from rat adrenal medulla is increased by intracerebroventricular orexins (166), and a similar although smaller effect is seen in cultured porcine adrenal medullar cells (132).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	500	 Both OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNA have been suggested to be expressed in the rat adrenal medulla (104), although other studies present opposing views (84).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	501	Orexin-mediated increases in CRF, ACTH, corticosterone, aldosterone, vasopressin, and epinephrine release suggest that orexins could mediate stress responses.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	502	 Interesting in this context, orexins increase particular stereotypic behavioral patterns, such as grooming, face washing, and burrowing, which may be related to activation of stress response (40, 45, 77, 78).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	503	 Orexin A-induced grooming is inhibited by OX1 receptor block with SB-334867 (40), and a CRF receptor antagonist inhibits orexin-induced face washing and grooming by ~50% and the shift from rest to locomotor activity by 70-80% (78).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	504	 Involvement of complex pathways is highlighted by inhibitory effects of dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonists (40, 115, 130).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	505	 It should be noted that orexins increase wakefulness and/or activity of the rat, and it is therefore important to be able to separate these effects from the stress response.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	512	 Fasting increases the number of orexin A-immunoreactive submucosal neurons in the guinea pig, most of which also become positive for phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	513	 This, similar to c-fos expression, indicates activation of the neurons, suggesting that fasting activates both central and peripheral orexinergic systems.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	515	 Interestingly, some enterochromaffin cells of the rat also 1) express orexin receptors (OX2) and 2) are localized at close proximity to orexinergic nerve fibers (133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	516	 At the cellular level, orexin A induces electrical responses in guinea pig submucosal neurons (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	517	 Thus orexinergic neurons in the gastrointestinal tract could affect intestinal secretion and uptake, endocrine secretion, sensory signaling, and intestinal motility.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	518	 Different effects on intestinal motility patterns have indeed been measured in mouse and rat small intestine (133, 160) and in guinea pig distal colon (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	519	 Different orexin receptor subtypes have different distribution in the gastrointestinal tract; OX1 receptor immunoreactivity is solely expressed by the submucosal and myenteric neurons, whereas OX2 receptor immunoreactivity is only seen in the enterochromaffin cells in the rat (133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	520	Energy metabolism is regulated by several hormones, the most important being pancreatic glucagon and insulin, hypophysial growth hormone, glucocorticoids, (nor)epinephrine, and thyroid hormones.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	528	 Narcolepsy in humans is usually a sporadic disease; its strong association with some major histocompatibility complex antigens (especially HLA-DRB1*15, HLA-DQA1*0102, and HLA-DQB1*0602) has for a long time been suggested to relate it to some autoimmune process.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	530	 This could, however, be caused 1) by the fact that postmortem narcoleptic brains are usually investigated years after disease onset and 2) by the dispersed nature of the orexinergic cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	531	 Orexin A is undetectable in the CSF of most human narcoleptic patients (32, 135), the number of orexinergic neurons in postmortem narcoleptic brains is much reduced (142, 178), and even signs of gliosis have been observed (178).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	532	 At the same time MCHergic neurons, at the same brain areas, are present in normal numbers (142, 178).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	533	 This, together with the animal model systems (see below), has led to the hypothesis of narcolepsy as a disease of orexinergic neurons.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	547	 One other polymorphism concerns the reported sequence for the OX1 receptors (aa 280; see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), although this could be a sequencing error.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	548	 One mutation, Leu16Arg, found in the 5'-signal peptide region of the human preproorexin gene probably results in early-onset, severe narcolepsy (142).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	549	 When transiently expressed in Neuro-2A cells, the mutated peptide apparently accumulated in some tubular network, presumably smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in contrast to the wild-type preproorexin, which appeared in vesicles.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	550	 Another point mutation in the 5'-untranslated region may be involved in disease process in the presence of a particular type of tissue antigen (HLA-DR2; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	551	 Insertion of an adenosine at 593 (promoter region) has been found in one narcoleptic patient, although the effect of this on pathogenicity is unclear (51).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	552	Thus there is strong evidence that narcolepsy is caused by reduced orexinergic signaling via either destruction of orexinergic neurons or defective orexin peptides or receptors, although larger population studies are necessary to confirm this.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	553	 OX2 receptor appears to be especially involved in the dog, which would promote the role of nuclei relying on this receptor subtype, such as tuberomamillary nucleus, although it is possible that OX1 and OX2 receptors have different distributions in rats and humans compared with dogs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	554	Orexinergic disorders may also provide some interesting information on the role of orexins in feeding.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	555	 Patients with narcolepsy show somewhat increased body mass index compared with healthy subjects (162).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	556	 Both of the two previously described kinds of orexin-transgenic mice are hypophagic, but preproorexin knockout mice are lean (23) as opposed to orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which are obese (60).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	557	 It is thus possible that preproorexin knockout mice develop some compensatory mechanisms for weight regulation whereas orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which lose their orexinergic neurons postnatally (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), will not be able to do this.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	558	 Another interesting possibility was recently proposed by Chou et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	559	 Essentially all the mouse lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons express dynorphin (10, 27), removal of which in orexinergic neuron-deficient mice might be responsible for the more pronounced phenotype.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	560	Although the anatomic architecture of the orexinergic system in the CNS is well characterized, there are several open questions as to the actual roles of orexins in central and peripheral functions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	561	 What are the mechanisms of action of orexins at the cellular level? Have all orexin receptors been identified? Are there presynaptic inhibitory orexin receptors in the brain? The limited access to orexin-responding neurons is an experimental problem.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	562	 There are several limitations concerning the methods available for the characterization of the functional properties of these cells in slice preparations or acutely isolated cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	563	 Model systems based on cultured neurons or even neuronal stem cells might provide an important improvement for studies of orexin signaling.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	564	 The CHO cell lines available have provided insight in functions of the orexinergic system and have enabled screening for orexin receptor ligands, but all the data obtained may not be relevant for the nervous system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	565	 Recombinant models based on neurons or neuronlike cells might therefore provide further information about the signal pathways used by orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	566	What role do the orexin cells play in the regulation of feeding? Available information suggests that at least one population of the orexinergic cells in the lateral hypothalamus directly monitors and responds to changes in glucose concentration in their environment and may also directly respond to signals inhibiting feeding such as leptin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	567	 Are these orexinergic cells the ones that project to areas in brain involved in feeding behavior? Orexin receptors are expressed in high numbers in several regions within the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	568	 Do these regulate the release of other feeding-related neurotransmitters? The regulation of feeding seems to be complex, involving many other neuropeptides, and there seems to be a gross redundancy in the system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	569	 Blocking of the orexinergic system by various means will reduce feeding, but permanent deletion of the orexinergic system has marginal or controversial effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	570	 Thus even an increase rather than the expected decrease in body mass may occur on deletions of different components of the orexinergic system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	571	The role of orexins in sleep seems clearer in light of the connection of the narcoleptic phenotype to orexin cell loss and the similar symptomatology occurring in functional orexin or orexin receptor loss.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	572	 In this context it also appears quite clear that a major part of orexin effects is mediated via monoaminergic systems, which regulate cholinergic pathways involved in the initiation of REM sleep (reviewed in, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	573	 Yet it is unclear how the activity of the orexinergic cells themselves is regulated.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	574	 Use of orexin antagonists as hypnotics could prove rewarding because many commonly used hypnotics interfere with REM sleep and cause tolerance, addiction, and memory disturbances.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	575	 An interesting question is whether there is an overlap between cells regulating feeding and sleep in the lateral hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	576	 Is, for instance, feeding behavior associated with arousal effects of orexins? Possibilities in the future to devise better pharmacological methods for identification of different orexinergic neurons as well as for manipulating their function will hopefully give answers to these questions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	577	One of the most intriguing questions concerns what roles orexins play in the periphery.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	578	 Do they act as hormones/paracrine mediators? The presence of orexins and their receptors in many peripheral organs such as the intestine, endocrine pancreas, adrenals, and pituitary suggests that this may be the case.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	579	 Could orexins even transmit signals from the periphery to the CNS? As discussed above, the few studies available suggest separate "peripheral" and "central" orexinergic systems.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	580	 In some studies changes in central orexin concentrations are not reflected in the periphery, and in narcoleptics devoid of central orexins, orexins are still found in the plasma.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	581	 This may indicate that the plasma orexin levels reflect peripherally produced orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	582	 Are the peripheral orexin receptors similar to the central? At least in the adrenal cortical zona fasciculata/reticularis orexin receptors appear to couple to cAMP elevation and not to Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	583	 Does this reflect different receptor subtypesas suggested by some studiesor coupling to different signal pathways? Cell lines and primary cultures from peripheral tissues should provide a lot of the missing information in this context.

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	3	Although it is clear that the orexin/hypocretin peptides have a significant, physiologically relevant role in sleep/wakefulness, a broader picture has emerged indicating metabolic actions that may depend upon both neural and endocrine mechanisms for their manifestation.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The ability of exogenous peptide to activate sympathetic tone, increase locomotor activity, and alter feeding behavior, together with the observed alterations in those functions in knockout animals, strongly suggests important neural actions of the endogenous orexins/hypocretins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Likewise, the action of exogenously administered peptides to alter endocrine function, in particular corticotropin release, has now been mirrored by potential endocrinopathies in knockout animals.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Thus these pluripotent peptides hold great potential not only for the treatment of human narcolepsy but also to provide insight into the coordinated regulation of multiple physiological systems.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	7	food intake; autonomic nervous system; narcolepsy; corticotropin; corticosterone.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	8	A REMARKABLE CONVERGENCE of independent efforts occurred early in 1998, when the La Jolla and Dallas groups simultaneously reported the predicted (6) or elucidated (29) structures of two peptides that would become named the hypocretins (6) or, alternatively, the orexins (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These peptides, known to be processed from the same prohormone, were recognized to be produced in brain in a remarkably circumscribed location, the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area, a region known to be important in feeding behavior (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Axonal projections to multiple brain sites (4-6, 21, 25, 29, 38) predicted a diversity of biological actions, and it was clear from the beginning that the peptides exerted membrane effects similar to recognized neurotransmitters (6, 8, 42) and might have a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of feeding behavior (13, 29, 31).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For simplicity, these peptides will be referred to as the orexins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Orexin A (hypocretin-1) is a 33-amino acid peptide with two internal disulfide linkages, a pyroglutamyl residue in the NH2 terminus and an amidated COOH terminus.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Orexin B (hypocretin-2) is 28 amino acids in length, lacks internal disulfide bonds, but similarly has an amidated COOH terminus.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In their initial description of the orexins, Yanigisawa's group (Sakurai et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	15	 29) also identified the two orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although both are G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R appears to couple via the Gq/11 subclass of heteromeric receptors, and OX2R may couple through either the Gq/11 or the Gi/o subclasses (29, 42).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It is clear that OX1R prefers orexin A as a ligand, whereas OX2R binds orexin A or orexin B with similar affinities (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Finally, it should be recognized that, in addition to a broad projection field originating from the orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic/perifornical area, unique distributions of OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist (17, 19, 29, 41), establishing the potential for the development of pharmacological agents that interact uniquely at a single subclass of orexin receptor and therefore act as selective agonists or antagonists for specific biological actions of the endogenous peptides.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	19	Although it is agreed that exogenously applied orexin can stimulate feeding and that orexin production is determined by the metabolic state of the animal (see review by Mieda and Yanagisawa, Ref.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	20	 20), most investigators recognize the effects of the orexins to be less potent than those of neuropeptide Y (NPY; see review by Smart et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, it must be recognized that multiple peptide systems interact to control the feeding response, and the hierarchy within those systems is not clearly established.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Pretreatment with NPY antagonists significantly decreased the feeding response to exogenously administered orexin (7, 44), suggesting that NPY neurons are located downstream in the "wiring" diagram; however, evidence does exist for a potential opposite to be true, i.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	23	, orexin neurons located farther downstream to NPY in a series circuit controlling feeding (22).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is strong evidence for the innervation of NPY neurons by orexin terminals in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (5, 11), and central administration of a dose of orexin that stimulated feeding significantly increased NPY mRNA in that nuclear group as well (16).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Convincing evidence for a physiologically relevant role for the endogenous orexins in the CNS control of feeding comes from passive immunoneutralization studies, in which compromise of the bioactivity of endogenous orexin (22, 43) with neutralizing antibodies reduced feeding in response to an overnight fast.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	26	 At least one group, with access to the compound, observed decreased feeding in response to exogenously applied orexin or fast-induced feeding after administration of the relatively selective nonpeptide OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (27).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Orexin knockout mice (preprohormone gene deletion) ate less than wild-type littermates (2), again suggesting a physiologically relevant role for endogenous orexin in the regulation of appetite.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, these mice grew normally; thus some other determinant of growth or body weight must compensate for the decreased feeding.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	29	 There are two excellent possibilities: motor activity and metabolic state.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	30	Early on, it was recognized that orexins stimulated motor activity and apparently increased arousal state (8, 30).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The peptides also stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity (3, 30, 34, 36), and it was thought that the increase in feeding might actually have been secondary to the increased arousal state or metabolic demand (18).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It is clear that locomotor activity and time spent in the awake state increased in the animals administered orexin (8).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, in addition to stimulating feeding, these peptides stimulated energy expenditure (45).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Things became much clearer when Yanagisawa and colleagues (Chemelli et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	35	 2) once again demonstrated their technical expertise by developing an orexin gene knockout mouse.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This model proved the importance of the endogenous orexin system to sleep/wakefulness but at the same time cast doubt on the physiological relevance of the observed effects of the peptides on feeding behavior and metabolism.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These mice displayed a behavioral phenotype quite similar to human and canine models of narcolepsy (2, 15, 25), with distinct periods of behavioral arrest and the intrusion of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep into the normal waking state.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	38	 If the primary function of the orexins were to control feeding and metabolic rate, as the pharmacological studies had suggested, then these animals would have been expected to display phenotypic changes reflective of the loss of those activities.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, the mice were reported to be otherwise phenotypically normal, and their general metabolic state, as mirrored by serum electrolytes and glucose levels, was similar to that of the wild-type littermates at 14-15 wk of age.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In addition, the mice were fertile; thus the pharmacological effects previously reported on reproductive hormone (8, 26, 28, 39) and growth hormone (8) secretion did not appear to have a physiological expression in these animals at the times studied.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	41	Although the embryonic orexin gene knockout mice provided the key evidence that the pharmacological effects of orexin on sleep/wakefulness had potential physiological relevance and drew the attention of most investigators away from the endocrine and metabolic effects of the peptides, that model did not entirely recapitulate the pathology of human narcolepsy (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	42	 On the contrary, it had been recognized that human narcolepsy was in almost all cases not a frank lack of orexin gene expression throughout life, but instead a gradual loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus with aging (24, 40).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Thus to faithfully recreate the mouse equivalent of the human model, Yanagisawa and colleagues (Hara et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	44	 9), in yet another brilliant series of experiments, created mice harboring the toxic ataxin-3 gene attached to the orexin promotor.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The ataxin-3 gene encodes a protein with extended polyglutamine repeats that caused apoptosis when expressed in transfected cells in vitro (46).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Already by 2 wk of age, the expression of the transgene could be detected in orexin-producing neurons, and by 4-8 wk of age, the majority of the orexin-producing neurons had been eliminated.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Similarly, by 8 wk of age in the ataxin-3-transgenic mice, no preproorexin mRNA could be detected, whereas the expression of two other peptides known to be involved in the control of feeding, NPY and melanin-concentrating hormone, appeared normal (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	48	By 6 wk of age, the orexin/ataxin-3 mice (9) were observed to display periods of behavioral arrest similar to those previously reported by these investigators in the orexin-knockout animals (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness characteristic of the orexin-knockout animals was also observed in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This included increased frequency of entry into and duration of REM sleep.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Thus these mice, because of the delayed onset of compromise of orexin-producing neurons, more faithfully mirrored the situation in human narcolepsy, which is characterized by a slowly progressive disease due to the "dropping out" of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (40).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	52	The appearance of the alterations in sleep/wakefulness in these mice was predictable; however, additional observations made by this group of investigators were not, and these surprises provide important insight into the potential endocrine and metabolic actions of the endogenous orexins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	53	 One might have expected that, as these orexin/ataxin-3 mice aged, they would lose weight compared with wild-type controls due to the loss of the orexigenic action of the peptides.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Instead, even with a predicted decrease in food intake, they became obese (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The obese phenotype might have been due to the fact that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice displayed decreased spontaneous motor activity during the dark phase compared with controls, and thus their energy expenditure might possibly have been less, leading to obesity.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This would suggest that the ability of exogenous peptide to stimulate arousal and sympathetic nervous system and locomotor activity (3, 8, 30, 36) in the earlier pharmacological studies had physiological correlates.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	57	A most intriguing finding reported by Hara et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	58	 (9) was that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice developed, along with obesity, what appeared to be late-onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Earlier work in the preproorexin gene knockout animals had not suggested any alterations in glucose homeostasis, and there are no reports of direct effects of orexin on insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets or -cells themselves.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	60	 There is one report that intravenous administration of orexin elevates circulating insulin and glucose levels in rats, and that orexin A stimulates insulin release in vitro from isolated, perfused pancreas preparations (23), but then only at doses higher than those present in the gland or the circulation.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The observed phenotype of obesity and diabetes in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice resembles the situation in some human narcoleptic patients (10, 35).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It also mirrors the situation in cortisol excess, in which the obesity is the result of a combination of fat redistribution, due to altered insulin sensitivity, and increased appetite.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	63	 It is our hypothesis that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice represent exactly the same pathology.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	64	Central administration of orexin in conscious rats resulted in a behavioral response similar to the stress response (8, 30).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This included increased grooming and motor activity (e.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	66	 These injections also resulted in increased sympathetic nervous system tone, reflected by increased heart rate and blood pressure (3, 30, 36).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	67	 It is not known whether the orexin/ataxin-3 mice display a "reset" or depressed autonomic system, and it will be important to examine that possibility.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Similarly, central administration of orexin stimulated corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone release (8, 12, 14, 34) in vivo, an action that was blocked by pretreatment of the animals with a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist (12, 34).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	69	 CRF is a recognized anorexigenic/anxiogenic peptide (8), and the loss of orexin neurons might predict not only a decrease in CRF release into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal vessels in response to stress but also the loss of a potential stimulatory action of orexin on CRF neurons important in the "shut-off" of feeding cues.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Thus, in the absence of orexin, less CRF would be released under basal and stimulated conditions, and the animal, in addition to feeding for longer periods, would become corticosterone deficient.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Instead, quite the opposite was observed.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The animals ate less and appeared to experience corticosterone excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The decreased feeding observed clearly might be due to the loss of the orexigenic drive provided by the endogenous peptide, but what might explain the apparent corticosterone excess?.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	74	We have thought that the ability of centrally administered orexin to stimulate ACTH and corticosterone release in vivo (8, 12, 14, 34) was a reflection of a generalized stress effect of the exogenous peptide (30, 36) and not an indication of the role of endogenous orexin in the day-to-day control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Instead, we have identified direct anterior pituitary effects of the orexins/hypocretins (32) that potentially explain the metabolic phenotype of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Orexin-immunopositive nerve terminals exist in the external lamina of the median eminence (4), the site of diffusion of neuroendocrine factors into the hypophysial-portal vessels connecting the hypothalamus with the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In addition, both of the OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist in the anterior lobe, and the OX1R has been localized to corticotrophs in the human gland (1).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	78	 We have demonstrated the significant inhibitory effect of the orexins on CRF-stimulated ACTH release from cultured, anterior pituitary cells (32).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The effect appeared to be mediated by the OX1R subtype and a PKC-dependent mechanism, suggesting activation of a Gq-initiated signaling pathway (32).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	80	 More recently, we have demonstrated that orexin stimulated transient elevations in intracellular inositol trisphosphate levels (33), and Ferguson and Samson (A.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Samson, unpublished observations) have observed calcium transients in fura 2-labeled, CRF-responsive pituitary cells in vitro (A.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Samson, unpublished observations).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This would suggest that binding of orexin to the OX1R on corticotrophs results in activation of phospholipase C, with subsequent formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Because we have blocked the inhibitory action of orexin on CRF-induced ACTH release with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, we hypothesize that the formation of DAG results in the activation of a potassium channel, resulting in hyperpolarization of the corticotroph and a "right shift" in the CRF concentration-response curve.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This hypothesis is supported by our demonstration that pretreatment of the cells with a concentration of the potassium channel inhibitor glyburide, which by itself did not alter basal or CRF-stimulated hormone release, resulted in a complete reversal of the inhibitory effects of orexin (33).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	86	Thus we hypothesize that the more significant, physiologically relevant effect of orexin on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis is exerted at the pituitary and not the hypothalamic level.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The loss of a physiologically relevant, inhibitory effect of peptide over time as the orexin neurons degenerate would lead to increased sensitivity of the corticotrophs to CRF, with the resultant resetting of corticosteroid release and apparent corticosteroid excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This then might explain the appearance of diabetes to be in reality a situation of decreased insulin sensitivity caused by the corticosterone excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Certainly the obese appearance of these mice would support such a hypothesis.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	90	The absence of readily available, selective OX1R and OX2R antagonists and the inherent problems encountered with passive immunoneutralization approaches have resulted in slow progress toward the goal of establishing the physiological relevance of the described pharmacological actions of the orexins on endocrine systems and metabolism.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, observations from the study of the preproorexin gene knockout mice suggested that several of the observed endocrine actions of pharmacologically administered orexin were, in all likelihood, without physiological correlate.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Those mice were fertile and apparently grew normally, with the exception that they had decreased activity and food intakes, in addition to the alterations in sleep/wakefulness.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus previously described effects of exogenous peptide on reproductive hormone and growth hormone secretion were not reflected in these knockout mice (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Metabolic alterations were recognized, however.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	95	 When animals expressing the orexin/ataxin-3 gene product were followed into adulthood, a clearer picture of the physiological relevance of the pharmacological effects of exogenously administered orexin began to appear.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	96	 These mice are narcoleptic and display decreased motor activity (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In addition, they are obese and diabetic.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The model will certainly provide additional insight into the control of sleep/wakefulness, but even more importantly, it may provide information on the genesis of some forms of insulin-resistant diabetes, in particular those associated with excess corticosteroid production, e.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This may also stimulate clinical researchers to examine the possibility that a subset of human narcoleptic individuals are cushingoid.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Finally, these mice will provide a model in which to examine the unique, concordant actions of the peptides on feeding and energy utilization, which in the case of orexin, unlike those of other orexigenic peptides (9, 18), are positive for both food intake and energy expenditure.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It is caused by the progressive loss of hypocretin neurons in the brain (28, 31).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Hypocretin neuronal cell bodies are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area (41), but axonal projections throughout the central nervous system predict diverse biological actions (7).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Indeed, hypocretin peptides 1 and 2 (also called orexin A and B) appear to affect feeding behavior and energy expenditure, arousal, autonomic outflow, and a variety of neuroendocrine ensembles (9, 10, 43, 49).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Therefore, apart from its well-recognized neurological manifestations, the clinical syndrome of hypocretin deficiency in humans may encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic anomalies.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In keeping with this postulate, we recently identified aberrations of the pituitary-adrenal and somatotropic ensembles and circulating leptin concentrations in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men (15, 17, 29).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	10	The septal preoptic and arcuate nuclei are among the many brain sites receiving hypocretin inputs (7, 26, 32, 46).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These nuclei are involved in the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (50).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretins acutely induces LH release in ovarian-steroid-primed ovariectomized rats (37).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Also, hypocretin-1 promotes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in hypothalamic explants from male rats (40), and intracerebroventricular administration of anti-hypocretin antibody completely abolishes the preovulatory LH surge in intact female rats (14).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus the available data suggest that endogenous hypocretin peptides stimulate LH release in rodents.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is currently unknown whether these peptides exert analogous effects in humans.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	16	 As far as we are aware, the impact of hypocretins on FSH secretion has not been investigated to date.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	17	The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of endogenous hypocretins in the regulation of gonadotropin release in the human.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We specifically hypothesized that hypocretin deficiency in narcoleptic men would blunt spontaneous pituitary LH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	19	We included seven male patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology, Leiden University.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Also, the result of a multiple sleep latency test was typical for narcolepsy in all patients (23).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, all patients were HLA-DR2/DQB1*0602 positive (22) and lacked hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid [measurements as previously described (28)].
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All subjects were free of medication or (3 patients) had discontinued medication for 2 wk before the study.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Two of these three narcoleptic subjects had used psychostimulants (methylfenidate and modafinil) and one a tricyclic antidepressant (clomipramine).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	25	Weight and height of the subjects were measured, as well as waist and hip circumference.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was used as a relative measure of abdominal fat mass.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Total body fat mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR4500, Waltham, MA).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Seven male control subjects were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Controls were matched for age, body mass index, total fat mass, and WHR, since narcoleptics are (moderately) obese (16).

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	43	On a separate occasion, blood was drawn at 0800 after an overnight fast for measurement of LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Subsequently, a GnRH test was performed (42), whereby 100  microg of gonadoreline (Aventis Pharma, Hoevelaken, Netherlands) were given as an intravenous bolus, and serum LH concentrations were measured every 10 min for 90 min thereafter.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	45	Serum LH and FSH concentrations were measured with time-resolved immunofluorometric assays (Wallac, Turku, Finland), with coefficients of variation (CV) of 3.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	50	 SHBG was measured with an immunoradiometric assay (Spectria, Espoo, Finland) and serum estradiol with an RIA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratory, Webster, TX).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	51	 All samples of each gonadotropin 24-h profile were processed in the same assay procedure.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In addition, the leptin concentration was measured in every 20-min sample by RIA (Linco Research, St.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The detection limit of the assay was 0.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	54	3% in the concentration range of 4.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Details on leptin secretion in narcolepsy were previously published, but here we report only the 24-h mean leptin concentration in relation to LH parameters and testosterone (15).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Deconvolution analysis (47) was used to estimate the four secretory and clearance measures of interest: 1) the number and locations of secretory events; 2) the amplitudes of secretory bursts; 3) the durations of randomly dispersed LH and FSH secretory bursts; and 4) the endogenous single-component, subject-specific plasma half-lives of LH and FSH.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	57	 It was assumed that the gonadotropin distribution volumes and LH and FSH half-lives were time and concentration invariant.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The following parameters were calculated: half-duration of secretory bursts (duration of the secretory burst at half-maximal amplitude), hormone half-life, burst frequency, amplitude of the secretory burst (maximal secretory rate attained within a burst), mass secreted per burst, basal secretion rate (only for LH), pulsatile secretion rate (product of burst frequency and mean burst mass) and total secretion (sum of basal and pulsatile).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Based on recent validation studies in men, deconvolution analysis was carried out at 95% joint statistical confidence intervals for all calculated LH and FSH amplitudes (13, 25).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The univariate approximate entropy (ApEn) statistic was developed to quantify the degree of irregularity, or disorderliness, of a time series (33).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Technically, ApEn quantifies the summed logarithmic likelihood that templates (of length m) of patterns in the data that are similar (within r) remain similar (within the same tolerance r) on next incremental comparison and has been formally defined elsewhere (34).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The ApEn calculation provides a single nonnegative number, which is an ensemble estimate of relative process randomness, wherein larger ApEn values denote greater irregularity.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Cross-ApEn (X-ApEn) quantifies joint pattern synchrony between two separate but parallel time series after standardization (z-score transformation) (36, 38).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In the present analysis, we calculated X-ApEn assuming r = 20% of the SD of the individual time-series and m = 1; hence, use of the designation X-ApEn (1, 20%).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This parameter set affords sensitive, valid, and statistically well-replicated ApEn and X-ApEn metrics for assessing hormone time series of this length (35, 36).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Both ApEn and X-ApEn results are reported as the ratio of the absolute value to that of the mean of 1,000 randomly shuffled data series, values approaching 1.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Student's one-tailed t-test was used to evaluate the a priori hypothesis that LH secretion is reduced in narcoleptic men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	69	 All other comparisons were statistically evaluated by two-tailed Student's t-test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for two samples, where appropriate.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	124	These data suggest that endogenous hypocretin peptides stimulate pulsatile LH release in men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In particular, the fact that spontaneous LH secretion is blunted, whereas pituitary responsiveness to GnRH stimulation is intact in narcoleptic subjects, suggests that hypocretin deficiency primarily inhibits hypothalamic GnRH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This inference agrees with studies in male rats showing that hypocretin-1 promotes GnRH release from hypothalamic explants (40).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Moreover, hypocretin inputs are abundant in the preoptic area that contains many GnRH neurons (50), which coexpress hypocretin-1 receptors and are in direct contact with hypocretin fibers (3).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	128	 These physiological and anatomical observations obviously support the notion that hypocretin peptides are involved in the regulation of GnRH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The fact that FSH secretion is not diminished (whereas LH release is) in narcoleptic subjects may imply that hypocretins specifically modulate GnRH burst frequency, as LH secretion is particularly enhanced by high-frequency bursts, whereas low-frequency bursts predominantly promote FSH release (20).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	130	ApEn quantitates the relative orderliness or reproducibility of subordinate (nonpulsatile) secretory patterns in neurohormone time series and reflects feedforward and feedback adjustments driven by (patho)physiological changes in interglandular communication.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In view of the unchanged testosterone feedback signal in the patients, the increased LH and FSH regularity and increased synchrony of both hormones might reflect a diminished GnRH input signal with unchanged pituitary responsiveness toward this neurohormone (48).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	132	Alternatively, hypoleptinemia may blunt LH release in narcoleptic patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	133	 We have previously shown (15) that the plasma leptin concentration is considerably reduced in narcoleptic men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Leptin has emerged as an important modulator of the HPG axis (5).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Indeed, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are hypogonadotropic and sterile, and recombinant leptin administration rescues these defects in ob/ob males (24) and females (6).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Moreover, the circadian rhythm of plasma leptin levels is synchronous with that of LH concentrations (18), and the reduction of LH secretion induced by fasting in the rat and in humans can be reversed by leptin administration (1, 4, 8).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	137	 These data indicate that leptin stimulates LH release and that genetic and/or physiological alterations of circulating leptin levels can impact pituitary gonadotropin release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In this context, it is conceivable that the reduction of the plasma leptin concentration in narcoleptics (15) is involved in the diminution of pituitary LH release in these patients, but it should be mentioned that we could not demonstrate a (linear) correlation between mean circulating leptin concentration and LH production.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	139	Notwithstanding the diminished LH production, testosterone concentration was unchanged in patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Recently, it has become clear that leptin is involved in the (local) regulation of testosterone synthesis and secretion in the male rat gonad (44).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Direct evidence for such action in humans is not available, but an inverse relation between serum testosterone and leptin has been demonstrated (19).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Therefore, the inhibitory effect of leptin on testosterone (and adrenal hormone) secretion might be relevant in narcoleptic patients, because narcoleptics exhibit a 50% reduction in circulating leptin concentration, which may unleash gonadal testosterone secretion to compensate for diminished LH drive (15).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The finding of an inverse relationship between testosterone and leptin in our subjects reinforces this view.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	144	Prepro-orexin mRNA and the orexin receptors are expressed in various endocrine and nonendocrine tissues (11), and, for instance, orexins can modulate directly human and porcine adrenal stereoidogenic function (21, 27).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Relevant for the present investigation was the recent finding of the mRNA expression of the OX1 but not of the OX2 receptor in the male rat gonad (2).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Activation of the OX1 receptor stimulates testosterone secretion, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a physiological (modulating) role of the orexin system in concert with leptin and ghrelin at the testicular level (45).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The significance of these findings for human physiology needs to be explored.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	148	 However, OX1 and OX2 receptor expression was demonstrated in the male human reproductive system, including the testis, suggesting that orexins can directly impact gonadal hormone release in humans as well as in rodents (12).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	149	The impact of the alterations in the HPG ensemble described here on the fertility of narcoleptic men remains to be definitely determined.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Some early reports have suggested that narcolepsy is associated with impaired fertility (39), but since then these suggestions have not been confirmed, as far as we are aware.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Moreover, it is not our clinical impression that narcoleptic (male) patients are less fertile, and gonadal hormone concentrations in plasma were normal in narcoleptics despite the reduction of LH levels.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Thus it seems unlikely that the partial hypogonadotropism observed here has clinical sequelae.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Nevertheless, in view of our findings in males, it is warranted to investigate narcoleptic females across the menstrual cycle for putative defects in ovarian function.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	154	In conclusion, hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men have reduced circulating LH levels, which are brought about by a diminution of pulsatile LH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In contrast, FSH secretion is normal in these patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The pituitary sensitivity to GnRH stimulation is normal in narcoleptics, which suggests that a reduction of hypothalamic GnRH release underlies their blunted LH secretion, and in accordance with this view is the increased orderliness of secretion of gonadotropins.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Both hypocretin deficiency per se and hypoleptinemia may be involved in changes in the HPG axis in narcoleptic males.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	2	Recent advances in genomics open up new avenues in the analysis of complex behaviors such as sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	3	 In this analysis, the mouse is the model species of choice because it is amenable to high throughput phenotype and genotype analysis.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	9	WHY WE SLEEP IS A LONG-STANDING question that modern neuroscience is still unable to answer.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different aspects of sleep physiology.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We now know most of the neuronal substrates, neurochemical messengers, and regulatory processes involved in initiating and maintaining sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	12	 How can we further our understanding of sleep toward its function? Can molecular genetics bring new insights? Here, we first give a historical perspective on the genetics of sleep and then continue to review the available methods for the genetic dissection of sleep as an experimental approach that can be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art electrophysiological, neuroanatomic, and pharmacological techniques already used with great success in sleep research.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We also caution against making premature interpretations of molecular findings of complex traits that should only be attempted within the general physiology of an intact organism.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	14	Before the introduction of molecular biology, genetic studies of traits or phenotypes was based on either the observation of a resemblance between related individuals or crossing experiments between experimental individuals carrying divergent phenotypes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Simple laws have been discovered, according to which simple monogenic autosomal or recessive phenotypes segregate and are inherited on the basis of the assumptions of their molecular substrates, i.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, these types of traits are far less prevalent than those that cannot be attributed to the influence of single genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Nevertheless, shortly after the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG), Vogel (82) was one of the first to notice that even a complex phenotype like the EEG is under strong genetic control.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Segregation analysis in pedigrees carrying rare EEG variants was concordant with classical genetic laws, suggesting the presence of single gene effects (83-85).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Results from twin studies also indicated that the EEG patterns of monozygotic (MZ) twins have a much higher resemblance than those of dizygotic (DZ) twins or unrelated subjects (33, 82, 92), again confirming that this highly complex functional brain phenotype might be tightly controlled by genes and little (if any) affected by environment.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	20	The study of the genetics of sleep can be approximately dated back to a publication by Geyer in 1937 (26) in which he reported on a higher concordance between sleep habits of MZ twins than DZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Gedda (23) reported rare cases of concordant long sleepers (up to 15 h) in MZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Gedda and Brenci (24) first estimated that the heritability (percentage of variance explained by the additive effects of genes) of sleep duration is over 30%.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These authors later confirmed that sleep duration is highly similar in twins living apart (25), discounting the influence of possible environmental effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	24	 More recent observations in twins indicated that even the pattern of rapid eye movements present higher concordance between MZ than between DZ twins (8) and that between 40 and 50% of the variance in sleep duration and the presence of a sleep disorder can be accounted for by genetic effects (30, 50).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Zung and Wilson (94) performed the first polygraphic sleep recordings in twins in 1966; they found the temporal sequence of sleep stages to be almost completely concordant between MZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Between 1983 and 1998, detailed polygraphic analyses were performed in twins; all of these studies reported surprising similarities between MZ twins (31, 39-41, 87).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Experimental genetics of sleep in mice was pioneered by Valatx in the early 1970s.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Over a time span of 15 years, Valatx's group (72-77) conducted several crossing experiments and recorded sleep in hundreds of inbred, recombinant inbred (RI), and hybrid mice, mainly to follow the segregation of paradoxical sleep (PS) amount.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These studies, together with a diallelique (reciprocal crossing between several inbred strains) sleep experiment in mice performed by Friedmann (22), clearly indicated that, although some aspects of sleep may follow a simple segregation, the classical genetic laws cannot predict most others.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	30	Although these now classical genetic sleep studies favor a strong genetic basis for sleep, we still have no clue about possible molecular mechanisms.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The first attempts to identify the molecular basis of sleep have been based on the assumption that there must be genes that change their expression according to the behavioral state (sleep vs.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	32	 wake) and/or time spent in a particular state.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Closely related examples come from the circadian field where dramatic changes in the expression of several clock genes occur according to a strict circadian pattern (reviewed in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The two-process model of sleep regulation (10), by its remarkable predictions on the homeostatic aspects of sleep, motivated the first molecular investigation of sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Because sleep need and intensity are homeostatically regulated, deprivation of sleep should lead to a change in the expression of those genes, of which the product(s) is necessary for recovery or is (at least) involved in sleep regulation.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	36	 (54) performed the first substractive hybridization in sleep-deprived vs.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	37	 control rats and isolated several clones with increased or decreased relative expression, among which neurogranin and dendrin were later identified (47-48).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The sleep-deprivation paradigm has since become the method of choice in gene expression experiments aimed at uncovering molecular bases of sleep regulatory processes (reviewed in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Our laboratory (56) has already discussed several conceptual problems of this approach.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In summary, there are two major limitations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	41	 First is the fact that the expression of many genes varies with vigilance state rather than themselves being actively involved in vigilance state regulation.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This weakness of correlative gene expression can only be overcome by confirming the involvement of the identified genes by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Second, the very high complexity of mammalian brain mRNA populations is a technical limitation; however, this can be overcome by recent developments in gene expression profiling (see below).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Nevertheless, the identification of cortistatin and orexin (12, 13) with specific actions on sleep shows that gene expression investigation can be highly successful.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	45	Transgenic methods based on random gene integration and homologous recombination gave rise to a strong hope to uncover the molecular bases of many phenotypes, including the most complex ones.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These techniques can be used to address the consequences of overexpression, ectopic expression, time- and tissue-specific expression, and gain or loss of function of a candidate gene.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	48	 With the exception of the orexin/hypocretin system (see below), to the best of our knowledge not a single gene manipulation has been performed specifically to investigate its consequences on sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	49	 However, many investigators in the field benefit from the availability of such transgenic models to answer sleep-related questions.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The accumulated results indicate that all transgenic mice studies published thus far (see Table 1) report some sleep-related abnormalities, strongly suggesting either the nonspecific effects of gene manipulations and/or the complex integrative nature of sleep that makes it highly sensitive to many physiological changes.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	53	The most straightforward approach is to consider a candidate gene based on previous evidence of its implication in sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	54	 As indicated above, sleep physiology and pharmacology studies have identified most of the essential systems from which candidate genes can be chosen.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	55	 With the use of this approach, studies of the differential expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (53), growth hormone-releasing hormone (6), interleukin-1 (43), somatostatin (63), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (5) have shown that all of these play a potential role in sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Sleep studies in transgenic mice (Table 1) have also used this approach.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	57	 This powerful approach can also be combined with more recent techniques for gene identification.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The major disadvantage of this approach is that obviously nothing new can be learned in terms of sleep gene discovery.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	59	A unique "coincidental" sleep-related gene discovery concerns the orexin system.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic neuropeptides acting on orexin 1 and 2 receptors and first thought to be involved in feeding behavior (13, 55).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Mignot's group (38) identified, through linkage analysis and positional cloning, mutations in the orexin 2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy, an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Independently and almost simultaneously, Yanagisawa's group (7), who were interested in the role of orexins in feeding behavior, discovered in the mouse a phenotype similar to canine and human narcolepsy after a targeted deletion of the preproorexin gene.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	63	 More recently, the orexin system has also been implicated in the etiology of human narcolepsy; narcoleptic patients have undetectable orexin A levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (49), and in a small number of postmortem cases a dramatic reduction in the number of orexin-containing neurons was observed in the hypothalamus (51, 65).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	64	 These unexpected observations led Sakurai's group (29) to generate the first transgenic mice to specifically investigate the role of the orexin system in vigilance states.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These transgenic mice carry the promoter of the human preproorexin gene ligated to a truncated human ataxin-3, a gene that can induce cell death.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The specific expression of this transgene construct in orexin-containing neurons induces apoptosis between 4 and 15 wk of age.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Adult orexin/ataxin-3 mice show narcolepsy, hypophagia, and obesity (29).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	68	 However, although the causal implication of the orexin system in narcolepsy is now established, its direct and causal involvement in normal sleep regulation, as is often claimed (3, 14, 28, 34, 64, 89, 91), remains to be elucidated.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	69	The systematic search for genes affecting a particular phenotype needs to cover the whole genome of an organism.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The genome-wide search or mapping experiments make no a priori assumptions on gene systems involved; although this approach may lead to already known physiological mechanisms, its strength is that unknown and/or unexpected systems may be discovered.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The orexin success story in canine narcolepsy is the unique and the best example of this approach in the field of sleep research.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Therefore, genome-wide search constitutes the method of choice if we are to discover new "sleep genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	73	The fundamental basis of this approach is the linkage disequilibrium between closely localized genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	74	 If a gene is affecting a trait, there must be in addition to this gene other genetic material tightly linked to it and segregating from generation to generation together with the trait under study.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Therefore, instead of testing all genes of an organism to check for cosegregation with a trait (linkage), one needs to test only a small panel of genes at regular intervals throughout the genome to obtain sufficient information on the large chromosomal pieces that are transmitted as a single unit.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To follow the segregation of genes, they must be polymorphic (nucleotide variation from individual to individual); this may not be the case, or the sequence of the gene may be unknown.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	77	 A powerful substitute is provided by highly polymorphic elements (restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLPs, simple sequence length polymorphisms or SSLPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, and so forth), mostly found in the noncoding genetic material.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The more polymorphic markers are tested, the more accurate the mapping will be.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	79	 A major question is how big the effect of a gene should be to be detected.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	80	, orexin 2 receptor) can produce remarkable changes in a trait that is readily recognized (e.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	81	, the monogenic autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy), whereas natural variations in genes controlling complex traits may have only subtle effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Therefore, genome-wide approaches to dissect complex traits should be highly sensitive to detect all genes with variable effects on the trait.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	83	Basically, two major approaches are available: mutagenesis and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The mutagenesis approach is straightforward: a mutagen like N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea is used to mutate at random the whole genome; this is followed by high-throughput screening of all mutant offspring to detect a major effect on a given phenotype.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Both dominant and recessive mutations can be screened in the same way as a single gene mutation in a pathological condition.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Once the mutated gene is localized, candidate gene or positional cloning approaches are used for its identification, and ultimately its functional analysis can be performed by gain or loss of function.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The remarkable demonstration of this technique is provided by the isolation of Clock, one of the key mammalian circadian clock genes (1, 35, 81).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, genetic screens in this approach are for fully penetrant dominant and recessive mutations and therefore cannot identify small-effect sequence variations that may turn out to be essential for some aspects of the phenotype.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition, with currently available technologies, recording and analyzing sleep of thousands of mice in a mutant screen does not seem feasible, at least not in a single academic laboratory.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	90	 QTL analysis has been proposed as a powerful approach in the genetic dissection of complex traits (11, 17, 36).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Although natural allelic variation of genes with small effect can be mapped through QTL analysis, the final identification of sequence variants (quantitative trait nucleotides or QTNs; Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	92	 42) in the QTL region with biologically significant effects on the phenotype may represent prohibitive efforts in terms of both phenotyping and genotyping.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	93	 An excellent example of how QTL analysis can further our understanding of complex traits was recently provided by Takahashi's group (57) for the circadian behavior in mice.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Although most of the molecular machinery of the circadian timekeeping system has been discovered mainly by direct molecular techniques and mutagenesis, the identified genes do not explain the complexity of the observed circadian behavior.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	95	 For instance, none of the clock genes has been found to be involved in the approximately 1-h difference in free-running period between BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Takahashi's group (57) used QTL analysis in a BALB/c  x  C57BL/6 (CXB) intercross and discovered several new loci with epistatic interaction.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	97	The complex nature of sleep is reflected in high intra- and interspecies phenotypic variability.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	98	 For instance, the 24-h amount of sleep shows highly significant differences between inbred mouse strains (21, 22, 74).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	99	 We have shown that AKR mice sleep ~3 h more than DBA mice over a 24-h period (21).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	100	 As for the differences in the period of circadian rhythms, not a single gene but many genes with complex interactions may be found to account for this difference.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	101	 We therefore initiated a series of experiments to dissect different phenotypic aspects of sleep in mice through QTL analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Table 2 summarizes the main quantitative aspects of sleep for those inbred strains of mice that differed the most.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Note that most differences between high and low strains are consistent between the two studies performed 25 years apart (usually, differences between two extreme strains expressed in standard deviations are twice as large in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	104	 74 due to smaller within-strain standard deviations based on repeated measures; this is because data in Ref.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	108	QTL analysis can be performed in several segregating mouse populations, including intercross and backcross, advanced intercross and backcross, RI, and heterogeneous stocks (11, 63).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Basically, two inbred mouse strains differing in the trait of interest are crossed and their F1 offspring are either intercrossed to generate F2 or backcrossed to one of the progenitor strains to generate backcross populations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Further random intercross or backcross generations can be performed to generate advanced intercross and backcross populations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	111	 To generate RI sets, F2 mice are brother  x  sister mated until full homozygosity, thereby "fixing" unique sets of recombinations in several inbred lines.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Heterogeneous stocks are generated by intercrossing several inbred mouse strains over many generations and therefore represent higher rates of recombination and polymorphism useful for fine mapping (44, 63).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Although RIs are usually not suitable for QTL mapping due to their limited progenitor strains and number, for QTLs of large effects, they may provide significant mapping accuracy because of the fourfold increase in recombination compared with a F2 population (11).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Also, for complex phenotypes with high variability, the use of RIs is advantageous because several individuals per strain are tested instead of, for example, a single F2 animal.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Therefore, as a first step, we have performed QTL analysis in two RI sets.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In seven CXB RIs, QTLs were identified for the amount of PS on chromosomes 5, 7, 12, and 17 (61).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Toth and Williams (71) conducted a similar study in 13 CXB RIs and reported provisional QTLs on chromosomes 4, 16, and 17 for the amount of PS during the light period.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Because of a small number of CXB RIs (n = 7-13), none of the QTLs identified could satisfy standard significance levels (37).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Also, the discrepancy between the two referenced works indicates that, as in any linkage study, replication is needed, especially when the findings are based on a limited number of animals and/or strains (for a recent review, see also Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	120	 QTL analysis in 25 C57BL/6  x  DBA/2 (BXD) RIs identified the first significant QTL for the amount of PS in the 12-h light period on chromosome 1 (60).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	121	 We have estimated in BXD RIs that between 40 and 60% of variance in sleep amounts can be accounted for by the additive effects of 6-15 genes, confirming a polygenic basis for differences in sleep amounts.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	122	Quantitative EEG analysis by means of fast Fourier transform analysis is a robust technique to evaluate functional changes of the central nervous system, including changes in vigilance states (2).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Slow-wave sleep is characterized by oscillations in the delta (1-4 Hz) and spindle (11-15 Hz) frequency ranges, whereas PS, especially in rodents, is characterized by theta oscillations (5-9 Hz).

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Waking EEG analysis in twins demonstrated that spectral profiles are among the most heritable traits in humans (reviewed in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	126	 79), with heritability estimates ranging from 75 to 90% (80).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We have shown that several spectral characteristics of sleep (Fig.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Among these, the theta peak frequency during PS showed the highest difference between inbred strains, and 80% of interstrain variability could be attributed to genetic effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We have established in intercross and backcross CXB mice that a single gene may explain most of this phenotypic variance (a major gene) (62).

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	142	Another aspect of the sleep EEG, with considerable importance for its homeostatic regulation, is the change in delta power (i.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	143	, EEG power in the 1- to 4-Hz range) as a function of the prior wakefulness duration.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Relative delta power can be used to index both sleep need and sleep intensity in all mammalian species studied so far.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Sleep loss induces a proportional and predictable increase in delta power, which differs significantly between inbred mouse strains (18, 21).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We have used the delta power rebound after a 6-h sleep deprivation to map the underlying genes in BXD RIs (18).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The results confirmed that the rate at which sleep need accumulates varies greatly with genotype.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	148	 One significant QTL was identified on chromosome 13 that accounted for 50% of genetic variance in this trait.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These two examples suggest that quantitative sleep EEG parameters are under stronger genetic control than sleep amounts; therefore, these are more suitable for quantitative genetic dissection.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Sleep amounts in mammals may be approximated by techniques other than EEG, such as the use of piezoelectric films, which would make a high-throughput genetic analysis feasible.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, success may be limited due to the highly polygenic nature of sleep amounts, suggesting the presence of many genes with small effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	152	 On the other hand, the quantitative EEG analysis dramatically limits its wide-range use (because this involves implantation, recovery, adaptation, cabling, and time-intensive analysis) but may turn out to be more successful due to the limited number of underlying genes and the presence of major genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	153	QTL analysis does not map a gene but a genetic effect in a large chromosomal region (usually between 20 and 30 cM).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These large regions may contain a single major gene or several genes with small effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Also, QTLs may interact with each other (epistasis), an effect that is difficult to detect in QTL mapping experiments.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The first step is to make sure that the region contains QTLs of large enough effect.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	157	 One possibility is to transfer the QTL region from one inbred strain background to another inbred background through repeated backcrossing and selection to make a congenic strain.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	158	 We have reviewed sleep amount data available in eight congenic strains generated by transferring minor histocompatibility genes from the inbred strain BALB/c to the inbred background of C57BL/6 (60).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In almost all cases, the results indicated that, even if the transferred pieces of chromosomes contained a large-effect QTL detected in CXB RIs, a clear effect could not be observed in the resulting congenic strain.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This finding strongly suggests that 1) many genes are involved, 2) they are in interaction (epistasis), and 3) even if a major QTL is identified, its effect may vary from genetic background to genetic background due to the action of modifier genes (45).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Once the QTL region is verified, the next step is to finely map the QTL down to the smallest chromosomal region (11, 17), amenable to candidate gene analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The final identification of functional QTNs (sequence variants) is the most difficult part, since QTNs may be found every few kilobases.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Therefore, a combination of several approaches is necessary for mapping and candidate gene analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	164	 High-resolution QTL mapping in conjunction with future developments in high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping and the availability of whole genome sequences of several major mouse strains should identify candidate genes to be investigated.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	165	 All of those candidate genes can then be mutated either by classical homologous recombination (knockout) or by the newly developed serial nested chromosomal deletions (59).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Systematic crosses between increasing and decreasing QTL allele and the complete set of mutants should physically identify the functional QTN.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Because most QTNs will probably be involved in gene regulation rather than being mutations affecting the protein function, further gene expression profiling with high-throughput genotyping technologies (e.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	168	, microarray or TaqMan) and gene translation and posttranslational protein analyses should be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Note that finding the molecular basis in a mutagenesis experiment follows approximately the same time- and labor-intensive procedure.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	170	The challenge of finding molecular bases of sleep requires demanding efforts, not only in terms of genetic and genomic resources but also in terms of future developments of high-throughput phenotyping techniques.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	171	 If enough effort and financial resources are given to develop simplified and automated sleep recording devices, this major limitation should be overcome.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	6	NARCOLEPSY IS A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypnagogic hallucinations, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis (41), which affects 20 to 60 of every 100,000 subjects in the US and Europe (32).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Disruption of hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission underlies the disease in animals and humans (28, 39).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Hypocretins (hypocretin-1 and -2, also called orexin A and B) are produced by a small group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which project widely throughout the central nervous system (CNS) (8, 56).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is among the various brain sites that receive hypocretin input signals (7).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This nucleus harbors neurons that synthesize thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis (24).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	11	 During starvation, thyroid hormone secretion is suppressed (2, 52), whereas preprohypocretin mRNA is upregulated in the lateral hypothalamus (4).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This led us to hypothesize that hypocretin neural circuits can modulate the activity of hypothalamic TRH neurons and thereby impact the HPT axis.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	13	Studies of the putative effects of hypocretin peptides on the HPT axis in animals have been incomplete, and results are conflicting.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	14	 A single intravenous or intracerebroventricular injection of hypocretin-1 in rats acutely decreased plasma TSH concentrations and hypothalamic TRH release (34).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In contrast, several other papers report that hypocretin-1 has no measurable effect on the pituitary thyroid axis (16, 20, 53, 54), whereas circulating TSH was shown to increase in response to central administration of hypocretin-2 (20).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, although the topography of hypocretin- and thyrotrope neural circuits suggests that TRH neuronal activity is governed by hypocretin input, the nature of the signal (i.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	17	, excitatory or inhibitory) remains unclear (where hypocretin-1 and -2 may have differential effects as a result of their distinct chemical structure).

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Because leptin has stimulatory effects on the HPT axis, it is conceivable that (relative) hypoleptinemia downregulates HPT axis activity in narcolepsy.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	162	 TRH is synthesized in the thyrotropic area of the PVN and in the anterior pituitary, where it acts to promote TSH secretion through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, respectively (58).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Although hypocretin neuronal cell bodies heavily project to the PVN (43), it is currently unknown whether hypocretin axons actually synapse with TRH neurons.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It is therefore uncertain whether hypocretins can directly modulate TRH synthesis and release and thus affect TSH secretion.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Also, experiments investigating the impact of (exogenous) hypocretin peptides on TSH release in rodents have yielded inconclusive results.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of hypocretin-1 either reduced plasma TSH levels or showed no effect on TSH and/or TRH release (16, 34, 53, 54).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Thus it seems unlikely that hypocretin deficiency per se inhibits TRH secretion to reduce TSH levels in narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	168	We (22) previously showed that circulating leptin levels are 50% lower in narcoleptic patients than in controls matched for age and body fat mass.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Here, we show that circulating leptin levels and TSH secretion rates are correlated positively in narcoleptic men.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Other studies have revealed that leptin is intimately involved in the regulation of the HPT axis.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Specifically, a reduction of circulating leptin mediates the inhibition of HPT axis activity during starvation (13).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Leptin acts primarily to integrate the activities of neuronal circuits that orchestrate energy balance (40).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In this context, leptin activates -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), whereas it inhibits neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	174	 TRH neurons receive functional inputs from all of these neurotransmitters (10 to 12, 25, 26, 57): NPY/AgRP inhibit TRH release (21), whereas -MSH/CART promote TRH secretion (11, 21).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In addition, leptin can directly stimulate prepro-TRH mRNA synthesis and processing and promote TRH release via activation of leptin receptors on TRH neurons (37).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Moreover, the fact that leptin and leptin receptors are expressed in rodent anterior pituitary cells suggests that leptin may also impact TSH secretion directly (19).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Diurnal pulsatile leptin and TSH levels exhibit strong pattern synchrony in healthy humans, whereas TSH release gets disorganized and its circadian rhythm phase shifted in leptin deficient human subjects (31).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In the present study, we also demonstrate strong pattern synchrony between leptin and TSH both in patients and in controls.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These data clearly suggest that leptin is involved in the regulation of TSH release in rodents and humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Thus the fact that TSH release rates were positively correlated with circulating leptin levels in the present study supports, but certainly does not prove, the contention that hypoleptinemia blunts TSH secretion in narcoleptic patients.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	181	Diminished dopaminergic tone may also blunt TSH secretion in narcoleptic subjects through diminution of TRH release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Studies using the canine model of narcolepsy suggest that hypoactivity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic circuits are among the major pathophysiological mechanisms in narcolepsy (38).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Recent in vivo brain imaging studies in humans support this notion (9), and the disease is currently treated symptomatically with drugs that enhance monoaminergic (i.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	184	, dopamine, norepinephrine) neurotransmissions (38).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In vitro and in vivo studies clearly show that hypocretin peptides stimulate dopaminergic neurons in various brain sites (16, 36), which also suggests that hypocretin deficiency may silence dopaminergic circuits.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Dopamine promotes TRH release via hypothalamic dopamine D2 receptors (27).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, hypocretin deficiency may blunt TRH (and thereby TSH) release through diminution of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the hypothalamus.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, the role of dopamine in the regulation of TSH secretion is complex, in view of the fact the this monoamine inhibits TSH release at the level of the pituitary (6, 14).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	189	 This observation implies that reduced dopaminergic tone would lead to an increase of circulating TSH in narcoleptic subjects.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In this context, it seems important to mention that prolactin secretion, which is also controlled by dopamine at the pituitary level, is not altered in narcoleptic patients (S.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Thus the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of low plasma TSH levels in narcoleptic humans remains uncertain.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	192	Other clinical features of narcolepsy also suggest that TRH deficiency [through hypoleptinemia or other (unknown) causes] may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	193	 EDS and cataplexy are reflections of depressed activity of the CNS.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Accordingly, the current options for treatment of narcolepsy include CNS stimulants for EDS and antidepressants for cataplexy (41).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	195	 TRH receptors are distributed widely in the CNS (15), and TRH has diverse neuromodulating actions (15, 48).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Among many other features, it has CNS-stimulant and -antidepressant effects (18, 29).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Interestingly, chronic administration of a TRH analog increases wakefulness and ameliorates cataplexy in narcoleptic dogs (50), which may imply that diminished TRH tone is involved in the pathogenesis of these narcoleptic symptoms.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	198	 However, the fact that circulating prolactin levels are normal in narcoleptic humans (unpublished observation) argues against (but does not exclude) a primary TRH deficiency in these patients, as TRH is involved in the regulation of prolactin release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	199	Sleep has an inhibitory effect on TSH release, as demonstrated in the human under a normal light-dark cycle and during sleep and light-dark cycle manipulations (1, 17).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms are not known.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In the present study, sleep and plasma TSH levels were inversely associated, and sleep periods were invariably followed by a reduction of TSH concentration in both patients and controls, suggesting that hypocretins are not involved in the coupling of sleep and TSH release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The present data also suggest that the fact that patients slept longer than controls may have contributed to the reduction of their TSH levels.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	203	Hypersensitivity of the thyroid gland to TSH stimulation may also contribute to the alterations of the pituitary thyroid ensemble described here.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Despite the fact that TSH levels were reduced in narcoleptic subjects, plasma T4 and T3 concentrations were similar to those in healthy controls and completely within the normal range.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This may imply that the thyroid is more sensitive to TSH stimulation in narcoleptics (unfortunately, our study does not yield further data to support this notion).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thyroid hypersensitivity to TSH may be brought about by the reduction of sympathetic tone in these patients (55), as TSH-induced T4 release is inhibited by 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation (30, 35).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This putative resetting of the pituitary-thyroid axis could fully explain our observations.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In any case, the fact that thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range in narcoleptics indicates that these patients are euthyroid.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, it remains to be established whether the ensemble acts appropriately under conditions of greater metabolic demands, such as growth, cold adaptation, or pregnancy.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	210	Our data clearly show that the ApEn statistic can appropriately detect disorderliness of sleep patterns in narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Thus it is conceivable that the application of ApEn analysis to sleep patterns and the effect of drug therapy in other sleep disorders and to physiological studies of sleep and related neuroendocrine phenomena might contribute to further understanding of the complicated networks involved.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	212	In conclusion, the present study shows that circulating TSH concentrations are reduced in the face of normal plasma thyroid hormone concentrations in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Hypoleptinemia and disorderly sleep episodes of longer duration may be involved in the pathophysiology of this neuroendocrine feature of narcolepsy.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	5	Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder caused by impaired hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Growth hormone (GH) secretion may be altered in narcolepsy for various reasons.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Slow-wave sleep episodes, which are closely associated with GH-secretory events, are more randomly dispersed over 24 h in narcoleptics.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, hypocretins may inhibit pituitary GH release.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We assessed the function of the somatotropic axis in narcolepsy by deconvolving 24-h (10-min sampling interval) plasma GH concentration profiles in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic patients and in seven healthy controls matched for age, sex, and body weight.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Both basal and pulsatile GH secretion rate and secretagogue-induced GH release were similar in patients and controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, narcoleptics secreted ~50% of their total production during the daytime, whereas controls secreted only 25% during the day.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Also, the GH output pattern of narcoleptics was significantly less regular.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We propose that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian distribution of hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone release in narcoleptic patients to simultaneously cause daytime GH release and promote their propensity to fall asleep during the day.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	14	NARCOLEPSY PRIMARILY AFFECTS the organization and regulation of sleep and wakefulness.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Its main symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and fragmented nocturnal sleep (20).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Narcolepsy is caused by disruption of hypocretin (orexin)-mediated neurotransmission (7, 16, 21).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The vast majority of human patients lack hypocretin in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17, 18, 28).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypocretin neurons is currently presumed to be the principal cause of narcolepsy in humans (21, 30).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	19	Sleep and the activity of the somatotropic axis are intimately related (33).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In particular, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is associated with pituitary growth hormone (GH) release.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In healthy individuals, a major GH-secretory event occurs often shortly after sleep onset, in close temporal association with the first period of SWS.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Conversely, sleep deprivation is consistently associated with a reduction of circulating GH levels, and the age-related decline of SWS is accompanied by a marked decrease of GH secretion (32).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	23	Because SWS episodes are more randomly distributed over 24 h in narcoleptic patients than in healthy subjects (5, 6), the circadian distribution of GH-secretory events may be altered in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, because intracerebroventricular injection of hypocretin-1 causes a dose-dependent reduction of plasma GH in rats (13), hypocretin deficiency may exert a direct excitatory effect on GH release in narcoleptics.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	25	Only a limited number of studies have assessed the status of the somatotropic axis in narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In general, these studies have suggested that the rise of plasma GH concentrations around sleep onset is markedly dampened or even absent in narcolepsy (2, 8, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It was hypothesized that an intrinsic disturbance of SWS and/or the frequent occurrence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods underlies these alterations in GH secretion in narcoleptic humans (33).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, the interpretation of data obtained in these early studies was hampered by methodological imperfections, particularly with respect to the selection of control subjects [e.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	29	, not matched for age and/or body mass index (BMI)].
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Moreover, in the course of time, novel analytical techniques [deconvolution and approximate entropy (ApEn)] have been developed, which allow estimation of the pituitary GH secretion rate and quantification of the orderliness of the release process on the basis of frequently sampled plasma GH concentration time series (24, 34, 38).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	31	To further evaluate the impact of a disturbance of circadian (slow-wave) sleep distribution and/or hypocretin deficiency on various features of pulsatile GH secretion in humans, we deconvolved 24-h plasma GH concentration profiles in narcoleptic patients and in healthy controls matched for age, sex, and BMI.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We specifically hypothesized that the circadian distribution of peaks and troughs of plasma GH concentrations would be disrupted and that the total daily GH production would be increased in narcoleptic patients.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We included seven male patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A physician experienced with narcolepsy (G.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Lammers) made the clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The diagnosis was confirmed by Multiple Sleep Latency Testing, which showed results typical for narcolepsy (1).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	37	 All patients were HLA-DQB1*0602 positive.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We confirmed that all patients were hypocretin deficient: hypocretin-1 was undetectable in the CSF with direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (28).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The subjects, except three (two using psychostimulants, and one using clomipramine), who discontinued their medication for 2 wk before the study, were free of medication.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	40	Weight and height of all subjects were measured, as well as waist and hip circumference (waist halfway between the lowest rib and crista iliaca, and hip as the maximum circumference in standing position).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was used as a relative measure of abdominal fat mass.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Total body fat mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR4500, Waltham, MA) (3).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	43	We recruited seven male control subjects through advertisements in local newspapers.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Controls were matched for age, BMI, total fat mass, and WHR.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Controls did not take any medication and had no history of sleep disorders.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	46	Subjects were eligible for the study after exclusion of hypertension (defined as a repeated blood pressure measurement showing systolic pressure of  > 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure of  > 90 mmHg), any known (history of) endocrine disease, recent weight change ( > 3 kg weight gain or loss within the last 3 mo), and a fasting blood glucose of  > 7.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	47	The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Serum IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations were measured only once in an early morning sample.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Serum GH concentrations were measured using a sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Turku, Finland).

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	71	 During the 24-h sampling procedure, sleep was recorded polygraphically using a Porti-5 ambulant electroencephalogram recording system (Twente Medical Systems International, Enschede, Netherlands) and scored on EEG-2100 review software (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	72	 An experienced technician, blinded for the subject under study, visually scored the sleep recordings at 30-s epochs by means of standardized criteria (27).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Nocturnal sleep onset was identified as the first epoch of stages II, III, IV, or REM sleep after lights off, provided that the subsequent interval was not scored as wake.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The sleep period was defined as the time between sleep onset and final awakening in the morning.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Sleep efficiency was calculated as the percentage of the sleep period actually spent asleep.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	76	 For the GH time series, we used multiple-parameter deconvolution analysis to estimate various specific measures of pulsatile secretion and half-life on the basis of simultaneous consideration of all serum hormone concentrations and their dose-dependent intrasample variances (35, 37).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Results are expressed as milliunits per liter of distribution volume (mU/lD).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The following parameters were estimated in the GH series: number of secretory bursts, secretory burst half-duration (duration at half-maximal amplitude), burst amplitude, mean mass secreted per burst, hormone half-life, pulsatile secretion rate, basal secretion rate, and total secretion per 24 h.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Furthermore, we quantified the amount of GH secreted from 0900 to 2300 and from 2300 to 0900 during the 3 h before and after sleep onset and during the first secretory burst after sleep onset.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	80	We quantified the minute-to-minute regularity ("serial orderliness") of GH secretion by use of the ApEn statistic, a scale- and model-independent metric (24).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	81	 ApEn estimates the regularity of subordinate (nonpulsatile) patterns in the data and as such yields information complementary to deconvolution techniques (25, 39).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Greater regularity yields smaller ApEn values, whereas greater independence among sequential values of a time series yields larger ApEn values.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	83	 We applied normalized ApEn parameters of m = 1 and r = 20% of the intraseries SD, as previously validated for GH series of this length (26).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The ApEn ratio delineates the orderliness of a concentration time series compared with the ApEn score associated with maximal randomness in the same time series as estimated by computer simulation.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Thus an ApEn ratio equal to 1 reflects maximal randomness in the time series under study, and smaller ApEn ratios denote greater regularity.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	86	GH release in response to GHRH injection was determined using deconvolution analysis (see above).

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The patients had several daytime naps, including SWS episodes, whereas sleep was confined to nighttime in controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Total daily GH production was strongly correlated with the total time of SWS in narcoleptic patients and controls alike (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As a result, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and (slow-wave) sleep epochs over 24 h was altered concomitantly in narcoleptics such that they secreted a larger fraction of their total GH production during the day (48 vs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The GH output pattern was significantly less regular in the narcoleptic patients.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Against expectations, both basal and pulsatile GH production and secretagogue-induced GH release were similar in patients and controls (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	151	Only a few previous studies have examined plasma GH concentrations in patients with narcolepsy.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The results of these studies generally suggested that GH release (both spontaneous 24-h and secretagogue-induced) is blunted in narcoleptics (2, 8, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	153	 However, interpretation of the data obtained in these studies is hampered by potential imperfections regarding the selection of control subjects.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	154	 For example, in two of the studies (2, 15), body weight of the participants was not reported, and a third study (8) did not include healthy control subjects at all.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We now know that narcoleptic patients tend to be obese (9) and that GH production is profoundly reduced in (abdominally) obese humans (23, 36).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Also, age was reported in only two studies (2, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In one of these (15), the narcoleptic patients were ~10 yr older than the controls (32 vs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	158	 24 yr), which may also have biased the results (32).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In the present study, the control subjects were carefully matched with respect to age, sex, BMI, and body fat distribution to preclude analogous bias.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Therefore, we believe that the data presented in the present paper are more conclusive than any previous study as to whether narcolepsy per se impacts GH secretion.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Moreover, the narcoleptic patients in the present study were confirmed to be hypocretin deficient, which was not possible to determine in any of the previous studies (as hypocretin peptides were unknown at that time).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Thus the present data pertain specifically to hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Our results clearly argue against a reduction of spontaneous or secretagogue-induced GH secretion in human narcolepsy.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	164	What can we learn about the regulation of GH secretion and sleep from the results of this study? First, the onset of nocturnal sleep remains an important correlate of GH release, even when numerous naps have interrupted daytime wakefulness.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Both in narcoleptics and in controls, ~30% of total daily GH secretion occurred in the 3 h after nocturnal sleep onset.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Second, the relationship between SWS and GH release remains robust, even if sleep is fragmented and more randomly dispersed over 24 h.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	167	 A strong, positive, and highly significant correlation between both variables was observed in narcoleptics and in controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Third, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and sleep epochs over 24 h appears to be altered analogously in narcoleptic patients: they had more (slow-wave) sleep time and more GH secretion during the day.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Finally, endogenous hypocretins do not significantly impact the amount of GH that is produced daily in humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	170	The hypocretin peptides (hypocretin-1 and -2, also known as orexin A and B) are produced exclusively by a small number of neurons located in the perifornical area of the hypothalamus (10, 29).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Hypocretin neurons connect with other nuclei within the hypothalamus (including the arcuate nucleus) and the pituitary (22) to explain their impact on energy balance and several neuroendocrine ensembles (for reviews, see Refs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 causes a dose-dependent decrease of plasma GH in rats (13).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Furthermore, it was recently reported that somatotropic cells in the human pituitary express the hypocretin receptor-1 (4).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These data suggest that hypocretins directly blunt GH secretion.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	175	 We therefore hypothesized that hypocretin deficiency would enhance total daily GH production in narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Our results do not support this contention, as narcoleptic patients produced normal total amounts of GH (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, we do believe that our data support the thesis that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian dispersion of hypothalamic GHRH release, which normally confines sleep and GH secretion to the night.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	178	The irregular GH output pattern we found in narcoleptics also supports the notion that hypothalamic GHRH release may be enhanced in this disorder.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The serial orderliness of pulsatile GH release, as determined by the ApEn statistic, reflects the balance of feedforward and feedback inputs into the somatotropic neuroendocrine ensemble (40).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In the present study, GH output was more irregular in narcoleptic patients than in their healthy controls, which suggests that negative feedback restraint of somatotropic activity is muted and/or that positive feedforward inputs are enhanced in narcolepsy (40).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	181	In conclusion, this study documents irregular release of normal amounts of GH in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In addition, the circadian dispersion of GH-secretory events is altered in narcoleptics, so that a relatively large fraction of total production occurs during the daytime.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	183	 We propose that an altered circadian distribution of GHRH release, brought about by hypocretin deficiency, simultaneously causes increased daytime GH secretion and enhanced daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy.
