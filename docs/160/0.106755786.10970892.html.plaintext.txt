Familial prion diseases are thought to result from a change in structure of the mutant prion protein (PrP), which takes a pathogenic conformation. We have examined the role of molecular chaperones in the folding of normal and mutant PrP Q217R (PrP217) in transfected neuroblastoma cells. In a previous report we showed that, although most of the PrP217 forms escape the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system and aggregate in post-Golgi compartments, a significant proportion of PrP217 retains the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidyl inositol signal peptide (PrP32), and does not exit the endoplasmic reticulum (Singh, N., Zanusso, G., Chen, S. G., Fujioka, H., Richardson, S., Gambetti, P., and Petersen, R. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28461-28470). We have now studied the folding and turnover of PrP32 to understand the mechanism by which abnormal PrP forms cause cellular toxicity in our cell culture model and in the human brain carrying the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease Q217R mutation. In this report, we show that PrP32 remains associated with the chaperone BiP for an abnormally prolonged period of time and is degraded by the proteasomal pathway. This study is the first demonstration that BiP is chaperoning the folding of PrP and plays a role in maintaining the quality control in the PrP maturation pathway. Our data provide new insight into the diverse pathways of mutant PrP metabolism and neurotoxicity.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are neurodegenerative disorders that can be sporadic, inherited, or acquired by infection (1, 2). The underlying pathogenetic event in all prion diseases is a conformational modification of the normal or cellular prion protein (PrPC)1 from a soluble form with a predominant -helical conformation to the pathogenic form that is aggregated, rich in -sheets, and partially resistant to proteinase-K (PK) digestion (PrPSc) (1, 3). According to the "protein only" hypothesis, PrPSc interacts directly with the host-encoded PrPC, which is then converted to PrPSc. PrPSc accumulates in the nervous tissue, and causes disease when it reaches a critical threshold (1).
Several lines of evidence indicate that the PrPC to PrPSc conversion is mediated by chaperone(s) (4). Molecular chaperones Hsp104 and GroEL have been shown to promote the conversion reaction of mammalian PrPC in a cell-free system and the conversion of prion-like proteins in intact yeast cells (5-7). Several chemical chaperones have been shown to act as conversion inhibitors (5). Data from transgenic animal models argue for the requirement of an accessory protein for the refolding of PrPC to PrPSc. This protein, temporarily named protein X, remains to be identified (1) and may very well be a cellular chaperone.
In the inherited forms of human prion diseases, which include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and fatal familial insomnia, mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP) are believed to destabilize the mutant PrP, which then easily converts to PrPSc (2, 4). Our series of studies using human neuroblastoma cell models of inherited prion diseases are indeed consistent with this hypothesis (8, 9). Although these models do not lead to the spontaneous formation of PrPSc, they show that PrP variants carrying a human pathogenic mutation either become insoluble and are trapped in intracellular compartments (9), or are rapidly degraded through the proteasomal system (8). If proteasomal function is impaired, the mutant PrP accumulates in an insoluble and weakly PK-resistant form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-ER compartments (8, 9).
These findings argue that chaperones play a double role in inherited prion diseases. They are likely to be involved not only in the conversion of PrP to PrPSc, as in other forms of prion diseases (5), but may also play a role in the destabilizing effect that the PRNP mutations have on the mutant PrP. Interaction of mutant PrP with chaperones might promote its degradation and delay the conversion to PrPSc, helping to explain the conundrum of why inherited prion diseases often manifest clinically only late in life even though the mutation is present from conception.
To begin to unravel the role of chaperones in prion diseases, PRNP-transfected neuroblastoma cells were used to examine the role of ER-localized molecular chaperones in the processing of normal and mutant PrP. The mutation at PRNP codon 217 resulting in the substitution of glutamine to arginine (Q217R) in the mutant PrP (PrP217) is associated with a GSS disease phenotype that presents in the seventh decade and is characterized by a slowly progressive dementia associated with cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs (10). The histopathological hallmark of the Q217R GSS variant is the presence of PrP217-containing amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary degeneration in the brain tissue (10). In a previous study carried out on a transfected neuroblastoma cell model of GSS Q217R, we showed that a significant proportion of PrP217, which we identified as PrP32, retains the anchor C-terminal signal peptide, fails to acquire the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is retained in the ER by the cellular quality control system. In this study, we provide the first evidence that the ER chaperone BiP binds to PrP. It binds transiently to PrPC and to some forms of PrP217, but it remains associated for an extended period of time to PrP32, which is subsequently degraded by the proteasomal pathway. At variance with the anchored forms of PrP217 that are aggregated, insoluble in non-ionic detergents, and partially resistant to proteinase-K (PK) digestion (9), a relatively large portion of PrP32 remains soluble and sensitive to PK digestion. We postulate that the association of PrP32 with BiP sequesters PrP32 and prevents the formation of homoaggregates, maintaining PrP32 relatively soluble and PK-sensitive.

Materials, Cell Culture Conditions, and Production of Transfected Cell Lines-- The human neuroblastoma cell line M17 was obtained from Dr. J. Beidler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Opti-MEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, methionine, and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies Inc.; hygromycin B and lactacystin were from Calbiochem; Tran35S-label was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA); protein A-agarose, N-glycosidase F, and endoglycosidase H were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Transfected M17 cells expressing wild type or mutant prion protein (Q217R) were generated as described (9). The endogenous PrP in M17 cells is expressed at very low levels and is barely detectable by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, whereas the transfected wild type and mutant PrP expression is at least 10-fold higher. All cultures were maintained at 37  degrees C in Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cultures of transfected cells were supplemented with 500  microg/ml hygromycin. Experiments were performed on bulk-selected cells at different times post-transfection. For all experiments, cells were replated overnight and used at 90-95% confluency. Plasmids containing normal and mutant (T34G) hamster BiP cDNA were a kind gift of Linda Hendershot (St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and James Gaut (University of Michigan). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-KDEL (a monoclonal antibody to the peptide KDEL that recognizes Grp94, BiP, and two other proteins of 64 and 47 kDa), anti-hamster BiP, anti-calreticulin, and anti-Grp94 from StressGen, anti-PrP (3F4), a monoclonal antibody to PrP residues 109-112 from R. Kascsak (New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities), anti-calnexin rabbit immune serum from A. Helenius (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich), and anti-GPI-SP mouse serum raised in our facility against a synthetic peptide representing the GPI-SP of PrP.
Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation-- In a typical experiment, 9  x  106 cells were used for each cell line. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described (8, 9), with the following modifications. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments for the detection of PrP-chaperone complexes, cells were radiolabeled with 50  microCi/ml Tran35S-label for 2 h in methionine-cysteine-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed serum, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Tris 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, pH 7.4), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. For co-immunoprecipitation with anti-BiP, lysates were depleted of ATP by incubation with 50 units/ml Apyrase (Sigma) for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 800  x  g, and the clarified cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine. Protein-antibody complexes bound to protein A-agarose were washed four times with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and bound protein was eluted by boiling in sample buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% -mercaptoethanol). For re-immunoprecipitation with the second antibody, eluted protein was diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above. Both the first and second immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE fluorography. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors (lactacystin 80  microM, ALLN 80  microM) for 1 h before labeling with 50  microCi/ml Tran35S-label in methionine-cysteine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum. Where indicated, appropriate inhibitors were included in the labeling and chase medium. At the indicated times, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting-- For detecting co-immunoprecipitated BiP by Western blotting, radiolabeled cell lysates of PrPC and PrP217 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-GPI-SP antibody. Proteins were eluted from protein A-agarose beads by sample buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One half of the gel was processed for fluorography, whereas the other half was electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for 2.5 h at 70 V at 4  degrees C. Membranes containing transferred proteins were blocked in TBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37  degrees C, and probed with the anti-KDEL antibody (diluted 1:1000) in dilution buffer (TBS, 1% normal goat serum and 0.05% bovine serum albumin). Immunoreactive bands were detected with anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:4000) and visualized on autoradiographic film by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Cell Homogenization and Enzymatic Deglycosylation-- PrP217 cells were radiolabeled in the absence or presence of ALLN for 2 h, and the membrane and soluble fractions were separated by standard procedures. Briefly, cells were washed and homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol by 10 strokes of a Kontes all-glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was checked microscopically for cell lysis and centrifuged to pellet the nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000  x  g to separate the membrane and soluble fractions, which were supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-KDEL or 3F4 antibodies.
For deglycosylation, radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated proteins were reprecipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol and resuspended in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% -mercaptoethanol). Samples were boiled for 10 min and deglycosylated with N-glycosidase-F (1000 units in 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) or endoglycosidase-H (1000 units in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5) for 1-3 h at 37  degrees C. Proteins were reprecipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol at 20  degrees C for 2 h, dissolved in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE fluorography.
Cell Permeabilization with Streptolysin-O-- Permeabilization of cells with streptolysin-O (SLO) was performed as described (11). In short, 4 units/ml SLO were activated in a buffer containing 115 mM KOAc, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM dithiothreitol at 37  degrees C for 30 min. Cells were then washed with transport buffer (115 mM KOAc, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2), and incubated with 3 ml of activated SLO for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed three times with cold transport buffer, and incubated at 37  degrees C for 15 min in the same buffer for pore formation. Optimum permeabilization was assessed by determining lactate dehydrogenase activity released into the transport buffer (70% release was considered optimal).
Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy-- For immunofluorescent staining, PrPC or PrP217 cells were grown on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and either cultured in complete medium (control), or treated with ALLN in the same medium for 2 h. One sample of each was permeabilized with SLO as described above. Untreated and ALLN-treated SLO-permeabilized cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and processed for immunostaining. Another set of ALLN-treated samples was fixed as above and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min. Both SLO- and Triton-permeabilized cells were processed for immunostaining with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (1:20 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20 dilution; green) and anti-calnexin C terminus immune serum (1:40 dilution) followed by RITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:25 dilution; red) (see Fig. 4). Samples were then observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad).     RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Highly Abnormal Forms of PrP217 Are Retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Are Associated with the Chaperone BiP-- As we have reported in a previous study, mature PrPC migrates as three distinct bands, which correspond to the PrPC with two, one, and no glycans, respectively. In contrast, PrP217 shows an additional band of 32 kDa (PrP32), which migrates at 30 kDa (rather than at 27 kDa as PrPC) following deglycosylation (Fig. 1, lane 3 versus 6). We have previously shown that PrP32 lacks the GPI anchor and retains the 22-amino acid GPI C-terminal signal peptide (GPI-SP) (9). Furthermore, PrP32, as well as two other forms of PrP217 migrating at 29-30 kDa, remain endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, indicating that they are not transported out of the ER (Fig. 1, lane 5).
View larger version (85K):    Fig. 1.   Highly abnormal forms of PrP217 are retained in the ER. PrPC or PrP217 cells radiolabeled for 2 h were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PrP antibody 3F4 and analyzed by fluorography. PrPC lysates show three distinct bands corresponding to the three glycoforms of PrP: a highly glycosylated diffuse band of 33-42 kDa, intermediate bands of 29 and 30 kDa with one or two glycans, and a discrete band of 27 kDa representing the unglycosylated form of PrP (lane 1). PrP217 shows a band of 32 kDa (PrP32) in addition to the three glycoforms observed in PrPC (lane 4, marked with asterisks). As expected, all PrPC and PrP217 forms co-migrate with the 27-kDa form upon deglycosylation with N-glycosidase-F (PNGase) except PrP32, which migrates at ~30 kDa (lanes 3 versus 6). Treatment of lysates with endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) shows that all the PrPC forms are resistant to cleavage (lane 2). In contrast, PrP32 and the PrP217 bands migrating at ~29-30 kDa remain endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, suggesting that they are not transported from the ER (lane 5).
To determine if the PrP32 that is retained in the ER is bound to a molecular chaperone, Trans[35S]methionine-labeled PrPC and PrP217 cells were lysed under non-denaturing conditions and immunoprecipitated with anti-KDEL (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3), or anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4) prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Anti-KDEL is a monoclonal antibody raised to the C-terminal ER retention signal KDEL of proteins and reacts with BiP (Grp78), Grp94, and Hsp47. After immunoprecipitation with anti-KDEL, four major bands are detected in both PrPC and PrP217 lysates, which include a band of 94 kDa corresponding to Grp94 (not shown), a 78-kDa band (BiP), and two additional bands of 64 and 47 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). However, in the PrP217 lysates, an additional band that migrates at 32 kDa is detected (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of lysates with the anti-PrP antibody 3F4 shows that only the 32-kDa PrP isoform of PrP217 lysates co-migrates with a similar form detected in anti-KDEL immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 3, respectively). To characterize this 32-kDa band immunoprecipitated by the anti-KDEL antibody, anti-KDEL immunoprecipitates from both PrPC and PrP217 lysates were re-immunoprecipitated with two anti-PrP antibodies: one directed to the conserved sequence of PrP, the other to the C-terminal GPI-SP (anti-GPI-SP), which we have previously shown to be uncleaved in PrP32 (9). With both antibodies, only the 32-kDa band was recovered from PrP217 immunoprecipitates, whereas no bands were recovered from the PrPC preparation (Figs. 2A and 2B, lanes 5, 6, and 2, respectively). Furthermore, when PrPC and PrP217 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PrP antibody after prolonged radiolabeling, BiP was recovered, along with the various PrP forms, but only from the PrP217 preparations (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 versus 8). Combined, these experiments clearly show that the 32-kDa band recovered following immunoprecipitation with antibodies to KDEL contains PrP32 and that PrP32 is associated with BiP in the Q217R transfected neuroblastoma cells. Finally, immunoblotting of proteins eluted from the GPI-SP immunoprecipitates with the anti-KDEL antibody identified only the 78-kDa BiP band (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation under similar conditions with anti-calnexin, anti-Grp94, or anti-calreticulin antibodies did not co-immunoprecipitate PrP32 or any other isoform of PrPC or PrP217 (data not shown). Therefore, PrP32 is associated with BiP, but not with any of the other ER chaperones.
View larger version (42K):    Fig. 2.   PrP32 is associated with the chaperone BiP in the ER. A, cells expressing PrPC or PrP217 were radiolabeled for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with either anti-KDEL (lanes 1 and 3) or anti-PrP (lanes 2 and 4) antibodies. Fluorography shows that only PrP32 co-immunoprecipitates with anti-KDEL, and co-migrates with a similar form detected in anti-PrP immunoprecipitates (lanes 3 and 4). No PrPC forms co-immunoprecipitate with anti-KDEL (lanes 1 and 2). Proteins immunoprecipitated from PrPC and PrP217 lysates with anti-KDEL were eluted from agarose beads and re-immunoprecipitated with anti-PrP. No protein band is detected in the PrPC sample (lane 5), whereas from PrP217, only PrP32 is re-immunoprecipitated (lane 6). Overexposed anti-PrP immunoprecipitates of PrPC and PrP217 lysates show that only a 78-kDa band corresponding to BiP co-immunoprecipitates with PrP217 (lanes 7 and 8). B, radiolabeled PrPC and PrP217 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GPI-SP antibody and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One set of samples was analyzed by fluorography, whereas the other set was transblotted and probed with anti-KDEL antibody. No PrP form is detected in PrPC immunoprecipitates, and only PrP32 is detected in the PrP217 sample (lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblotting with anti-KDEL shows only the 78-kDa BiP band in the PrP217 immunoprecipitates (lane 3). C, PrPC and PrP217 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding hamster BiP, and transient transfectants were radiolabeled for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with anti-hamster-BiP antibody. PrP32 is detected in the PrP217 immunoprecipitates (lanes 3 and 4) but not in the PrPC samples (lanes 1 and 2).
These data were reproduced using PrPC and PrP217 cells that had been retransfected with a construct expressing hamster BiP. Following immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled lysates from these cells with the anti-hamster BiP antibody, a band co-migrating with PrP32 was recovered from the PrP217 lysates (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4), whereas no bands co-migrating with any of the PrPC forms were detected from the PrPC preparations (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2).
PrP32 Is Degraded by the Proteasomal Pathway-- Pulse-chase analysis of PrP217 following immunoprecipitation with an anti-PrP antibody showed that, with no treatment, about 40% of the PrP32 present at zero time following a 10-min pulse remained after 1 h of chase (Figs. 3A, lanes 1-3, and 3B). In contrast, in the presence of ALLN, an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation, all of the PrP32 and three other bands of ~27-30 kDa were recovered after the same chase time (Figs. 3A, lanes 4-6, and 3B). Highly glycosylated PrP forms of 32-42 kDa were also present, which probably represent glycosylated 27- to 30-kDa forms rescued from degradation by ALLN (lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitation was carried out under the same pulse-chase conditions with the antibody to KDEL, rather than to PrP (Figs. 3A, lanes 7-12, and 3B). In the absence of ALLN, only 23% of PrP32 was recovered after 1 h of chase (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-9). In the presence of ALLN, PrP32 was not degraded and the 27- to 30-kDa bands were also detected (Figs. 3A, lanes 10-12, and 3B). In experiments with a longer chase in the presence of ALLN, a significant amount of PrP32 could be co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-KDEL antibody even after 6 h (data not shown). Thus, PrP32 remains associated with BiP for an abnormally prolonged period of time and is degraded by the proteasomal pathway (Fig. 3B).
View larger version (39K):    Fig. 3.   PrP32 is degraded by the proteasomes. A, PrP217 cells were either left untreated or preincubated with ALLN for 1 h and radiolabeled for 10 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-PrP (lanes 1-6) or anti-KDEL (lanes 7-12) after a chase for the indicated times in the absence or presence of the same inhibitor. Following the pulse (t = 0), PrP217 glycoforms representing the unglycosylated (27 kDa) and partially glycosylated (29 and 30 kDa) forms, and PrP32 are seen in both untreated and ALLN-treated samples (lanes 1 and 4). After a chase of 30 min (t = 0.5), as expected, the highly glycosylated forms of PrP appear (lanes 2 and 5). Although all the PrP217 forms degrade slowly in untreated samples and only ~40% of PrP32 remains after 1 h of chase (lanes 1-3), following treatment with ALLN, almost all of PrP32 remains. Furthermore, additional forms of 27-30 kDa and highly glycosylated forms of 32-42 kDa are detected (lanes 4-6). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-KDEL antibody shows similar kinetics of degradation of PrP32 without and with ALLN treatment and demonstrates an additional band of 30 kDa (lanes 7-12). B, the numerical data are expressed as percentage of initial PrP32 synthesized at different chase times in the absence or presence of ALLN and plotted as the mean  plus or minus  S.D. (n = 3). (Significance: 0.5 h, p  <  43; 1 h, p  <  53). C, from PrP217 cells radiolabeled for 2 h in the absence or presence of ALLN, membrane and cytosolic fractions were isolated, immunoprecipitated with anti-PrP antibody, and analyzed by fluorography. Although all the PrP217 glycoforms partition in the membrane fraction (P), a small amount of PrP32 is detected in the soluble fraction (S) (lanes 1 and 2). After treatment with ALLN, this fraction increases by 30% (lanes 2 versus 4), and an additional band of ~28 kDa is detected (lane 4). The faster migrating 28-kDa band is unglycosylated, because it is insensitive to PNGase, as opposed to PrP32 which migrates at 30 kDa after deglycosylation (lanes 5 and 6).
Separation of the membrane-bound and soluble PrP217 fractions showed that, although all the PrP217 glycoforms and 76% of PrP32 were detected in the membrane-rich pellet fraction, a small amount of PrP32 was recovered in the membrane-free supernatant (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). Following ALLN treatment, the amount of PrP32 in the pellet increased by only 2.4%, whereas the fraction detected in the supernatant showed a significant increase of 30% compared with untreated samples (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 versus 3 and 2 versus 4). Moreover, an additional form of ~28 kDa was detected in the soluble fraction in the presence of ALLN (Fig. 3C, lane 4), which may represent an intermediate product of PrP32 generated during proteasomal degradation. This form was unglycosylated, because it was insensitive to PNGase treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, soluble, membrane-free forms of PrP32 increases after proteasomal inhibition, indicating that PrP32 is retrotranslocated out of the ER. We did not detect ubiquitination of PrP32, or of the other PrP32-related forms (Data not shown).
We used immunofluorescence to determine whether PrP32 or its degradation product(s) accumulate in the cytosol and form an aggresome-like structure following proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 4). Control and ALLN-treated PrPC and PrP217 cells were treated with streptolysin-O (SLO) that selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane (11), leaving all intracellular membrane organelles intact. Thus, the externally added antibodies had access only to cytosolic proteins and to epitopes of proteins exposed on the cytosolic side of the membranes. Following SLO treatment, PrPC and PrP217 were detected only at the surface of control and ALLN-treated cells (green), whereas immunoreactivity to the C terminus of calnexin, which is located at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, was readily detected (red) (Fig. 4, panels 1-4). In contrast, following treatment with detergent that permeabilizes all cellular membranes, a small amount of PrPC was observed in the Golgi region, whereas PrP217 was present in much larger quantity, and for the most part co-distributed with the ER (panels 5 and 6). Therefore, following inhibition of proteasomal degradation, PrP32 did not form an aggresome-like structure in the cytosol, as has been reported for other secretory proteins degraded by the proteasome (12, 13).
View larger version (29K):    Fig. 4.   PrP32 rescued from proteasomal degradation does not aggregate in the cytosol. PrPC and PrP217 cells cultured in the absence or presence of ALLN for 2 h were permeabilized with SLO and immunostained with anti-PrP (green) or anti-calnexin C terminus antibody (red) in the absence or presence of detergent. In SLO-permeabilized PrPC and PrP217 cells, only surface PrP staining is detected in both control and ALLN-treated samples (panels 1-4). No intracellular PrP staining is seen. In the presence of detergent, PrPC staining can be detected on the cell surface and in the Golgi area after ALLN treatment (panel 5). PrP217 cells show additional PrP immunoreactivity in the ER and other intracellular membrane organelles (panel 6). Immunoreactivity to the C terminus of calnexin (red) is seen as a reticular ER pattern in all samples as expected, indicating that cytosolic proteins are accessible in both sets of samples.

BiP has been shown to promote proper folding of newly synthesized polypeptides by keeping the precursors in a soluble state (12, 14-17). It interacts transiently with proteins, which presumably are properly folded. In contrast, it binds misfolded or unassembled proteins in relatively stable complexes and may mediate their retrograde translocation for proteasomal degradation (18-26). Our data provide the first evidence that BiP plays these roles in the processing of PrP. BiP briefly interacts in the ER with PrPC (Fig. 3A).2 This brief interaction is consistent with BiP involvement in the folding of nascent PrPC, which, presumably, promptly assumes the correct folding state. BiP interaction with the PrP carrying the Q217R mutation is more complex. In our neuroblastoma cell model, this mutant PrP is expressed in two major variants. The first variant, here referred to as PrP217, includes three glycoforms and carries a GPI anchor as PrPC. The second variant, PrP32, which accounts for approximately 11% of the total Q217R mutant PrP, is glycosylated but lacks the GPI anchor and carries the uncleaved GPI anchor signal peptide (9). Unlike PrPC, PrP217 is unstable and approximately 50% of it becomes insoluble and aggregates in a compartment distal to the cis-Golgi. Furthermore, the instability leading to aggregation is very likely due to misfolding, because it is largely corrected by exposure of the nascent PrP217 to low temperatures known to favor correct folding (9). However, despite the likely misfolding, PrP217 interacts with BiP only briefly in a way that is indistinguishable from that of PrPC, and, like PrPC, exits the ER (9). In contrast, BiP interaction with PrP32 is sustained and results in the retention of this form in the ER, but eventually PrP32 is translocated into the cytosol and degraded in the proteasomal system. Only BiP, among a variety of protein-folding chaperones present in the ER, shows this association with PrP32. The mechanism leading to the different BiP interaction and cellular routing between PrP217 and PrP32 is unclear. It might be due to the lack of the GPI anchor and/or the presence of the GPI signal peptide that makes it impossible for PrP32 to enter the secretory pathway (27-32). Other mechanisms are also possible. For example, the different BiP binding might be related to intrinsic conformational differences between the two Q217R PrP variants. The conformation of some of the mutant PrP might be altered to such an extent that the anchor signal peptide cannot be cleaved, blocking the anchor addition and resulting in the formation of the PrP32 variant. Alternatively, the sustained association of PrP32 with BiP by itself might interfere with the anchor addition process. Regardless of the mechanism, it is remarkable that two major types of Q217R mutant PrP, PrP217 and PrP32, interact differently with BiP, and after this interaction, are processed through different routes. PrP217 aggregates in a post-Golgi compartment, most likely the endosomal-lysosomal system, and eventually is degraded, because it does not accumulate. In contrast, PrP32 remains largely soluble, and is degraded by the proteasome. However, inhibition of proteasomal function, which has no effect on PrP217, results in increased amounts of PrP32 in the ER and the cytosol. Presumably, the impairment of the endosomal-lysosomal degradation leads to the accumulation of PrP217. Thus, each of the two forms of Q217R mutant PrP has the potential to perturb the cellular metabolism, but by distinct mechanisms.
We have previously shown that another mutant PrP caused by the presence of a stop codon at PRNP position 145 (PrP145) is also degraded by the proteasomal pathway (8). PrP145 is C terminus-truncated, lacks the anchor, and is associated with a GSS phenotype. Therefore, proteasomal degradation is shared by mutant PrP variants lacking the GPI anchor. However, unlike PrP32, PrP145 is not bound to BiP, perhaps because part or the whole C-terminal region is needed for this binding.
In addition to PrP, several other secretory and membrane proteins implicated in causing disease are degraded by the proteasomal pathway when they are mutated and aggregate in intracellular compartments following the inhibition of proteasomal function (12, 25, 26, 33-37). The proteins implicated in neurodegeneration include huntingtin, which forms intranuclear aggregates in Huntington's disease, ataxins 1 and 3, associated with forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (38-41), and -synuclein, the major component of the cytoplasmic Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (42). The central theme in these disorders, as in prion diseases, is the conversion of a normally soluble and functional protein into a -sheet-rich structure that is insoluble, aggregates, and forms intracellular deposits. Contrary to previous assumptions, it appears now that intranuclear aggregates of huntingtin may have a protective role rather than causing neuronal damage (40, 41). Mutant huntingtin has been shown to be toxic in the absence of aggregates (41), and it is argued that, by capturing the toxic protein, the aggregate may protect the cell from this toxicity. Thus, the neurotoxic cascade might start before the formation of aggregates, possibly by soluble intermediates that escape degradation (43). Our results on PrP32 are consistent with this scenario. Although BiP prevents the aggregation and facilitates degradation of PrP32, it may in fact render PrP32 more pathogenic by maintaining it in a partially unfolded state in the ER, especially if BiP promotes the refolding of PrP32 into an alternative, more pathogenic form, instead of its aggregation when proteasomal function is compromised.
In conclusion, the present finding, that the two mutant PrP variants generated by the Q217R PRNP mutation are processed through entirely different metabolic pathways, underscores the complexity and diversity of the pathogenic perturbation that may be caused by a simple point mutation. Only a detailed study of the metabolism of the mutant protein can bring to light this complexity, which must be understood before the optimal therapeutic intervention can be established.
