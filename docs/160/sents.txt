A few weeks before, a colossal blackout involved the USA and Canada; it was the greatest in history since the diffusion of electricity..

Since 11 September 2001, we feel that globalization is bringing more than the opening up of markets; we now fear terrorist attacks [1]. The SARS epidemic and mad cow disease confronted us with new, potentially lethal diseases and with the dangers of forcing nature in order to increase food production [2]. Nevertheless, in daily life we have lost the sense of danger..

The aqueduct water was polluted in some areas and at risk in others. In such a situation, in which there is the risk of massive microbiological or toxic (metals and biological compounds) contamination, the water depuration systems, targeted to the usually low amount of contaminants present in the aqueduct water, do not guarantee that the water is pure enough for dialysis. This is both true in the case of large depuration systems, with reverse osmosis, such as those employed in the large dialysis centres, where a water purity problem could endanger hundreds of patients within a couple of days, and, even more so, in the case of home haemodialysis patients, whose water treatment system consists of a small  portable  osmosis kit and a water softener..

In recent years, this technique was, on average, employed in 3 to 5% of hospital dialysis patients, a pool of 65 to 70 cases, out of a global dialysis population of about 200 patients, 45 to 55 on peritoneal dialysis, 18 to 22 on home haemodialysis and the rest in out-of-hospital settings..

However, there is still a significant disparity regarding the understanding and nomenclature of PrPSc types. In addition, it is still unknown whether a specific PrPSc type is associated with each TSE phenotypic variant. In sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), five disease phenotypes are known, but only two major types of PrPSc, types 1 and 2, have been consistently reproduced. We further analyzed PrPSc properties in sCJD and variant CJD using a high resolution gel electrophoresis system and varying experimental conditions. We found that pH varies among CJD brain homogenates in standard buffers, thereby influencing the characteristics of protease-treated PrPSc. We also show that PrPSc type 1 and type 2 are heterogeneous species which can be further distinguished into five molecular subtypes that fit the current histopathological classification of sCJD variants. Our results shed light on previous disparities in PrPSc typing, provide a refined classification of human PrPSc types, and support the notion that the pathological TSE phenotype is related to PrPSc structure..

Human diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, kuru, and fatal insomnia (1-3). CJD, by far the most common human TSE, may occur as a sporadic disease of unknown etiology (sCJD), a disease associated with mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), or a proven exogenous infection. The latter group includes variant CJD (vCJD) a distinct disease phenotype that is believed to have been transmitted from cattle to humans through the consumption of contaminated meat (3)..

There is no agent replication or transmission of infectivity in the absence of PrPc expression (5). Moreover, an abnormal, partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of PrPc specifically accumulates in the nervous system during infection and represents the hallmark of the disease (4, 6). The conversion of PrPc to PrPSc is a posttranslational event associated with an increase in -sheet secondary structure in the protein (7, 8)..

In scrapie transmitted to mice, the most extensively studied TSE, the strain of the agent and the host genotype variability determined by polymorphisms in the coding region of PRNP are the major determinants of disease phenotype (10). Different prion strains transmit diseases to syngenic animals that differ in topography, type of lesion, and intracerebral distribution of PrPSc. In humans, disease susceptibility and phenotypic expression are influenced by PRNP mutations and by the polymorphism at codon 129 that encodes either methionine (M) or valine (V) (11-13).

Furthermore, evidence from transmission studies indicates that the different PrPSc types showing distinct physicochemical properties represent genuine biochemical signatures of individual strain-host genotype interactions. Because the analysis of biochemical properties of PrPSc is much less time-consuming than bioassays in mice, unraveling the physicochemical properties of PrPSc associated with each TSE strain or phenotype (i.e. PrPSc "typing") has undoubtedly become of crucial importance for strain typing and molecular classification of TSEs, with wide implications for both disease diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance..

0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	14	Unfortunately, there is a significant disparity in the literature regarding the existence of distinct human PrPSc types (23-27), and this to some extent is also true for animal TSEs (28-30). Based on differences in gel mobility and N-terminal sequence of the core fragments generated by proteinase K (PK), Parchi et al. (23-25) originally identified two human PrPSc types (named type 1 and type 2). Type 1 has a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa and the primary cleavage site at residue 82, and type 2 has a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa and the primary cleavage at residue 97. In other studies, however, the PrPSc type 1 from codon 129 MM subjects was further distinguished into 2 subtypes showing a less than a 1-kDa difference in mobility (26, 27). According to Wadsworth et al. (26) the two PrPSc type 1 subtypes, they named types 1 and 2, show indistinguishable fragment sizes only when PK digestion is performed in the presence of 20 mM EDTA, thereby representing two distinct conformations acquired by PrPSc in the presence of metal ions such as copper and zinc. In contrast, the two putative PrPSc subtypes described by Zanusso et al. (27), also named types 1 and 2 although not comparable with those of Wadsworth et al. (26), would represent two distinct protein conformations because of a different response to pH variations (i.e. one conformation is pH-dependent; the other is not). The rationale for the study of the effect of metal ions and pH on PrPSc properties lies in the finding that the octapeptide repeat PrPc sequence between residues 51 and 91 is a Cu 2+ binding motif that changes its conformation in the presence of copper and that this copper binding stoichiometry is pH-dependent (31, 32)..

0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	16	In previous studies on PrPSc typing in sCJD, we also reported a certain degree of heterogeneity within both type 1 and type 2 samples, particularly among type 1 samples from codon 129 MM subjects (23, 24). However, these were subtle biochemical differences compared with the type 1/type 2 difference in relative molecular mass and failed to show a consistent reproducibility or a correlation with the disease pathological phenotype, suggesting that they might be related to the experimental conditions rather than to intrinsic differences in strains. For example, it is noteworthy that the various protocols that have been applied to define PrPSc properties to date included the use of PK well outside its optimal conditions (i.e. pH optimum above 7.5; optimum temperature above 37  degrees C) (33, 34) and, above all, were not standardized with respect to variables that might affect its activity. On the other hand, the characterization of at least five distinct pathological sCJD subtypes (9) argues for the existence of more than two prion strains and two PrPSc types. Thus, it is conceivable that the application of more sensitive techniques and more rigorous experimental conditions will lead to the distinction between potential artifacts related to sample preparation and disease-specific biochemical differences suitable for a refined classification of CJD PrPSc types. To reach this goal, shed light on the current PrPSc typing controversies, and further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of TSE strains and phenotypic variability, we examined the effect of different experimental conditions on the characteristics of PrPSc fragments associated with the sCJD subtypes and vCJD using a high resolution gel electrophoresis system. Particular emphasis has been given to the study of the interplay between the effects of homogenate pH and PK concentration/activity..

Particular emphasis has been given to the study of the interplay between the effects of homogenate pH and PK concentration/activity..

To this aim, we raised the buffer capacity of the lysis buffer, PBS, and citrate-phosphate buffer solutions and obtained the desired effect by increasing 10-fold either the Tris and the phosphate or citrate-phosphate salt concentration. We found that in sCJD MM1 cases the immunoblot profile of the PrPSc core fragments generated by PK digestion in standard conditions (100  microg/ml at 37  degrees C for 1 h) varied significantly according to the homogenate pH and showed a shift in gel mobility between pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 3).

By increasing the pH values of the homogenate we obtained a progressive disappearance of the slowest migrating peptides associated with a parallel increase in the amount of the fastest migrating fragments together with the appearance around pH 7.2 of a novel fragment that migrated even faster. Finally, an additional (6th) slower migrating fragment was detected after digestion at a very acidic pH (5.0-5.5) (Fig. 3), whereas no digestion at all was observed at pH 4.0 (data not shown).

Whereas at pH values below 7.2 PK digestion of PrPSc extracted from sCJD MM1 showed a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa, at pH values higher than 7.3 the protein migrated about 1 kDa faster (Fig. 5). Both fragments were seen at pH 7.2-7.3. All MM1 (n = 40) subjects analyzed showed this shift in gel migration. The shift in electrophoretic mobility did not disappear when we prolonged the PK incubation time to the almost complete PrPSc digestion (Fig. 10 and data not shown), further suggesting a direct effect of pH on PrPSc independent from its effect on PK activity..

Considering our results on the effect of pH and that EDTA, according to the protocol of Wadsworth et al. (26), is prepared in a basic solution at pH 8 and then added to the homogenate, we investigated whether a change in pH rather than the EDTA itself could be responsible for the observed shift in gel mobility of PrPSc. Indeed, our results indicate that this is the case (Fig. 7). We measured the homogenate pH before and after the addition of EDTA and found that the addition of EDTA-prepared stock solution at pH 8.0 to standard PBS or LB, pH 7.4, significantly increased the pH value of the homogenate (about 0.7 pH units) (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we were not able to reproduce the effect of EDTA when the EDTA solution was adjusted to pH 7.0 before being added to the homogenate (Fig. 7). A potential influence of pH on the copper chelation activity of EDTA is unlikely, since the potential-pH diagram for the copper-EDTA system indicates that EDTA forms stable copper complexes over a wide range of pH values (37). In conclusion, our data argue that EDTA at a 20 mM concentration has no direct effect on the pattern PrPSc type 1 cleavage by PK..

A shift in gel mobility that was clearly dependent on the homogenate pH and did not disappear with increasing PK concentrations was also observed in VV1 subjects. Indeed, PK digestion of VV1 samples at pH 6.9 generated a doublet of about 21 and 20 kDa even when a relatively high PK concentration was used, whereas at pH 8.0 only the fastest migrating fragment was detected (Fig. 8). Thus, the use of a 15-cm-long gel instead of the mini-gel distinguishes between PrPSc type 1 from VV subjects and PrPSc type 1 from MM or MV subjects (Fig. 8a)..

At a pH below 7.4, additional fragments migrating slower than 19 kDa were generated in all these CJD subtypes by a standard PK concentration (i.e. 100  microg/ml); however, they disappeared once the PK activity was increased either by raising the enzyme concentration or by prolonging its incubation time (Figs. 9 and 10 and data not shown).

To answer this question, we compared the effect of different PK concentrations at a given pH value. A qualitative analysis revealed that samples extracted from different CJD subtypes show varying degrees of protease resistance.

The homogenate pH in turn influences the size of the PrPSc core generated by protease digestion due to the combination of at least three factors. (i) Protease digestion of full-length PrPSc is a step-by-step process yielding fragments with various degrees of resistance, (ii) PK activity is pH-dependent, (iii) in sCJD MM1, MV1, and to a lesser extent in VV1, the size of PrPSc further changes depending on whether protease digestion is performed at a pH below or above 7.2..

After the original identification by Parchi et al. (24, 25) of two major PrPSc types (named type 1 and type 2) in sporadic human TSEs, two additional classifications of human PrPSc types have been proposed (26, 27). According to Wadsworth et al. (26) PrPSc type 1 from MM subjects can be distinguished into 2 subtypes based on a 0.5-kDa difference in the relative molecular mass of PrPSc. However, when pK digestion is performed in the presence of at least 20 mM EDTA, the two PrPSc subtypes show the same electrophoretic mobility, with an estimated shift of about 1.100 and 0.650 kDa for the first and second type, respectively. Zanusso et al. (27) also proposed that the Parchi et al. (24) PrPSc type 1 includes two protein subtypes having distinct conformations and strain-specific properties. However, at variance with Wadsworth et al. (26), they distinguished the two PrPSc subtypes based on their sensitivity to pH variations rather than on their presumed degree of binding to metal ions. According to the study by Zanusso et al. (27), about 60% of type 1 samples show a pH-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility, whereas the remaining 40% appear unaffected by pH variations..

However, at variance with the above-mentioned studies, we did not attempt to further sub-classify the human PrPSc types based on the observations that (i) the same degree of variability was also seen in samples taken from the same brain, and ii) this molecular heterogeneity did not correlate with any distinct phenotypic feature..

Thus, we believe that there is no basis at present for claiming that more than one CJD subtype or CJD strain is associated with the molecular combination codon 129 MM genotype and PrPSc type 1. Indeed, our results clearly show that, once the experimental conditions (i.e. homogenate pH, PK concentration, type of detergents) are carefully controlled, the electrophoretic mobility of PrPSc type 1 from MM subjects is highly homogenous. In this respect, it is also noteworthy that experimental transmission of prions from pure MM1 subjects to non-human primates and mice have given to date homogenous results in terms of incubation time or lesion profile (14, 16, 17). These results are in keeping with the original classification of Parchi et al. (9) and strongly suggest that only a single major agent strain is associated with the sCJD MM1 subtype..

The observation raises the interesting question of whether the acidic pH is somehow related to the disease pathogenesis. Previous studies document a decline in post-mortem human brain pH values that positively correlate with age at death and agonal state severity (38, 39). Moreover, we found that in non-human primates experimentally infected with prions who did not suffer from an agonal state, the brain pH was much less acidic (data not shown).

0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	72	Our data also shed light on the current understanding of the molecular basis of human TSE strains and phenotypic variability. Several lines of evidence indicate that the pathological heterogeneity of human TSEs is related to the physicochemical properties of protease-resistant prion protein (24, 25). However, whether each phenotype is indeed related to a specific PrPSc tertiary or quaternary structure is still unknown. In sporadic CJD five phenotypes have been characterized, but only two major PrPSc types have been consistently reproduced based on difference in the relative molecular mass of PrPSc (9). By using gels with improved resolution and different experimental conditions, we have now shown that PrPSc type 1 in codon 129 MM or MV subjects has distinct physicochemical properties from the type 1 in the VV homozygotes. In addition, only in MM1/MV1 and VV1 samples did PrPSc show a pH-dependent shift in gel mobility. Our data also show that distinct physicochemical properties characterize the sCJD subtypes associated to PrPSc type 2. For example, PrPSc from MV subjects with kuru plaques is clearly distinguishable from the other type 2s because it uniquely resolves as a doublet, even when a relatively high pK concentration is used. Furthermore, we have shown that PrPSc from VV2 subjects as well as vCJD display a significantly higher protease resistance than the PrPSc from MM2-cortical cases. Thus, analysis of protease resistance may allow the distinction between VV2 and MM2-cortical cases without PRNP genotyping and further helps, in combination with the study of PrPSc glycoform ratio (36), to distinguish vCJD from other CJD MM2 subtypes. Taken together, these data demonstrate that there are specific PrPSc properties associated with each sCJD pathological phenotype as well as vCJD, supporting the notion that at least in human TSEs the pathological phenotype is related to differences in PrPSc molecular structure..

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Lipodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of human disorders characterized by the anomalous distribution of body fat associated with insulin resistance and altered lipid metabolism. The pathogenetic mechanism of inherited lipodystrophies is not yet clear; at the molecular level they have been linked to mutations of lamin A/C, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and other seemingly unrelated proteins. In this study, we examined lamin A/C processing in three laminopathies characterized by lipodystrophic phenotypes: Dunnigan type familial partial lipodystrophy, mandibuloacral dysplasia and atypical Werner's syndrome. We found that the lamin A precursor was specifically accumulated in lipodystrophy cells. Pre-lamin A was located at the nuclear envelope and co-localized with the adipocyte transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we obtained the first demonstration of an in vivo interaction between SREBP1 and pre-lamin A. Binding of SREBP1 to the lamin A precursor was detected in patient fibroblasts as well as in control fibroblasts forced to accumulate pre-lamin A by farnesylation inhibitors. In contrast, SREBP1 did not interact in vivo with mature lamin A or C in cultured fibroblasts. To gain insights into the effect of pre-lamin A accumulation in adipose tissue, we inhibited lamin A precursor processing in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our results show that pre-lamin A sequesters SREBP1 at the nuclear rim, thus decreasing the pool of active SREBP1 that normally activates PPAR and causing impairment of pre-adipocyte differentiation. This defect can be rescued by treatment with troglitazone, a known PPAR ligand activating the adipogenic program..

Various degrees of insulin resistance are associated with these diseases. Several types of lipodystrophy have been characterized at the molecular genetic level, including Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) (2), partial lipodystrophy with mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) (3), syndromes of partial lipodystrophy with cardiomyopathy (4) and Berardinelli to Seip congenital generalized lipodystrophy (5). In FPLD and MAD, lamin A/C mutations have been linked to disease (2,3), whereas a form of partial lipodystrophy associated with PPAR mutations has also been described (6). Berardinelli to Seip congenital generalized lipodystrophy is due to mutations of seipin, an endoplasmic reticulum protein (5). Other lipodystrophies are acquired or drug-induced, such as the lipodystrophy syndrome that is associated with the use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) (7) (reviewed in 1). In addition, progeroid syndromes such as Hutchinson to Gilford progeria (HGPS) and atypical Werner's syndrome (WS) show generalized lipodystrophy, often combined with insulin resistant diabetes mellitus (8 to 11)..

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	10	In recent years, two major players have emerged as being possibly involved in the pathogenesis of lipodystrophies. The first is lamin A/C, the nuclear lamina constituent mutated in FPLD and MAD cells (2,3) as well as in progeroid syndromes with lipodystrophy (8 to 11). Moreover, mutations of ZMPSTE 24, the metalloprotease involved in lamin A processing (12), cause diseases featuring a lipodystrophy phenotype such as MAD in humans (13), a MAD-resembling phenotype in knockout mice (14,15) and a HGPS (Markquardt, personal communication)..

In this context, it is noteworthy that mutations of PPAR transcription factor, which is transcribed downstream of SREBP1 activation and mediates adipocyte differentiation (17), are responsible for other forms of partial lipodystrophy (6,18). Moreover, a single point mutation in the PPAR promoter has been recently associated with FPLD (19)..

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	14	Lamins A and C are nuclear lamina proteins obtained by alternative splicing of LMNA and are almost ubiquitously expressed in differentiated tissues (20). Before being assembled in the nuclear lamina, lamin A undergoes complex post-translational modifications including farnesylation of the C-terminus and protease cleavage (12,13,21). Farnesylation of pre-lamin A is necessary for the following steps of protein cleavage, as metalloproteases fail to bind non-farnesylated lamin A sequence (15). Mature lamin A forms a heterodimeric complex with lamin C (22), which appears to play structural and functional roles, not completely elucidated (20). Lamin A/C interacts with lamin B and emerin (23) as well as constituents of the nuclear matrix including lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) 2 alpha (24), nuclear actin (25,26), transcription factor E2F and protein Rb (27). An increasing number of LMNA mutations give rise to several diseases grouped under the definition of laminopathies, but characterized by different tissue-specific defects (28). Besides the earlier-mentioned disorders affecting adipose tissue and/or causing pre-mature aging, LMNA-linked disorders include autosomal-dominant Emery to Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (29), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (30), dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system disease (31) affecting skeletal and/or cardiac muscle and other diseases affecting different tissues such as Charcot to Marie to Tooth neuropathy type 2 (32). The pathogenesis of EDMD and other laminopathies has been extensively investigated in recent years (33 to 37) and there is circumstantial evidence that lamin A/C interaction with either nuclear envelope constituents or chromatin may be affected in the diseases (20,38 to 42)..

The human homolog of ADD1, SREBP1, plays a major role in the control of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, whereas a closely related factor, SREBP2, is mostly related to cholesterol metabolism (46). SREBP1 is synthesized as an 125 kDa precursor and it is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Depletion of cholesterol causes proteolytic cleavage of the transcriptionally active N-terminal portion of SREBP1 from its position to allow translocation into the nucleus (47). A number of published data suggest that SREBP1 interacts with the nuclear envelope at an undefined site, while being transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear interior (48). Interestingly, SREBP1 and lamin A/C do interact in vitro (34), suggesting that alteration of their interplay may underlie the pathogenic mechanism of lipodystrophies. Recent evidence shows that impairment of SREBP1 accumulation inside the nucleus occurs in pre-adipocytes treated with an agent employed in HAART and causative of acquired lipodystrophy (7,16). Retention of SREBP1 at the nuclear envelope is observed under these experimental conditions, concomitant with anomalous accumulation of unprocessed lamin A at the nuclear rim (7). Downstream of SREBP1 retention at the nuclear envelope, activation of the transcription factor PPAR, which regulates adipocyte differentiation, is impaired (16), indicating a possible pathogenetic pathway for acquired lipodystrophy..

Our results show that pre-lamin A is processed to a reduced rate in FPLD, MAD and WS cells leading to precursor protein accumulation. Pre-lamin A is bound to SREBP1 at the nuclear rim, thus limiting translocation of the transcription factor to the nuclear interior. By using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes as a cellular model, we also show that forced pre-lamin A accumulation reduces the rate of DNA-bound SREBP1 and lowers PPAR expression. The downstream effects of reduced PPAR expression can be rescued by troglitazone (TZD) treatment..

The amount of lamin A precursor was increased in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts when compared with controls (wild-type or EDMD2 fibroblasts) (Fig. 1A), whereas lamin A/C and emerin amounts were not significantly changed (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis showed a statistically significant increase in pre-lamin A amount in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts when compared with control fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence labeling of pre-lamin A showed an intense nuclear rim staining in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts (Fig. 1C), whereas the precursor protein was hardly detectable in wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Moreover, a faint pre-lamin A staining was detected at the nuclear rim of R401C-mutated EDMD2 cells (Fig. 1C) and in other EDMD2 cell lines bearing five different LMNA mutations (data not shown). Intra-nuclear pre-lamin A-labeled structures were observed in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts (Fig. 1C, arrowheads). Mis-localization of pre-lamin A to intra-nuclear structures was observed in a percentage of EDMD2 cells (Fig. 1C) (data not shown). Emerin co-localized with pre-lamin A at the nuclear rim, whereas pre-lamin A-labeled intra-nuclear structures did not co-localize with emerin in lipodystrophy nuclei (Fig. 1C)..

An additional low molecular weight band was observed in mevinolin-treated controls and in FPLD, MAD and WS fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). In vivo binding of pre-lamin A to the active 68 kDa SREBP1 form was detected in control human fibroblasts following mevinolin-treatment (Fig. 3A) and in FPLD, MAD and WS fibroblasts either untreated (Fig. 3A) or after mevinolin administration (data not shown). Co-precipitation of SREBP1 and pre-lamin A was observed using either anti-pre-lamin A or anti-SREBP1 antibody to immunoprecipitate protein complexes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we failed to co-immunoprecipitate lamin A/C using anti-SREBP1 antibody (Fig. 3A). Moreover, lamin A/C was not co-precipitated by anti-pre-lamin A antibody (Fig. 3A). An emerin immunoprecipitation was performed as a control, which showed absence of co-precipitation of SREBP1 (Fig. 3A). These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-lamin A/C antibody (Fig. 3B). SREBP1 was not detected in the protein complex precipitated by anti-lamin A/C antibody (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that only in fibroblasts expressing high pre-lamin A levels, cross-reactivity of anti-lamin A/C antibody with pre-lamin A caused immunoprecipitation of pre-lamin A (and co-precipitation of a proportional amount of SREBP1) by anti-lamin A/C antibody (Fig. 3B). Figure 3C shows immunofluorescence labeling of SREBP1 in wild-type, MAD, FPLD, WS and EDMD2 fibroblasts. The transcription factor was localized inside the nucleus of control fibroblasts (wild-type and R401C EDMD2 fibroblasts) and a faint cytoplasmic labeling was observed (Fig. 3C). In MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts, nuclear rim staining was also observed (Fig. 3C)..

Densitometric analysis showed that the amount of activated SREBP1 recovered in the insoluble nuclear fraction was significantly increased in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes accumulating pre-lamin A (Fig. 4C)..

Faint SREBP1 bands were detected in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 5), whereas the 68 kDa cleaved protein only was recovered in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 to 4 and 6 to 8). In untreated nuclei, the 68 kDa active SREBP1 form was almost completely solubilized after DNase treatment (Fig. 4B, lane 3), whereas SREBP1 band was hardly detectable in the insoluble nuclear fraction (Fig. 4B, lane 4).

In untreated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (Fig. 5A), SREBP1 localized inside the nucleus (Fig. 5A). In mevinolin-treated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, co-localization of SREBP1 and pre-lamin A at the nuclear rim was observed (Fig. 5A). In untreated nuclei from control fibroblasts (wild-type or EDMD2 fibroblasts), SREBP1 localized at the nuclear interior, whereas the transcription factor was also observed at the nuclear rim of MAD and FPLD fibroblasts (Fig. 5B). To support the evidence of SREBP1 retention in the nuclear insoluble fraction by pre-lamin A, in situ-DNase extraction was performed. Following DNase-digestion, SREBP1 was hardly detectable in the nuclei of 3T3-L1 cells which did not undergo mevinolin treatment, yet it was retained at the nuclear rim of mevinolin-treated pre-adipocytes, where it co-localized with pre-lamin A (Fig. 5C). SREBP1 labeling was almost undetectable in wild-type and EDMD2 fibroblasts following DNase treatment, whereas it was observed at the nuclear rim of DNase-extracted MAD and FPLD fibroblasts (Fig. 5D)..

To rule out the possibility that mevinolin could interfere with cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, pre-lamin A accumulation was also obtained using the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 or by transfecting cell cultures with an uncleavable pre-lamin A mutant (as described subsequently). PPAR expression was strongly reduced in mevinolin-treated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, as determined by western blot (Fig. 6A) and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 6B).

To support this observation, we transiently transfected 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes with a FLAG-tagged lamin A construct overexpressing an uncleavable L648R mutated pre-lamin A: PPAR was downregulated in the nuclei accumulating FLAG to L648R pre-lamin A (Fig. 6B and C). Overexpression of wild-type FLAG to lamin A (FLAG to LA) was also effective in reducing PPAR level (Fig. 6B and C), whereas PPAR expression was not lowered in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing the full-length emerin protein, here used as a control (Fig. 6B and C). Statistical evaluation of these results showed that the percentage of PPAR-labeled nuclei was significantly reduced in cells accumulating pre-lamin A (Fig. 6C).

In MAD, FPLD and WS cells, we observed an accumulation of the lamin A precursor. Interestingly, the amount of pre-lamin A was not increased in EDMD2 fibroblast cell lines, indicating that impairment of lamin A precursor maturation is specifically associated with lipodystrophy-linked lamin A mutations. However, the reason why lamin A processing is selectively affected by R482L, R527H and S143F LMNA mutations is not obvious. At present, we can rule out the possibility of altered interplay between pre-lamin A and farnesyltransferases. In fact, mevinolin treatment was effective in increasing mutated pre-lamin A amount in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts, suggesting that farnesylation of pre-lamin A is an ongoing mechanism in these cells (MAD being a recessive disease model, only expressing mutated lamin A). On the other hand, altered interaction of mutated pre-lamin A with ZPMSTE 24 endoprotease might affect protein processing. It is noteworthy that ZPMSTE 24 mutations lead to accumulation of pre-lamin A due to impaired cleavage of the farnesylated protein and cause MAD (13), HGPS (Markquardt, personal communication) and restrictive dermopathy (49) in humans and a MAD-resembling phenotype in mice (14,15)..

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	50	Because we had determined a link between pre-lamin A accumulation and LMNA-associated lipodystrophies, we decided to investigate whether pre-lamin A interacted with the transcription factor SREBP1, which mediates adipocyte differentiation (44). In vitro binding of SREBP1 to lamin A/C had been demonstrated by Lloyd et al. (34) and the site of interaction had been mapped between aminoacids 227 and 487 of SREBP1 N-terminus sequence (34). In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time in vivo binding of the lamin A precursor to SREBP1. As expected, the low-molecular-weight form of SREBP1 interacts with pre-lamin A, indicating involvement of the nuclear lamina protein in the localization of the active transcription factor. Interestingly, Lloyd et al. (34) performed a GST binding-assay with a lamin A peptide spanning aminoacids 389 to 664, which includes pre-lamin A C-terminal sequence. Thus, our results confirm that the whole unprocessed lamin A molecule is required for SREBP1 interaction in vivo. The previously suggested reduction of lamin A to SREBP1 binding affinity caused by R482 LMNA mutation (34) does not appear to affect in vivo interaction between pre-lamin A and SREBP1. This might be related to the increased availability of pre-lamin A in FPLD cells, which could overcome the reduced binding affinity caused by the mutation. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that a different aminoacid substitution (R482L instead of R482W) may differently affect protein interplay (42)..

These data and our present results support the view that SREBP1 to pre-lamin A interplay has a physiological role in the negative regulation of SREBP1 nuclear translocation in adipose tissue, so that excess accumulation of pre-lamin A selectively sequesters SREBP1 at the adipocyte nuclear envelope. On the other hand, pre-lamin A might play a positive regulation role for SREBP1 nuclear import in other cell types such as cardiac myocytes (36). In agreement with this hypothesis, pre-lamin A to SREBP1 interplay, which is potentially disrupted by some LMNA mutations causing AD-EDMD (34), might be involved in the nuclear import of the transcription factor in skeletal muscle cells..

On the other hand, pre-lamin A might play a positive regulation role for SREBP1 nuclear import in other cell types such as cardiac myocytes (36). In agreement with this hypothesis, pre-lamin A to SREBP1 interplay, which is potentially disrupted by some LMNA mutations causing AD-EDMD (34), might be involved in the nuclear import of the transcription factor in skeletal muscle cells..

Under these experimental conditions, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts show increased pre-lamin A level and reduced PPAR expression (7). These and our results strongly suggest that retention of SREBP1 at the nuclear rim of lipodystrophy cells is associated with the presence of increased pre-lamin A level, irrespective of the occurrence of LMNA mutations. In fact, the identification of a selective and stable interplay between pre-lamin A and SREBP1 helps to explain the pathophysiology of both acquired and inherited lipodystrophy, the latter due to either lamin A/C or ZMPSTE 24 mutations. Moreover, it is noteworthy that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (causing pre-lamin A accumulation) have been previously reported to impair adipocyte differentiation (51,52).

Downregulation of PPAR expression was obtained in pre-adipocytes accumulating the lamin A precursor either by mevinolin treatment or by overexpressing uncleavable pre-lamin A. Uncleavable mutants of lamin A have been shown to assemble and localize at the nuclear envelope with kinetics comparable with that of wild-type protein (53). The L648R-lamin A mutant did in fact localize at the nuclear envelope, where it could potentially bind SREBP1, as observed for de-farnesylated pre-lamin A. Interestingly, a reduced PPAR level was also observed in adipocytes accumulating wild-type FLAG to pre-lamin A. In the latter case, the increase of pre-lamin A level was directly attributable to overexpression of the exogenous protein. These results support the view that excess accumulation of pre-lamin A is sufficient to sequester an amount of SREBP1, even in the presence of mature lamin A. Thus, PPAR induction, a key step of adipocyte differentiation, may be altered in laminopathies featuring lipodystrophy, as already proposed for acquired lipodystrophies (7,16)..

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	68	As MAD is a recessive disease, one would expect pre-lamin A accumulation even in the heterozygous state, i.e. in a percentage of cells from parents of affected individuals bearing one mutated allele (3). We did not observe a significant increase of pre-lamin A amount in those cells. However, this study deserves further deepening, since we found that overexpression of R527H-mutated lamin A in transfected cells causes accumulation of mutated pre-lamin A (but not endogenous pre-lamin A) (data not shown). On the other hand, MAD phenotype is not observed in heterozygous individuals, strongly supporting the view that a threshold pre-lamin A level is required to activate the pathogenic mechanism. Regarding the pathophysiology of MAD and WS, two main questions need further investigation. The first is the effect elicited by the accumulation of lamin A precursor protein in osteoblasts. In fact, bone resorption of the extremities is a specific feature of MAD phenotype (3) and osteoporosis is also observed in WS patients (11) (though it might be related to the aging process featuring this disease). We are now addressing this problem by evaluating the effect of high pre-lamin A level in pre-osteocyte differentiation or survival. The other open question is the pathogenetic mechanism leading to a premature aging phenotype in MAD patients and mostly in WS patients. We suggest that this phenotype could be dependent both on an anomalous amount of pre-lamin A and on altered interaction between mutated lamin A/C and its nuclear binding partners..

DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   To investigate the cellular and molecular etiology of early onset torsion dystonia, we have established a Drosophila model of this disorder. Expression of mutant human torsinA deleted for a single glutamic acid residue (E HtorA), but not normal HtorA, elicits locomotor defects in Drosophila. As in mammalian systems, E HtorA in flies forms protein accumulations that localize to synaptic membranes, nuclei and endosomes. Various morphological defects at the neuromuscular junction in larvae expressing E HtorA were observed at the EM level, some of which resemble those recently reported for mutants with defects in TGF-ss signaling. These results together with the distribution patterns and localizations of E HtorA accumulations suggested that E HtorA could interfere with some aspect of TGF-ss signaling from synapses to endosomes or nuclei. Consistent with this possibility, neuronal overexpression of Drosophila or human Smad2, a downstream effector of the TGF-ss pathway, suppressed the behavioral and ultrastructural defects of E HtorA flies. These results raise the possibility that a defect in TGF-ss signaling might also underlie early onset torsion dystonia in humans..

DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Dystonia, the third most common movement disorder in humans, is characterized by sustained involuntary muscle contractions resulting in severe twisting movements and abnormal postures. Although there are a number of heritable forms of dystonia, the most common and severe form is early onset torsion dystonia, a neurological disorder affecting the central nervous system. It is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance. About 30 to 40% of heterozygotes manifest the disease with onset between 1 and 28 years of age (1 to 3). Although the cellular and molecular etiology of torsion dystonia is unknown, it is not associated with any obvious neurodegeneration (4,5). Recently, this form of dystonia has been linked to the DYT1 gene (6). The causative mutation is a 3 bp deletion that results in deletion of a glutamic acid (E302/303) residue near the C-terminus of the encoded protein, Torsin A (HtorA). Another study in a patient with early onset dystonia and early onset Parkinson disease with myoclonic features revealed the presence of an 18 bp deletion mutation in the DYT1 gene that resulted in deletion of six amino acids (F323 to Y328) in HtorA (7)..

Immunolocalization of HtorA expressed in transfected cell lines suggests that it is a lumenally oriented protein localized to the intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). E HtorA has been found in large spheroid intracellular structures that do not colocalize with ER markers (9). At the EM level, it was reported that E TorsinA was found in membrane whorls that may derive from ER (10). In addition, HtorA is localized in Lewy bodies in postmortem Parkinson disease patients (11,12). Expression of normal HtorA in cultured cells resulted in colocalization with various heat shock proteins and suppressed -synuclein aggregation. However, expression of E HtorA did not suppress -synuclein aggregation (13). Similarly, expression of normal HtorA suppressed polyglutamine-induced protein aggregation in Caenorhabditis elegans (14). These observations suggest that HtorA could function as a chaperone involved in the folding or processing of secreted or membrane proteins. The effects of the E mutation on HtorA functions are unknown although the dominant phenotype together with other observations suggests that the mutant protein has a dominant negative or gain-of-function mode of action. The basis of the variable penetrance of early onset torsion dystonia caused by E HtorA is still unclear. A  second-hit  model in which other genetic mutations or environmental factors increase the susceptibilities of individuals heterozygous for the E HtorA mutation has been proposed (9,15,16)..

Here, we have established a Drosophila model of early onset torsion dystonia that may increase our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for this disorder. Several lines of evidences from this study suggest that the behavioral and ultrastructural abnormalities observed in E HtorA-expressing flies involve impaired TGF-ss signaling.

A striking difference was apparent in the immunolocalization patterns of E HtorA compared with WT or FY HtorA (Fig. 1B to D).

These distribution patterns are similar to those that have been reported for expression of WT and mutant HtorA in transfected human cells cultured in vitro (10,23). Thus, the aberrant localization of the E HtorA into clusters can be recapitulated when expressed in vivo in Drosophila. When expression of WT, FY and E HtorA constructs was driven postsynaptically by the muscle-specific C57-Gal4 driver (24), the proteins showed distribution patterns similar to those in neurons (Fig. 3A and B).

By 6 days of age, 90% of E HtorA-expressing flies became severely incapacitated within 1 min of exposure to 38 degrees C exhibiting convulsive-like leg and wing movements suggestive of the aberrant muscle contractions and twisting movements seen in torsion dystonia patients, whereas the majority of WT HtorA-expressing flies and control flies aged up to 12 days retained locomotor control under the same conditions (Supplementary Material, Movie A and B).

The weaker phenotype of the flies expressing E HtorA in dopaminergic neurons compared with the pan-neurally expressing flies suggests that the early onset and more severe phenotype requires E HtorA expression in multiple types of neurons, which may include motor neurons..

We also observed some overlap between HtorA clusters and endosomes in the motor neuron nerve bundles (Fig. 3D) and in muscles (data not shown). In contrast, no overlap was observed between WT or 18 bp HtorA proteins and the endosomal markers detected by anti-HRA antiserum (data not shown). We examined the localization of E HtorA clusters at higher resolution using silver-enhanced immuno-EM analysis (Fig. 4). In E HtorA-expressing flies, silver-enhanced immunogold particles were observed to be associated with various cellular membranes at nerve terminals and in cell bodies. Examples of immunogold particles localized at a synapse, within the SSR, at the outer periphery of the nucleus, adjacent to mitochondria and inside the lumen of single- and double-membrane endosomes are shown in Figure 4A to C. In control experiments with larvae that did not express E HtorA incubated with anti-HtorA antibodies or with larvae that did express E HtorA incubated in the absence of anti-HtorA antibodies, we observed fewer than 10% of the total particles seen in the experimental analysis, confirming the specificity of silver-enhanced anti-HtorA particles. Similar subcellular distribution patterns were observed with either presynaptic or postsynaptic expression of E HtorA. The localization of E HtorA clusters in synaptic regions, at nuclei and at endosomes suggests that the mutant protein could affect synaptic structure and function by interfering with one or more signaling pathways from synapses to nuclei and/or endosomes or vice versa..

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	40	  In addition, expression of E HtorA also caused ultrastructural abnormalities at regions of synaptic contact (Fig. 6C to F). One such defect was the absence of synaptic vesicle pools near some synapses. Synapses in WT HtorA boutons were always surrounded by a pool of synaptic vesicles regardless of whether one or more presynaptic dense bodies (T-bars or  active zones ) were present (Fig. 6B1 to B6). However, about 12% of E HtorA synapses (23/183) were devoid of synaptic vesicle pools and surrounded instead by a discrete clear zone (Fig. 6C1 to C6). A second abnormality observed in synaptic regions was the presence of abnormal membrane structures that extended within synaptic vesicle pools (Fig. 6D; Table 1). The abnormal membrane structure extended across the bouton, interconnecting two dense bodies on opposite sides. We observed similar abnormal membrane structures in all E HtorA boutons examined. A third presynaptic abnormality was the presence of free dense bodies (Fig. 6E), which are clear in a high-magnification inset. Despite their morphological resemblance to presynaptic dense bodies, these structures were free at the presynaptic terminals rather than anchored to the synaptic membrane (Table 1). In addition, the boutons expressing E HtorA showed significantly increased synaptic density area compared with boutons expressing WT HtorA (Table 1). These structural defects at the synaptic terminals in E HtorA expressing boutons may account for the locomotor defects observed at elevated temperatures..

The phenotypes are not identical however, as mutations in wishful thinking (wit), which affects a type II BMP receptor causes additional synaptic defects including a decrease in levels of Fasciclin II and a distinctive detachment of synaptic membranes, which are not observed in larvae expressing E HtorA (Fig. 6 and data not shown). Those observations suggest that E HtorA expression might disrupt some part of the TGF-ss signaling pathway to interfere with proper synaptic development. As E HtorA clusters localized at synapses, SSR, endosomes and the nuclear periphery, it is possible that they disrupt trafficking of some components of TGF-ss signaling from synapses to endosomes or nuclei. Mad and dSmad2 are known transcriptional effectors of the TGF-ss pathway that regulates target gene expression to control cell proliferation (29), neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis (30) and synaptic plasticity in type I glutamatergic NMJs (26,27).

At the behavioral level, pan-neural expression of dSmad2 substantially rescued the locomotor defects caused by E HtorA; at 38 degrees C, these flies remained as active as controls (C155-Gal4/+) (Fig. 7A). However, under the same condition, Mad overexpression did not suppress the E HtorA behavioral defects. Pan-neural expression of dSmad2 alone had no effect on the flies compared with the control background (C155-Gal4/+) (Fig. 7B). Although E HtorA behavioral phenotypes were suppressed by dSmad2 overexpression, mutating one copy of dSmad2 to reduce the gene dosage up to 50% did not enhance the phenotypes (Fig. 7B).

Furthermore, we found that expression of human Smad2, a human homologues of dSmad2 (33), rescued behavioral abnormalities as does dSmad2 (Fig. 7).

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	47	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS Expression of {Delta}E HtorA... DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   The major goal of the present investigation was to develop a Drosophila model for early onset torsion dystonia. Our most significant finding is that expression of E HtorA but not WT HtorA either in the nervous system or in muscles of Drosophila results in severely impaired motor behavior. Affected flies exhibit loss of coordination, inability to stand upright, spasmodic activity, leg kicking and held out wings, all of which are reminiscent of the uncontrolled muscle contractions characteristic of early onset torsion dystonia in humans. Interestingly, the E HtorA-expressing flies manifest these behavioral abnormalities only upon acute exposure to 38 degrees C. This result is consistent with the proposed second-hit model to explain why only about 30 to 40% of individuals heterozygous for the DYT1 mutation develop the phenotypic manifestations of early onset torsion dystonia (9,15,16). According to this model, expression of the mutated E HtorA protein in heterozygous individuals predisposes them towards the disease state making these individuals susceptible to a second hit, such as exposure to some environmental stress or the presence of another genetic factor that triggers complete onset of the disease..

Similar to what has been observed in transfected human cells in culture (9,10), we found that E HtorA forms protein aggregates when expressed in Drosophila neurons or muscles (Figs 1 and 3). Localization of E HtorA protein clusters at the confocal microscopy level revealed that some of these clusters were associated with synaptic boutons particularly in the region of the SSR or colocalized with endosomal markers (Fig. 3). In addition to confirming the presence of E HtorA in SSR and in association with endosomes, immuno-EM studies demonstrated that E HtorA was also found associated with synaptic densities and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4). The subcellular localization of E HtorA raises the possibility that it could interfere with a signal transduction pathway between synapses and nuclei that is required for proper synaptic development and function..

The presence of free dense bodies was particularly intriguing because this phenotype has only previously been reported for mutations that perturb the TGF-ss signaling pathway. TGF-ss signaling pathways regulate many developmental and physiological processes both in vertebrates and invertebrates and perturbations in these signaling pathways have been implicated in a wide array of pathological conditions (34). Recent studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that proper development and plasticity of synaptic boutons in the larval NMJ is dependent on TGF-ss pathway, at least in part, by wit (26,27). Downregulation of TGF-ss receptors at synaptic terminals via endocytotic internalization appears to be an important mechanism for controlling synaptic plasticity (35). In addition, experimental evidence suggests that retrograde transport of signaling to endosomes containing the activated TGF-ss receptor/Smads complexes from synaptic terminal or membranes to cell body might also be an essential aspect of the TGF-ss signaling mechanism to control development and function of the synapses (27,36)..

This polymorphism modulates disease susceptibility and phenotype of human transmissible spongiform encyphalopathies, but the molecular mechanism by which these effects are mediated remains unclear. Here, we compared the misfolding pathway that leads to the formation of -sheet-rich oligomeric isoforms of the methionine 129 variant of PrP to that of the valine 129 variant. We provide evidence for differences in the folding behavior between the two variants at the early stages of oligomer formation. We show that Met129 has a higher propensity to form -sheet-rich oligomers, whereas Val129 has a higher tendency to fold into -helical-rich monomers. An equimolar mixture of both variants displayed an intermidate folding behavior. We show that the oligomers of both variants are initially a mixture of - and -rich conformers that evolve with time to an increasingly homogeneous -rich form. This maturation process, which involves no further change in proteinase K resistance, occurs more rapidly in the Met129 form than the Val129 form. Although the involvement of such -rich oligomers in prion pathogenesis is speculative, the misfolding behavior could, in part, explain the higher susceptibility of individuals that are methionine homozygote to both sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease..

These diseases have attracted considerable interest not only because of their unique biology but also because of the appearance of new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)1 (3), which appears to be caused by dietary exposure to the causative agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (4, 5). At the heart of disease pathogenesis lies a poorly understood structural rearrangement of PrP, a host-encoded glycoprotein of the nervous and lymphoid systems. The normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) undergoes a conversion that leads to the accumulation of an abnormal, conformationally altered isoform (PrPSc). According to the "protein-only" hypothesis of prion propagation, PrPSc is the principal or sole component of transmissible prions (6). PrPSc differs from PrPC by increased -sheet content, increased resistance to proteinase K, and an oligomeric rather than a monomeric state (7)..

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	8	The human PrP gene (PRNP) exists in two major allelic forms that encode either methionine or valine at codon 129, with allele frequencies of 0.63 and 0.37 in western European and American populations, respectively (8, 9). This polymorphism is a key determinant of susceptibility to sporadic (10) and acquired (8, 11) prion diseases and may affect age at onset (12 to 14). Based on the analysis of 300 sporadic CJD subjects, Parchi et al. (14) identified six distinct clinicopathological variants of sCJD, which appeared to be specified largely by the genotype at codon 129 and the physiochemical properties of PrPSc. More recently, an extensive analysis, which included the metal ion-dependent conformation of PrPSc, of a large number of sCJD cases showed that PrPSc types are associated with the residue encoded at codon 129, the duration of illness, and with neuropathological phenotype (15). PrPSc types 1 and 4 have so far been detected only in Met129 homozygotes, type 4 being uniquely associated with vCJD, type 3 in cases containing a Val129 allele, and type 2 in any PRNP codon 129 genotype (16). The codon 129 polymorphism seemed to modulate the pattern of neuropathology and the extent of lesions in sCJD, as shown in a study that involved 70 patients who died in France between 1994 and 1998 (17). Codon 129 polymorphism also has epistatic effects on the phenotypic effects of mutations elsewhere in the prion gene. For example, the Asp178 Gln mutation combined with a methionine at position 129 results in fatal familial insomnia (18). In contrast, the same mutation with a valine encoded at position 129 results in familial CJD (19). Similarly, Val129 homozygotes in association with the Phe198 Ser mutation predispose patients to the Indiana kindred variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (20). Furthermore, an increased prevalence of genotype Val/Val at the polymorphic site 129 has been described in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (21) and a shift in cognitive decline toward early age in carriers of PRNP129 Val/Val has been reported recently (22)..
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	9	Despite the clear importance of the polymorphism at codon 129 in the PRNP gene and its link to disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which these effects are mediated remain unclear. The in vitro, thermodynamic stability of recombinant PrP is not affected by the Met129 Val mutation or by other substitutions related to inherited human prion diseases (23). Structural studies, however, have shown evidence for hydrogen bonding between residues 128 and 178, which might provide a structural basis for the highly specific influence of polymorphism in position 129 on disease phenotype that segregates with Asp178 Gln (24). Molecular dynamic simulations of low pH-induced conformational conversion of PrP has provided further clues as to the role of residue 129 (25). In these simulations, Met129 seems to interact with Val122 leading to the recruitment of more N-proximal residues into an expanding -sheet. As a complementary approach, we have chosen to study the folding properties of the two PrP allelomorphs experimentally by examining the misfolding pathway that leads to the formation of -sheet-rich oligomeric isoforms (26). We show that PrP-Met129 has a higher propensity to form -sheet-rich oligomers, whereas PrP-Val129 has a higher tendency to fold into -helical-rich monomers. We also provide evidence that the dynamics of maturation of the oligomers differ between the two variants. The maturation process occurs over time at the expense of the -helical-like monomers at a faster rate for PrP-Met129 than for PrP-Val129. Once the oligomers from either allelomorph have been formed they show similar proteinase K resistance that does not change throughout the oligomer maturation process. The observed differences in the misfolding of PrP-Met129 and PrP-Val129 could explain the high susceptibility of individuals that are methionine homozygote to sporadic as well as variant CJD..

Purified proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm purity and identity. Omitting dithiothreitol from the buffer used to solubilize the inclusion bodies and allowing disulfide bond to form in the oxidizing environment of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography was found to yield a fully oxidized protein (see supplementary Fig. 1) that has characteristics of PrPC, such as a monomeric state, high -helical content, and proteinase K sensitivity. All the studies presented in this paper were performed on proteins that included a C-terminal His tag..

To dissect the in vitro folding pathway of prion protein misfolding we used SEC, dialysis, and CD. The denatured proteins (30 mg/ml) were injected onto a SEC column that had previously been equilibrated in 20 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 3.7, 1 M urea, and 0.02% sodium azide and eluted with the same buffer. The elution profile of the Met129 variant shows two major peaks and one minor peak (Fig. 1A). Peak I (terminology as given by Baskakov et al. (26)) eluted at 5.68 min and corresponded to high molecular weight aggregates (Fig. 1A). Peak II eluted at 6.54 min and corresponded to the oligomeric isoform, while peak III, which eluted at 9.08 min, had a similar retention time to monomeric protein (Fig. 1A). The elution profile of Val129 variant shows the same three peaks but in different proportions, with peak II eluting as a shoulder to peak I (Fig. 1B). To mimic a heterozygote situation of an individual that carries both alleles, we have analyzed the folding behavior in a 1:1 mixture of Met129 and Val129 (Fig. 1C). The elution profile of the equimolar mixture showed three peaks as seen before (Fig. 1C). Integration of the peaks in Fig. 1, A and B, revealed that less than 2% of the Val129 variant had formed oligomers under these rapid refolding conditions (within the first 10 min of the SEC elution) as compared with more than 70% in the case of Met129 (Fig. 1D). In addition, the percentage of monomeric population that was formed within 10 min was calculated to be about 66% for the Val129 variant but only 24% for the Met129 variant (Fig. 1D). Integration of the peaks in the equimolar mixture showed that the percentage of oligomeric form was reduced to about 44%, corresponding to 30% reduction in the amount of oligomers as compared with the situation of the Met129 alone (Fig. 1D). Also the amount of the monomeric population in the mixture 1:1 increased by about 17% when compared with that of the Met129 alone (Fig. 1D). The monomeric forms of Met129 and Val129 variants yielded CD spectra with two minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of a predominantly -helical conformation (data not shown). The CD spectra of protein from peak II of PrP-Met129 and peaks I and II of PrP-Val129 did not give clear information about the protein conformations but suggested that these fractions were composed of a mixture of -helical and -sheet forms..

Similar results were obtained with a mixture (1:1) of Met129 and Val129 (data not shown).

The disappearance of aggregated proteins from peak I occurred more rapidly in the Met129 variant than in the Val129 variant, which suggests that, under oligomer-promoting conditions, the aggregated material from PrP-Met129 has a higher propensity to convert into oligomer than aggregated protein from PrP-Val129. To test this, we took aggregated proteins from peak I of PrP-Met129 and PP-Val129 from SEC at time 0 and monitored their evolution over time by re-injecting them onto the same SEC. Time course comparison between the two allelomorphes clearly demonstrated the higher propensity of the Met129 variant to oligomerize than the Val129 variant (see supplementary Fig. 2). Virtually all aggregated PrP-Met129 converted into oligomeric isoforms over a period of 12 days, whereas a substantial amount of PrP-Val129 remained as aggregates. To investigate the behavior of monomeric species in peak III under the same oligomeric-promoting conditions, we compared the rate of oligomerization of the Met129 variant to that of the Val129 variant collected from SEC at time 0.

The high oligomerization propensity of the methionine variant becomes even more apparent under the highest protein concentration and rapid refolding conditions.

RP-HPLC analysis showed that reduced forms of recombinant mouse PrP existed in multiple -sheet-rich isoforms with distinct retention times (30, 31). Accordingly, we used RP-HPLC to investigate the effect of the residue encoded at codon 129 on the composition of the oligomer population that eluted from SEC in peak II. Aliquots of this fraction were incubated at room temperature in SEC elution buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 3.7, 1 M urea, and 0.02% sodium azide) and analyzed at various times (Fig. 3). After 2 days of incubation, the RP chromatogram of PrP-Met129 showed two peaks with distinct retention times (Fig. 3A); however, for PrP-Val129 only one major peak was observed (Fig. 3B). A second peak could be seen only after 12 days of incubation. The two peaks were designated IIa and IIb, with shorter and longer retention times, respectively. To rule out the possibility that the two peaks represented unexpected modification to the proteins, we analyzed them by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). The deconvoluted mass spectra of PrP-Met129 IIa and PrP-Met129 IIb demonstrate that they represent proteins of the same molecular mass (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, the deconvoluted mass spectra of PrP-Val129 IIa and PrP-Val129 IIb showed that they also represented proteins with similar molecular masses (Fig. 4, C and D).

RP-HPLC analysis showed that reduced forms of recombinant mouse PrP existed in multiple -sheet-rich isoforms with distinct retention times (30, 31). Accordingly, we used RP-HPLC to investigate the effect of the residue encoded at codon 129 on the composition of the oligomer population that eluted from SEC in peak II. Aliquots of this fraction were incubated at room temperature in SEC elution buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 3.7, 1 M urea, and 0.02% sodium azide) and analyzed at various times (Fig. 3). After 2 days of incubation, the RP chromatogram of PrP-Met129 showed two peaks with distinct retention times (Fig. 3A); however, for PrP-Val129 only one major peak was observed (Fig. 3B). A second peak could be seen only after 12 days of incubation. The two peaks were designated IIa and IIb, with shorter and longer retention times, respectively. To rule out the possibility that the two peaks represented unexpected modification to the proteins, we analyzed them by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). The deconvoluted mass spectra of PrP-Met129 IIa and PrP-Met129 IIb demonstrate that they represent proteins of the same molecular mass (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, the deconvoluted mass spectra of PrP-Val129 IIa and PrP-Val129 IIb showed that they also represented proteins with similar molecular masses (Fig. 4, C and D).

First, the proportions of the two forms of PrP-Met129 and PrP-Val129 were different; the proportion of protein eluting in peak IIa was higher for PrP-Met129 after 12 days of incubation (Fig. 3, A versus B), while for PrP-Val129 there was more protein that eluted in peak IIb. Second, the proportions of the two peaks changed over time at different rates for Met129 and Val129 variants. In particular, the proportion of protein eluting in peak IIb decreased at a higher rate in the oligomer of PrP-Met129 (Fig. 3A) than in the oligomer of PrP-Val129 (Fig. 3B). Peak IIb of the oligomer from both allelomorphs seemed to have a retention time similar to that of the corresponding -helical monomers. Because RP-HPLC uses differences in the hydrophobic properties to achieve separation between bio-molecules, it can be concluded that the protein population present in the highly retained peak IIb has more surface-exposed hydrophobic residues than the protein population present in peak IIa. Furthermore, the protein population present in peak IIb appears to undergo conversion to become recruited into the population that eluted in peak IIa. Over time, this conversion seemed to occur much quicker with PrP-Met129 than with PrP-Val129 (Fig. 3, A versus B)..

After 2 and 12 days of oligomerization, both allelomorphs had molecular masses that matched those predicted from the amino acid sequences. However, after 30 days of oligomerization, the deconvoluted mass spectra of both variants showed an additional species with a molecular mass that corresponded to the cleavage of the N-terminal two residues from the proteins (see supplementary Fig. 3). The two variants showed the same level of cleavage that increased over time to yield, 300 days later, proteins that were completely lacking two residues from the N terminus (see supplementary Fig. 3). The cleavage occurred in the peptide bond linking an aspartyl residue to a prolyl residue (Fig. 5F). The lability of Asp-Pro bonds under acidic conditions has been reported previously (32) and provides a simple explanation for our observation. The cleavage occurred at the same rate for both Met129 and Val129 variants and at a region of the N terminus that was PK-sensitive (see below) and, therefore, was unlikely to impact the differences that were observed during oligomerization of the two allelomorphs..

We therefore used limited PK digestion in combination with on-line capillary HPLC mass spectrometry to probe differences between Met129 and Val129 variants during oligomerization. After treatment for up to 60 min with a 1:24 ratio of PK to protein, capillary HPLC mass spectrometry demonstrated that digestion of the oligomers from both allelomorphs yielded a range of short peptides that eluted before 20 min (insets in Fig. 5, A and B) that were liberated from the N- and C-terminal His tag regions of the protein. The central and C-terminal domains remained intact and eluted after 20 min as two peaks from the reversed-phase column (insets in Fig. 5, A and B). These polypeptides separated into two peaks that started either from residues 117 or 135, respectively, as a result of differential cleavage within the hydrophobic region (Fig. 5F). Comparison of deconvoluted mass spectra of polypeptides starting at 117 between PrP-Met129 (Fig. 5A) and PrP-Val129 (Fig. 5B) oligomers showed three major PK-resistant cores with matching cleavage sites for each variant.

Starting from an unfolded state and when forced rapidly to adopt the oligomeric form under low pH and at high protein concentration, the Met129 variant clearly exhibited a preference for the oligomeric state, whereas the Val129 variant favored the -helical-rich, monomeric state. The apparent molecular mass of the oligomers from both PrP variants was estimated to be around 400 kDa, close to that reported previously (26). We have ruled out the possibility that the denatured starting protein contained any oligomeric forms of PrP by SEC analysis under denaturing conditions using 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, as elution buffer. Indeed the chromatograms showed only a monomeric population of both PrP variants (see supplementary Fig. 4). How then does residue 129 influence this folding behavior? The first clue can be derived from the solution structure of human PrP determined by NMR (35). Residue 129 lies within the first -strand (residues 128 to 131) in human PrP. Riek et al. (36) proposed that this short -sheet might be a "nucleation site" for a conformational transition from PrPC to PrPSc that could include the loops connecting the -sheet to the first helix. Prion peptide models have also indicated the possible involvement of the region containing the first -strand in the conformational switch of PrP (37, 38). To our knowledge there is no published structure of the Val129 variant of human PrP; however, molecular dynamic simulations of Syrian hamster PrP90 to 231 at neutral pH showed that when a valine residue was present at position 129 instead of a methionine residue, the proportion of protein with a three-stranded, antiparallel -sheet structure increased from 0 to 23% (39). The three -strands spanned residues 115 to 116, 119 to 122, and 129 to 130 without affecting the thermodynamic stability of PrP, as was demonstrated experimentally (23). Molecular dynamic simulations of Syrian hamster PrP109 to 219 at low pH revealed that regions around -strand 1 and -strand 2 were potential sites for conversion to -structures (25). In particular, the first -strand served as a structural nucleus for the formation of new, and propagation of existing, -like structures (25). The interactions between Met129 and Val122 and between Tyr128 and Tyr162 illustrated the role of tertiary interactions between side chains nucleating secondary structure formation, as has been observed for helix formation in barnase (40)..

It has been shown that folding of recombinant, murine prion protein into -helix-rich conformation is extremely rapid (41) and is under kinetic control (28). We show in this work that the propensity of recombinant human prion protein to fold into monomeric -helical-rich population is increased when residue 129 was occupied by a valine. However, when the same position is occupied by methionine a tendency for oligomerization can be observed, with comparatively little monomeric -helical-rich population. These differences in folding behavior can be explained by a fundamental event in protein folding, which is driven by a small number of specific residues involved in the formation of a well defined, specific nucleus that then allows the rest of the structure to coalesce efficiently around it (42, 43). The high -sheet propensity of valine residues as compared with methionine residues (44, 45) makes PrP in which valine is present at residue 129 more favorable to adopt the native local -sheet that would temporarily stabilize the Val129 allelomorph in the monomeric -helical PrP..

These differences were consistent with early events that were observed during the rapid misfolding process. That is, the proportion of oligomer subunits with hydrophobic properties resembling those of the -monomer was higher in PrP-Val129 than in the PrP-Met129. Over the course of several weeks of incubation, the oligomerization process in both variants occurred at the expense of the -helical-like population that became a substrate for oligomer recruitment (28, 46). The presence of the -helical-like species in the oligomer reflected the heterogeneous nature of this nonnative form of PrP. This finding was consistent with the previously published supra-molecular electrospray ionization mass spectrometry results (26). On the basis of these observations we propose a model (Fig. 6) that depicts the formation of non-native -oligomers in vitro. Under appropriate conditions (low pH and high protein concentration) the acquisition of this non-native form can happen from either denatured, aggregated, or native forms and involves two steps: a rapid oligomerization phase followed by a slow maturation phase characterized by a structural rearrangement of the oligomers.

We found that once oligomers from both allelomorphs are formed they show similar proteinase K resistance that does not change throughout the oligomer maturation process. This indicates that if one relies solely on PK digestion to investigate PrP conformations, one could miss the detection of dynamic conformational changes influenced by the polymorphism at codon 129 in human PrP during disease pathogenesis. A similar PK cleavage site (starting at residue 117) in the protease-resistant core of the oligomers from both human PrP variants has been reported for recombinant mouse PrP23 to 231 (47).

Worldwide PRNP haplotype diversity and coding allele frequencies suggest that strong balancing selection at this locus occurred during the evolution of modern human and made heterozygosity at PRNP a significant selective advantage (53). Our data could provide a mechanism based on prion protein folding properties as an additional selective pressure against, particularly, Met129 homozygosity..

Notably, the pattern of PrPres distribution in the brainstem was different from that previously described for scrapie and consistent in all seven animals. Moreover, the profile of the electrophoretic mobility of PrPres after proteinase K treatment was equivalent in all cases analysed but distinct from that observed for scrapie.

Scrapie is endemic in several European Union (EU) countries and has been recognized, as a disease identity, for over 250 years (McGowan, 1922). To date, there are no apparent clinical or epidemiological data linking scrapie to human disease. However, since it has been shown that sheep could be experimentally infected with BSE (Foster et al., 1993), the possibility has been raised that BSE could have been accidentally introduced in this species. This would constitute a grave problem in terms of public health, since, in contrast to scrapie, BSE has been directly linked with a new form of CJD (Bruce et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996). Furthermore, it has been proposed that like scrapie, BSE in sheep could be naturally transmitted and thus become endemic (Foster et al., 2001). Clinically both diseases are indistinguishable (Foster et al., 2001). These possibilities prompted the EU to implement a surveillance scheme for scrapie in small ruminants..

All the cases that tested positive by the rapid test had been selected for human consumption. These cases were analysed further for the presence of vacuolation by histopathology, for the deposition of PrPres by immunohistochemistry and for the analysis of the PrPres electrophoretic profile by Western immunoblotting, and the Prnp (codons 136, 154 and 171) genotypes were also determined. Brainstems were divided sagittally with one half frozen for rapid test analysis, Western immunoblotting and DNA extraction, and the other half fixed in 10 % saline formalin and processed for routine paraffin histology. For immunohistochemistry, three anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies, 2G11 (Institute Pourquier-Farmoquil), SAF84 (SPI-bio) and L42 (RIDA; R-Biopharm), were used in three confirmatory independent assays essentially as previously described (Orge et al., 2000). For 2G11, sections were pretreated with formic acid followed by autoclaving. In the case of SAF84 and L42, sections were, in addition to formic acid treatment, pretreated with proteinase K as described previously (Bencsik et al., 2001; Hardt et al., 2000). The specificity of PrPres immunolabelling was controlled using sections from known scrapie-positive [kindly supplied by the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) archive] and scrapie-negative cases. For Western immunoblotting analysis of PrPres, frozen brainstem tissue was processed according to a new protocol from Bio-Rad developed for ovine tissues. For Prnp genotyping, genomic DNA extracted from frozen brainstem tissue was subjected to PCR with Prnp specific primers (upper and lower primers: 321 to 340 and 572 to 590 nt, respectively, according to GenBank accession no. AF180389) to yield an amplicon that encompassed codons 136, 154 and 171. PCR products were then submitted to automated cycle sequencing in both orientations using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer)..

0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	10	As a result of the rapid test screening, seven sheep slaughtered for human consumption that tested positive for the presence of PrPres (Table 1) were confirmed for the deposition of PrPres in the brainstem at the level of the obex, both by us and the VLA despite the absence of obvious vacuolation. All cases showed the same granular PrPres deposition in the neuropil of the spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (STN V) (Fig. 1b, e, h and k). Remarkably, no PrPres deposition could be detected in the neuropil of the dorsal vagal nucleus (DVN) (Fig. 1a, d, g and j), which is the neuronal nucleus that is always associated with PrPres deposition in scrapie. In three sheep (Table 1; cases 4, 6 and 7), focal granular immunostaining in the neuropil of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) was also observed (Fig. 1c, f and i). This distribution is unusual because of the consistent absence of detectable PrPres in the DVN and the deposition in the STN V. In scrapie, it has been extensively reported that the DVN is the first CNS nucleus to show vacuolation and PrPres deposition (Andreoletti et al., 2000; Ligios et al., 2002; Ryder et al., 2001; van Keulen et al., 1995; Wood et al., 1997), hence, is the elected nucleus used for routine diagnosis. Thus, the distribution of PrPres deposition obtained with three different anti-PrP specific antibodies was atypical in all seven cases reported here. Recently, scrapie cases have been reported that also diverged phenotypically from typical scrapie (Benestad et al., 2003; Buschmann et al., 2004). In particular, in several atypical scrapie cases that have been reported in Norway, PrPres deposition was observed in the cerebellum, midbrain and cerebral cortex, but no PrPres could be detected in the obex region (Benestad et al., 2003). In these cases, designated Nor98, although inconsistently, PrPres deposition was also detected in the STN V. These findings are consistent with those described here in that no PrPres could be detected in the DVN..
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	11	As a result of the rapid test screening, seven sheep slaughtered for human consumption that tested positive for the presence of PrPres (Table 1) were confirmed for the deposition of PrPres in the brainstem at the level of the obex, both by us and the VLA despite the absence of obvious vacuolation. All cases showed the same granular PrPres deposition in the neuropil of the spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (STN V) (Fig. 1b, e, h and k). Remarkably, no PrPres deposition could be detected in the neuropil of the dorsal vagal nucleus (DVN) (Fig. 1a, d, g and j), which is the neuronal nucleus that is always associated with PrPres deposition in scrapie. In three sheep (Table 1; cases 4, 6 and 7), focal granular immunostaining in the neuropil of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) was also observed (Fig. 1c, f and i). This distribution is unusual because of the consistent absence of detectable PrPres in the DVN and the deposition in the STN V. In scrapie, it has been extensively reported that the DVN is the first CNS nucleus to show vacuolation and PrPres deposition (Andreoletti et al., 2000; Ligios et al., 2002; Ryder et al., 2001; van Keulen et al., 1995; Wood et al., 1997), hence, is the elected nucleus used for routine diagnosis. Thus, the distribution of PrPres deposition obtained with three different anti-PrP specific antibodies was atypical in all seven cases reported here. Recently, scrapie cases have been reported that also diverged phenotypically from typical scrapie (Benestad et al., 2003; Buschmann et al., 2004). In particular, in several atypical scrapie cases that have been reported in Norway, PrPres deposition was observed in the cerebellum, midbrain and cerebral cortex, but no PrPres could be detected in the obex region (Benestad et al., 2003). In these cases, designated Nor98, although inconsistently, PrPres deposition was also detected in the STN V.

Frozen brainstem tissue was pretreated with proteinase K and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for the detection of PrPres (Fig. 2a). We have analysed four of seven cases for which we had sufficient frozen brainstem tissue available. This analysis revealed that the profile of the PrPres electrophoretic mobility was equivalent in all cases and ranged from 30 to 12 kDa. This result was consistent with the observation that all seven cases presented the same pattern of PrPres distribution in the brainstem. Moreover, coherent with a putative atypical form of scrapie, the PrPres electrophoretic mobility in all cases analysed ranged from 30 to 12 kDa clearly distinct from that usually observed for scrapie, which ranges from 30 to 19 kDa (Fig. 2b) (Hope et al., 1999) and BSE in experimentally inoculated sheep, which ranges from 29 to 18 4 kDa (Stack et al., 2002).

Susceptibility to clinically apparent scrapie is determined by polymorphisms in Prnp, particularly at codons 136 (A, V or T), 154 (R or H) and 171 (Q, R, H or K). Genotypes with VRQ and ARQ alleles are linked to a higher susceptibility to scrapie, whereas, genotypes with AHQ and ARR alleles are linked to a lower susceptibility and increased resistance to scrapie (Billinis et al., 2004; Gombojav et al., 2003; Hunter, 1997). Under experimental conditions, polymorphisms in Prnp have also been shown to influence the transmission of BSE to sheep, with the allele ARQ being associated with a shorter incubation period and ARR with increased resistance (Foster et al., 2001). However, successful transmission of BSE by the intracerebral route to homozygous ARR sheep has been reported recently (Houston et al., 2003). As for Nor98 (Benestad et al., 2003) and other recently reported scrapie cases in Europe (Buschmann et al., 2004), the cases reported here can also be considered as atypical. Thus far, all cases of sheep with PrPres deposition in the CNS identified in Portugal are from sheep with no apparent clinical disease and came from flocks dispersed throughout the country. Notably, of the 30 269 sheep tested none showed a pattern of PrPres deposition coherent with typical scrapie. This finding is consistent with the fact that to date no clinical scrapie has been diagnosed in Portugal. Thus, it is not clear if the cases described in this study represent an endemic form of a prion disease in sheep not previously identified and not linked to any specific Prnp genotypes or represent a recently acquired new form of scrapie..

The occurrence of such a putative atypical scrapie strain, independently of the Prnp genotype, may be of significance for current EU sheep breeding programmes for selection of non-susceptible haplotypes. Furthermore, given the recent BSE epidemic in Portugal (Donnelly et al., 1999), and thus the geographical risk of transmission of BSE into sheep, a possible link to BSE cannot be excluded. Although, we cannot rule out the possibility of adaptation of BSE in sheep following natural transmission, the fact that the PrPres electrophoretic profile described for this putative atypical scrapie strain is distinct from that observed in BSE experimentally infected sheep, makes this link less probable..

REFERENCES   Farm animal genomics is of interest to a wide audience of researchers because of the utility derived from understanding how genomics and proteomics function in various organisms. Applications such as xenotransplantation, increased livestock productivity, bioengineering new materials, products and even fabrics are several reasons for thriving farm animal genome activity. Currently mined in rapidly growing data warehouses, completed genomes of chicken, fish and cows are available but are largely stored in decentralized data repositories. In this paper, we provide an informatics primer on farm animal bioinformatics and genome project resources which drive attention to the most recent advances in the field. We hope to provide individuals in biotechnology and in the farming industry with information on resources and updates concerning farm animal genome projects..

REFERENCES   The omics and bioinformatics Genomics is the scientific study of structure, function and interrelationships of both individual genes and the genome in its entirety (1). The field has evolved from identifying short nucleotide strings of DNA to the sequencing of an organism's complete genome. Current progress in genomics research has facilitated comprehensive mapping of the building blocks of biology (2). Ultimately, researchers hope to gain mastery over the fundamental description of cellular function at the DNA level (3). This would encompass gene regulation, in which proteins often regulate their own production or that of other proteins in a complex web of interactions. Databases can be developed to provide solutions to problems that people encounter when dealing with massive amounts of data. However, the abundance and growing complexity of the data tools and resources required for analysis are overwhelming (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/bioinformatics.html). The same is true of researchers focusing on the study of function and structure of proteins and protein to protein interactions..

Organization of the data into coding (genes) and non-coding sequences, in addition to organizing these data into databases for  DNA databases  and proteins (Table 1), is central for bioinformatics (6,8,9). Parsing the sequence of DNA or protein is a first step, followed by curation then analysis and sometimes re-curation based on the analysis. The presence of these databases and derivative search engines gave rise to programs, such as FASTA (10) and PSI-BLAST (11), which are DNA and protein sequence analysis tools, respectively (12). These tools facilitate searches for sequences that resemble one another and homologous relationship inferences. Utilization of similarity search programs, which operate on sequences, has helped in augmenting annotated databases, which house information about sequence domains.

The identification of numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) makes it possible for geneticists to find associations between certain genes and cow traits that will eventually lead to the production of superior-quality beef (36). After the completion of the September 2004 B.taurus draft assembly (Table 4), this genome has functioned as a vehicle for studies on non-primate and non-rodent genomes as well as in comparative genomics (37). Similar to the pig, the cow also serves as a good animal model for obesity, infectious diseases and female health (34,38)..

The focal point of interest in sheep is based on the quest to maximize sheep meat and cotton wool production. This sector of the corporate farming industry is so intent on this biotechnology project that AWI, Meat and Livestock Australia and nine other partners are investing $50 million into the Sheep Genome Project to ensure its completion (http://www.wool.com.au/LivePage.aspx?pageId=116). As a resource in biological science, researchers have mapped a subset of genes that have also been mapped in humans and mice (39). These studies have revealed the existence of mutations that yield phenotypes unique to the sheep, demonstrating that genetic analysis of the sheep can enhance our knowledge of biological pathways in other mammalian species (39,40).

Researchers have investigated the genome of zebrafish, medaka, pufferfish (Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and sticklebacks. The zebrafish genome has attracted the attention of various pharmaceutical and biotech companies owing to the ease with which scientists can use this fish to study the gene function (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/genome/genesandbody/hg05f006.html). The number of databases and informatics resources related to fish genomic study on the Internet is consistently growing (Table 6). Japanese researchers are interested in medakas from an evolutionary standpoint (40). Other fish genome sequences, such as the pufferfish genome are similar to the Fugu genome in size and are 7.5 times smaller than the human genome. This has led many to believe that the genes conserved between these two species would reveal the minimal number of genes required for a vertebrate organism (41). Further investigation of the Fugu genome supported this hypothesis and showed the ability of the Fugu genome to aid in the study of vertebrate functional non-coding sequences (41). Other studies of fish have focused on the stickleback, for its variable body shapes, ecology or its behavior (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/SticklebackSEQ.pdf). In general, fish genomic work is of interest to the commercial fish farming community. Based on transgenic studies, antifreeze protein and fish growth hormone have been introduced into fish genomes, creating fish with greater cold tolerance and faster growth rates (42)..

Then, they modified the gene to make its glowing properties twice as powerful. This gene, called EGFG (enhanced green fluorescent gene, was then inserted into a fertilized rabbit egg cell that eventually grew into Alba (Amanda onion). Debates about the project itself and about the practice of manipulating genes in animals for research have quickly arisen in the research community.

The NCBI provides the most comprehensive EST database for many farm animals. Tabulation of chicken EST information, including quantities of ESTs and their tissue sources can be found in the BBSRC ChickEST Database (http://chick.umist.ac.uk/) (45,46). ChickEST provides access to 339 000 Gallus ESTs, generated from 21 different embryonic and adult tissues. Cow EST information is available on ArkDB, Ensembl (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=9031) and the NCBI Cow genome EST. A collection of pig ESTs is also available through the pig EST database (http://pigest.genome.iastate.edu/index.html) (47) in two versions. The first version contains 14 000 EST sequences obtained from porcine whole embryo, term placenta, anterior pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary. The second, newer version of the database accommodates 99 000 pig ESTs. Pig sequence homology comparisons can be readily studied on the Iowa State University's website. However, database updates were carried out only until January 2002. Among farm animals, there is sparse information about rabbit ESTs. NCBI does not provide comprehensive EST information, with virtually no physical maps on the rabbit. However, NCBI is still the central source for information about rabbit ESTs, mining 2275 GenBank rabbit ESTs (dbEST release 082605)..

The foundation for this diversity lies in genetic governance of both how traits are expressed and the associated linkage maps. Genes mapped in some farm animals serve as  anchors  across the comparative maps of other species (39). Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) play a major role in farm animals and the related biotechnology industry, as they can further the identification of traits related to meat and milk production. A number of studies have been conducted to detect QTLs that can be used for determining gene variances (48,49). The third generation of sheep linkage map (50) contains 1062 loci (941 anonymous loci and 121 genes) and is a compilation of genotype data generated by 15 laboratories using the IMF population (http://rubens.its.unimelb.edu.au/~jillm/jill.htm). The ArkDB provides current summaries of linkage and cytogenetic map assignments, polymorphic marker details, PCR primers and two point linkage data (see Table 9). The ArkDB also is a major source for mapped sheep loci, with SheepBase containing almost 1500 loci. The Roslin Institute has developed the  resSpecies  (http://www.reSpecies.org/) database to study genetic linkage maps, QTLs, alleles and other markers (44,51). Bovine QTL databases are available from several sources (52,53). Various traits, such as milk yield and composition, are available along with QTL dot maps, which provide varied positional and statistical information. The pig QTL (http://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/) includes two release versions from NCBI in May 2004 and from NAGRP in December 2004.

Although a number of gene-based technological advances, such as the prediction of illnesses or adverse drug response are beneficial for commercial interests (54), many look to protect how genetic information is used. The corollary in human genomics is the recent Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005 (http://www.genome.gov/PolicyEthics/). This bill, which is pending in the US Congress, prohibits among other things  a health insurance issuer from: adjusting premiums on the basis of genetic information  (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN00306:@@@L and summ2=m and ). Concerns over such actions reveal the understanding by the US government that the use of human genomic data must be closely regulated in order to hinder any commercial abuses. Although genetic discrimination and health insurance might not be issues relevant to farm animal genomics, a great need exists to establish a similar legal framework for farm animals in order to ensure the proper use of farm animal genomic information..

However, it remains unclear whether different heterodimers, such as Myc/Max and Mad/Max, recognize the same or different target genes in vivo. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Myc target genes are also recognized by Mad1 in differentiated HL60 cells. We also substituted the complete basic region of Myc for the corresponding region of Mad. Wild-type c-Myc was then compared with c-Myc(Mad-BR) in oncogenic transformation, regulation of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, activation of chromosomal gene expression, and direct binding to chromosomal sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that the wild-type c-Myc and c-Myc/MadBR proteins have indistinguishable biological activity and target gene recognition in vivo. These data are consistent with a model in which Myc and Mad regulate a common set of target genes.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	7	The c-myc gene encodes a transcription factor, c-Myc, that dimerizes with Max to serve as a master regulator of cell growth, cell division, and cell differentiation in all metazoans (reviewed in Ref. 1). Mutations that disrupt the regulated expression of c-myc (or the related N-myc and L-myc genes) are common, causative lesions in many human and animal cancers (2). In addition to its prominent link to cancer, myc is also required for timely progression through the cell cycle and is an essential downstream effector of mitogenic signals (3-5). The Myc family proteins function as transactivators when assayed on reporter constructs containing consensus binding sites or when the Myc N terminus is tethered to DNA through a heterologous DNA binding domain (6, 7). Recognition of specific chromosomal targets primarily involves the basic region, which forms an extended -helix with helix 1 in the Max homodimer crystal structure (8, 9). Myc/Max heterodimers recognize a preferred consensus site ACCACGTGGT, although other related sites are also bound with varying affinity (10-12). The helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains dictate the highly specific dimerization of Myc with Max, which prevents dimerization with numerous other transcription factors that have related HLH1 and/or leucine zipper motifs (13). An increasing number of cellular targets for Myc/Max heterodimers have been defined (14) with compelling evidence that Myc protein can be cross-linked to target sites in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (15-18)..
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	8	More recently, the Max superfamily was extended to include the Mad and Mxi proteins that form alternate heterodimers with Max (reviewed in Ref. 19). Unlike Myc, Mad/Mxi proteins function as repressors of transcription and inhibitors of both cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (20-22). Mad/Max heterodimers recognize consensus binding sites in vitro that are indistinguishable from those recognized by Myc/Max, suggesting that these alternate Max complexes may activate and repress common target genes. Although this is an appealing model, there remains only limited evidence to support it. Whereas Myc protein is expressed in all proliferating cells, Mad protein expression is more restricted and primarily found in terminally differentiated cells (23-26). Thus, in mitogen-deprived cells where Myc levels are low, there is no evidence that Mad supplants Myc to repress target genes. Some specific gene promoters, tert and cyclinD2, have been shown to bind to Mad1 protein in vivo, using HL60 cells, which differentiate and express high enough levels of Mad protein to cross-link (16, 18). In undifferentiated cells that express Myc rather than Mad, Myc was bound to the same promoters, suggesting that Myc and Mad can bind sequentially to common promoters. However, these are isolated examples so far, and no other promoters were examined. Further support for antagonistic functions of Myc and Mad/Mxi comes from mouse gene knockout experiments in which Mad and Mxi knockouts exhibit minor hyperproliferative disorders or occasional tumors, suggesting that these genes can function as tumor suppressors (27-29). However, no homozygous mutations in mad or mxi genes have been found in human or animal cancers to establish any direct role for these proteins as tumor suppressors..
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	9	Previous studies compared Myc and Mxi/Mad binding with cellular promoters through either the introduction of Mad/Mxi1-specific amino acid substitutions into the Myc basic region or the complete substitution of the Mad1 basic/HLH/LZ region into Myc (30, 31). Since the basic region is responsible (when dimerized with Max) for the recognition of DNA sequence elements at chromosomal sites, it was suggested that these mutants would offer insight into Myc versus Mad/Mxi target gene recognition and biological function. One study noted a substantial decrease in the transforming activity of the Myc(Mxi1-BR) exchange mutants and a shift in the spectrum of genes regulated in human fibroblasts (30). From this, it was suggested that the biological activities of Myc and Mxi1 involve the regulation of both common and distinct sets of target genes governing diverse biological processes. A second study with a complete B/HLH/LZ exchange came to the different conclusion that DNA binding activity and target gene regulation in terms of cell proliferation were similar for the Myc and Mad1 proteins but that the induction of apoptosis was substantially different (31)..

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	11	We were interested in a comparison of target gene regulation and biological activities of the Myc and Mad/Mxi basic regions. In particular, we noted that the Mad/Mxi1 proteins lacked conserved basic residues in the N-terminal half of the basic region that are common to the three Myc family proteins but that Mad/Mxi proteins have several highly conserved basic amino acids farther toward the N terminus that are not found in Myc proteins. To assess the basic region of Mad/Mxi1 proteins, we constructed a hybrid Myc protein in which the entire basic region of Myc was exchanged for the corresponding region of Mad1 while retaining the Myc HLH/LZ domain. We find that this Myc(Mad-BR) hybrid protein has the ability to oncogenically transform cells, induce apoptosis, and regulate cellular promoters that is indistinguishable from that of Myc family proteins. We also showed that Mad1 protein can bind to several additional Myc target genes in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that there is no inherent structural difference between the Myc and Mad/Mxi1 basic regions that would promote the regulation of distinct sets of cellular target genes.

We analyzed the binding of Mad1 protein to a number of chromosomal Myc targets in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). We found that Mad1 protein could be efficiently cross-linked to the cad, cdk4, hsp60, mSHMT, and Id2 promoters in differentiated HL60 cells where Mad1 expression is induced, but not in the same cells before inducing differentiation where Mad1 is not expressed. All of these genes have been shown previously to bind to Myc in several different cell types. Nonspecific PCR amplification of DNA from the -globin gene, which does not bind to Myc, served as a negative control for normalization. These data add to the previous demonstration that Myc and Mad1 bind to the promoters of tert and cyclinD2 in logarithmically growing and differentiated cells, respectively (16, 18)..

To dissect the contribution of the basic DNA recognition domain alone, we decided to test the DNA binding activity of the Myc and Mad basic regions through functional assays. A comparison of the basic regions of the Myc and Mad/Mxi families is shown in Fig. 2. Both protein families have a bipartite basic region that extends ~20-25 amino acids N-terminal to helix 1. The only crystal structure from this gene family is of Max/Max homodimers in which the proximal basic residues are in a helical structure and have defined base contacts (8, 9). However, phosphorylation of serine 11 in Max inhibits DNA binding activity (35), indicating that amino acids distal to the basic region can dramatically influence its function. Both Myc and Mad/Mxi have 6 basic residues proximal to helix 1; however, the Mad/Mxi basic region extends over 19 amino acids, whereas the Myc basic region extends over only 13 amino acids. The Myc and Mad/Mxi basic regions are both bounded by proline or glycine, which are likely positions for a domain boundary. Given these structural considerations, we decided to test the Mad basic region function by exchanging 24 amino acids of mouse c-Myc with 21 amino acids of mouse Mad1, using an N-terminal proline as one boundary and an invariant leucine in helix 1 as the C-terminal boundary. Within the domain exchanged, 9 out of the 25 amino acids are identical or conservative substitutions..

To assess the ability of the two proteins to promote cell proliferation, we reconstituted Myc-null rat fibroblasts with each Myc protein and established that they were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3A). We then examined the cell morphology (Fig. 3B) and growth rate (Fig. 3C). Both WT c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) fully rescued the growth defect in Myc-null fibroblasts, giving doubling times of 18 and 19 h, respectively, which is equivalent to the doubling time (18 h) of the parental cells with WT c-myc genes. In contrast, the Myc-null fibroblasts have a doubling time of ~45 h. We also tested the relative fraction of cells in each phase of the cell cycle by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 4). When compared with the pronounced accumulation of cells in G1 in the Myc-null cells (69%), both c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) had an equivalent reduction in G1 fraction (52 and 50%), respectively. Cells reconstituted with c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) had similar increases in S phase cells (20 and 21% respectively) when compared with myc-null cells (11%). Thus, the Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) proteins rescue the cell cycle defect in Myc-null cells to an equivalent extent..

The morphology of the foci was indistinguishable between WT and the exchange mutant (data not shown). We conclude that the Mad basic region has an equivalent biological function to that of c-Myc.

The Myc-null cells were reconstituted with each protein using a long terminal repeat-driven reconstitution vector, which is sustained in expression when serum survival factors are withdrawn. This constitutive Myc expression induces apoptosis, unlike in the parental Rat1 (thioguanine-resistant (TGR) subclone) cells where Myc is down-regulated upon serum withdrawal. As reported previously, the Myc-null cells have no detectable apoptosis when starved in 0.1% serum for 24-48 h, whereas cells reconstituted with a constitutively expressed WT c-Myc protein exhibit a substantial amount of apoptosis (23%) as measured by the appearance of floating cells with a sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 4A). Notably, there was no difference in the fraction of cells that activated the apoptotic death program with WT c-Myc when compared with Myc(Mad-BR) (20%) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the basic region of Mad is capable of activating the same apoptotic pathway as that of the WT c-Myc protein..

To address this question more directly, we analyzed the expression of several target genes in reconstituted Myc-null fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). The expression of five different c-Myc target genes (hsp60, nm23, nucleolin, mSHMT, and cad) was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR, and all genes exhibited equivalent induction in response to both WT c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR). In each case, target gene expression is stimulated by ectopic Myc expression above the level in the Myc-null cells (Fig. 5A). gapdh levels were unchanged by ectopic Myc expression and were used as a negative control. A much more sensitive assay for the activation of chromosomal targets by c-Myc is the activation of the tert gene in primary human fibroblasts (36). The tert gene is tightly suppressed in primary cells and activated by ectopic Myc expression through the recruitment of TRRAP-containing chromatin modifying complexes (33). We found that both WT c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) activated the endogenous tert gene to the same extent (Fig. 5A, bottom panel)..

A, wild-type Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) regulate the same set of genes. Quantitative PCR was performed with cDNA synthesized on total RNA isolated from cells expressing the empty vector, Myc, or Myc(Mad-BR) proteins using radiolabeled oligonucleotides specific for the rat genes shown on the right. Quantitation of the PCR products was performed using an Amersham Biosciences phosphorimaging system. Numbers below a panel indicate the fold induction determined by dividing an hsp60, nm23, nucleolin, mSHMT, cad, or gapdh-specific signal by a corresponding gapdh-specific signal and by the ratio of these signals in the vector lane. B, wild-type Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) bind equivalently to the same chromosomal sites in rat fibroblasts. HO15.19 cells expressing empty vector (vector), WT c-Myc (indicated by Myc), and Myc(Mad-BR) were cross-linked and lysed, and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with c-Myc-specific (M) or Gal4-specific (G) antibodies followed by the reversal of the cross-linking and DNA isolation. Isolated DNA was used in PCR with radiolabeled oligonucleotides flanking Myc binding sites in the promoter of the genes indicated on the right side. For negative controls, two types of PCR were performed. The first used oligonucleotides flanking CACGTG sites that do not interact with c-Myc in the promoter of rat glucokinase gene (GLU). Another PCR was performed with oligonucleotides flanking a DNA region containing no CACGTG sites in the rat pcna gene. Quantitation of the PCR products was performed by using the Amersham Biosciences phosphorimaging system.

We analyzed the binding of Myc proteins to chromosomal promoters in reconstituted Myc-null cells, with cells that lack Myc protein as controls. Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antiserum or a control anti-GAL4 antiserum, and the immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the presence of four target genes (hsp60, nm23, nucleolin, and mshmt). For comparison, we analyzed a CACGTG site in the glucokinase gene, which does not bind to Myc and also the pcna gene, which lacks Myc binding sites (Fig. 5B). There was a reproducible enrichment (4-11-fold) of Myc target gene sequences in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitations in Myc-reconstituted cells when compared with the signal with the control anti-GAL4 antiserum. No similar enrichment was observed for the two genes that do not bind to Myc in vivo. Most significantly, the binding of the Myc(Mad-BR) protein to chromosomal promoters was indistinguishable from that of WT c-Myc. The small differences in signal between c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) for the specific experiment shown were not found reproducibly, and the signals for different genes were not consistently higher for one protein versus the other. No significant enrichment of any gene sequences was observed with the anti-Myc antiserum in the original Myc-null cells when compared with the anti-GAL4 control.

The precise fusion proteins that we analyzed and their resulting biological activities differ significantly from two previous reports (30, 31) that addressed similar questions.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	44	Our conclusions differ most significantly from a previous study by O'Hagan et al. (30) that attempted to create a Mxi-like basic region within Myc through the mutation of 2-4 amino acids in the Myc basic region to those found at the corresponding positions in Mxi (and Mad) proteins. The most disruptive mutation in this study was R357S (numbered from the human c-Myc initiation methionine), which changes one of the basic amino acids in Myc into a non-basic residue. It seems quite possible that target gene recognition by Myc is dependent on an extended set of basic amino acids within this region, and thus, this mutation debilitates Myc function. The basic region exchange used in our study included two additional basic amino acids farther toward the N terminus. We speculate that these amino acids provide important nonspecific DNA interactions with the phosphate backbone to increase target gene recognition in vivo. It is also possible that other conformational aspects of the Mad1 basic region are preserved in the more extended Mad/Myc exchange. This interpretation is supported by the partial restoration of transforming activity in the Myc(R357S/V361E) double mutant, which exchanges two positions of the Myc basic region with the corresponding residues from Mxi1 and Mad1 (30). The indistinguishable transforming and proliferative activity of the Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) exchange mutant in our study argues that the basic regions of Myc and Mad1 can recognize the same critical target genes in vivo..

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	46	Our findings also contrast a more recent report that the Myc and Mad1 B/HLH/LZ domains differ in apoptotic potential but not in proliferative activity (31). We find that the c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) proteins induce indistinguishable levels of apoptosis, implying that these two proteins activate or repress the same target genes that promote apoptosis in the absence of survival factors. The simplest explanation for the differences between the two studies is the potential contribution of the HLH/LZ domain to biological activity since our study exchanged only the extended basic region and not the entire DNA binding/Max dimerization domain. Structural studies imply that the helix 1 and loop domains can affect DNA binding activity (37, 38), although no differences in DNA binding between WT c-Myc and the Mad bHZ exchange were found using in vitro assays (31). Of more interest are reported differences in protein interactions with the HLH/LZ domains, where Myc can bind to Miz1 and Mad1 cannot (39). We also note a significant difference in the ability of the previously described bHZ exchange protein to rescue the growth defect in Myc-null cells. We find indistinguishable cell doubling times for Myc and Myc(Mad-BR), whereas the growth rate for the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange was less than for WT c-Myc (31). Even greater differences were found in the rescue of the cell cycle defect. In the Myc(MadbHZ) study, 48% of cells were in G1 for the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange when compared with 58% for Myc-null cells and 28-29% for both Myc reconstituted and parental Rat1 cells (31). Similarly, the S phase fraction was 25% for Myc-null, 43% for WT c-Myc, and 37% for Myc(MadbHZ). In contrast, we find indistinguishable profiles for G1-S-G2/M between Myc and Myc(Mad-BR), similar to the results for cell doubling time. Thus, the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange protein only rescues part of the growth defect in Myc-null cells. These differences between our study and the bHZ exchange study may be attributable to specific protein-protein interactions with the HLH and/or LZ domains rather than to any differences in target gene recognition. It is also possible that the defect in apoptosis noted in the Myc(MadbHZ) mutant is coupled to the defect in cell cycle rescue..

Since the endogenous Myc and Mad/Mxi proteins differ in antibody reactivity, it is impossible to provide an accurate quantitative assessment of the relative binding efficiency of each protein at individual targets, and it is also difficult to assess the activity of each protein once binding has occurred.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	50	Our data support a model in which Myc/Max and Mad/Max heterodimers recognize equivalent target genes in vivo. The primary biological difference between these complexes is their precise regulation and their recruitment of nuclear cofactors, i.e. activators versus repressors (reviewed in Ref. 19). Mad/Mxi family proteins are mainly expressed at distinct stages of development and differentiation, almost all of which are associated with growth arrest. An exception to this is the nearly ubiquitous expression of Mxi1 and the S phase-specific expression of Mad3. In addition, Mxi1-deficient primary cells have a higher colony-forming ability when plated at low density, suggesting an enhanced proliferative capacity (27). In contrast, Myc proteins are expressed in all dividing cells and repressed under virtually all growth arrest conditions. Thus, in many cells, target genes will be down-regulated in non-dividing cells by the absence of Myc activation but not through active repression by Mad/Mxi. Furthermore, we note that most Myc target genes are still expressed basally even in the complete absence of Myc, such as in Myc-null fibroblasts (33, 40). This Myc-independent target gene expression is likely due to promoter elements that bind other nuclear factors, and the Myc-dependent induction of its targets is usually quite modest (3-fold) in log phase cells (33, 40). One factor with a potential role in this system is Mnt, which is simultaneously expressed in dividing cells with Myc. Mnt can bind the Sin3A corepressor and block Myc function (41), and Mnt/Max complexes are significantly more abundant than Myc/Max complexes in nuclear extracts (26, 42). It is not known whether Mnt/Max heterodimers constitutively repress Myc target genes and act to down-regulate their expression when Myc is repressed. Moreover, induction of Mad/Mxi under conditions where Myc is already down-regulated may recruit additional repressive cofactors to shut down target gene promoters below their level of basal transcription. Yet another complication in this system is the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) transcription factor, which has been shown to bind to many Myc/Max binding sites under conditions when Myc is not expressed (43). Our data are consistent with a model in which all Myc target genes can be suppressed by Mad/Mxi when the latter proteins are induced in development and/or differentiation.     FOOTNOTES.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In prion diseases, the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is converted to an insoluble and protease-resistant abnormal isoform termed PrPSc. In different prion strains, PrPSc shows distinct sites of endogenous or exogenous proteolysis generating a core fragment named PrP27-30. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most frequent human prion disease, clinically presents with a variety of neurological signs. As yet, the clinical variability observed in sCJD has not been fully explained by molecular studies relating two major types of PrP27-30 with unglycosylated peptides of 21 (type 1) and 19 kDa (type 2) and the amino acid methionine or valine at position 129. Recently, smaller C-terminal fragments migrating at 12 and 13 kDa have been detected in different sCJD phenotypes, but their significance remains unclear. By using two-dimensional immunoblot with anti-PrP antibodies, we identified two novel groups of protease-resistant PrP fragments in sCJD brain tissues. All sCJD cases with type 1 PrP27-30, in addition to MM subjects with type 2 PrP27-30, were characterized by the presence of unglycosylated PrP fragments of 16-17 kDa. Conversely, brain homogenates from patients VV and MV with type 2 PrP27-30 contained fully glycosylated PrP fragments, which after deglycosylation migrated at 17.5-18 kDa. Interestingly, PrP species of 17.5-18 kDa matched deglycosylated forms of the C1 PrPC fragment and were associated with tissue PrP deposition as plaque-like aggregates or amyloid plaques. These data show the presence of multiple PrPSc conformations in sCJD and, in addition, shed new light on the correlation between sCJD phenotypes and disease-associated PrP molecules..

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are mammalian neurodegenerative diseases leading to rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction (1). They include sheep scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathies, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (1-3). In these disorders, the host cellular prion protein (PrPC)1 is converted to an abnormal conformer (PrPSc) biochemically characterized by detergent insolubility and relative resistance to protease treatment (4). Whereas PrPC is sensitive to proteinase K (PK) digestion, PrPSc is cleaved within the N-terminal region and generates N-terminally truncated species referred to as PrP 27-30 (5). PrPC and PrPSc undergo intracellular proteolytic cleavages with generation of distinct C-terminal fragments. PrPC is cleaved at amino acids 110/111 and 90, producing an 18-kDa fragment named C1 and a larger fragment of 20 kDa (6, 7). Conversely, PrPSc is cleaved within the N-flexible region with formation of a fragment referred to as C2, sharing its conformation with PrP27-30 (6, 7). Recently, C-terminal PrP fragments of 11-12 kDa and 12-13 kDa have been identified in iatrogenic (8) and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) (8, 9)..

However, there is concern that some sCJD cases could be secondary to environmental exposure, case-to-case transmission, or unnoticed food chain contamination, as suggested by the occurrence of atypical phenotypes, spatiotemporal disease clusters (12), and the increased incidence of the disorder recently observed in Switzerland (13). Because of the variability in clinical presentation, signs at evolution, and neuropathological changes, the disorder with the double eponym Creutzfeldt-Jakob should be properly called syndrome rather than disease. Different sCJD phenotypes largely correlate with the PRNP codon 129 genotype, a site of methionine or valine polymorphism, and distinct PrPSc types (14) currently classified according to the molecular mass of their PrP27-30 core fragment in turn reflect the tertiary structure of PrPSc. However, controversial results have been obtained by different authors who have proposed the classification of sCJD PrP27-30 into two (14) and four types (15). Two main limitations of these studies are (i) the use of a relatively crude technique of protein separation, such as SDS-PAGE, and (ii) the detection of PrP species with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal 109-112 epitope, which precludes the recognition of PrP molecules lacking this region..

The supernatant was stored at -80  degrees C, whereas the pellet was discarded. Detergent-insoluble fractions were obtained by 2 cycles of centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 90 min, as reported previously (17). Protease resistance was assayed by incubating sample aliquots containing 40  microg of total protein with 100  microg/ml of PK (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37  degrees C. The digestion was blocked by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 3 mM. The samples were deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were dissolved in sample buffer (3% SDS, 3% -mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min. An equivalent of 0.4 mg of wet tissue was loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) for 2 h at 60 V. The membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37  degrees C and incubated overnight at 4  degrees C with appropriate antibodies. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and PrP was visualized on autoradiography film (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences). The following anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies were used: 3F4, recognizing human PrP residues 109-112 (1:30000); 6H4, binding an epitope between amino acids 144-152 (Prionics, 1:5000), and SP-214, directed against the 214-231 sequence of human PrP (1:1000) (7)..

Immunoblot analysis of PrP27-30 in frontal cortex homogenates of sCJD subjects with type 1 (A-C, odd lanes) or type 2 PrPSc (A-C, even lanes), either untreated (-) or treated (+) with PNGase. PK-resistant PrP forms were detected on immunoblots with anti-PrP antibodies 3F4 (A), 6H4 (B), and SP-214 (C). The 6H4 antibody recognizes a 16-17-kDa unglycosylated C-terminal PrP fragment in association with type 1 PrP27-30 (B, lane 1) and an 18-kDa form in PNGase-treated samples from sCJD with type 2 PrP27-30 (B, lane 3). Lower truncated molecular mass PrP forms are detected on the immunoblot with SP-214, mostly in association with type 1 PrP27-30 (C).

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	29	Effect of pH on PrP27-30 and on Truncated PrP Fragments In a previous study, we observed that one type of PrPSc, detected in the classical form of sCJD, changes its conformation after exposure to acidic and basic pH values (18). This property, likely dependent on the presence of octapeptide repeats in the PrPSc molecule, enabled us to distinguish two PrPSc types that share an identical electrophoretic mobility after solubilization in lysis buffer at pH 7.4. Following immunoblot with 3F4, the PK-resistant fragment of 21 kDa, detected in 9 MM subjects and in 1 VV case, migrated slower at pH 5 as compared with the migration observed when samples were solubilized at pH 8 (Table I). In contrast, PrPSc migration was not consistently modified in 6 MM, 1 MV, and 1 VV cases with type 1 PrP27-30 and in all cases with type 2 PrP27-30. To further clarify the influence of the octapeptide region in determining sensitivity to pH, brain homogenates from each single case of the group sensitive to pH were exposed to consecutive PK digestions, first to acidic and subsequently to basic pH. As expected, the immunoblots with 6H4 showed that, at acidic pH, the main fragment migrated at 22.5 kDa, and following further digestion at pH 8, it was detected in a 20-kDa zone because of the effect of an additional cleavage. Immunoblots with SP-214, recognizing the 214-231 C-terminal sequence of human PrP, showed similar results (data not shown) thus suggesting that the 22.5 and 20 kDa bands differ at the N terminus and not at the C terminus. Conversely, the electrophoretic migration of the C-terminal fragment of 16-17 kDa was unaffected by serial acidic and basic digestion procedures (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2), confirming the role of the octapeptide region in conferring PrPSc susceptibility to conformational changes..

When analyzing PrPC in two dimensions, the customary di-, mono-, and unglycosylated bands of the protein, obtained after SDS-PAGE, are separated in several spots according to two independent features: the isoelectric point (which reflects the net charge) and the mobility (determined by the molecular mass). In addition, after two-dimensional separation, each spot can be assigned to glycosylated or unglycosylated species based on its shape, configuration, tail, and smear. Although the 6H4 antibody was unable to detect PrPC molecules after two-dimensional separation of control brain homogenates, the SP-214 monoclonal antibody revealed several glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP forms with faster migrating species being detected at 18 kDa, corresponding to unglycosylated C1 isoforms (Fig. 2A). Negative results obtained with 6H4 suggest that this antibody recognizes a conformational rather than a linear PrP epitope and that this epitope is lost after solubilization of PrP in high molar urea. After PNGase treatment, truncated PrPC glycoforms were all reduced into several spots migrating at 20- and 18-kDa zones (Fig. 2B), corresponding to PrP fragments referred to as C2 and C1, respectively. Differing from controls, each single homogenate of cortical areas, subcortical nuclei, and cerebellum from sCJD brains showed increased amounts of C2 (migrating at 21 kDa in cases with type 1 PrPSc and 19 kDa in those with type 2 PrPSc) and the presence of additional acidic PrP glycoforms and low molecular mass unglycosylated species. The composition, electrophoretic migration, and relative abundance of these PrP species were different among distinct sCJD subtypes. In particular, sCJD cases of all codon 129 genotypes with type 1 PrPSc were characterized by the increased expression of unglycosylated PrP forms in a 12-17-kDa zone as opposed to the low abundance of these species in the MM2 subjects and the prominence of low molecular mass acidic PrP glycoforms in MV2 and VV2 subtypes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, truncated PrP species observed in different sCJD subtypes were partially recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction from different brain areas (Fig. 3, A-C)..

These new fragments, detected in the mass interval between 16 and 18 kDa, showed two distinct and highly reproducible electrophoretic patterns, each segregating preferentially with type 1 or type 2 PrP27-30. The electrophoretic migration of these newly identified PK-resistant PrP products is, therefore, intermediate between the unglycosylated PrP27-30 fragment (which is currently used to classify molecular PrPSc types) and the 12-14 kDa PrP molecules observed in all sCJD subtypes and named CTF 12/13 (9). The immunoblot detection of low molecular mass PrP fragments in untreated whole brain homogenates from sCJD subjects indicates that such fragments are generated by an endogenous proteolytic mechanism. It should also be emphasized that the detergent insolubility of these molecules and the lack of shift in their apparent molecular weight after PK digestion support the view that these PrP species adopt a fully protease-resistant conformation in vivo..

This could result from diverse subcellular sites of formation or, alternatively, from the generation of PrP conformers from full-length and N-terminally truncated PrPC precursors. Furthermore, the identification of the 16-17- and 12-14-kDa forms in subjects of all genotypes with type 1 or MM with type 2 PrPSc suggests that the mechanism involved in the formation of these forms is not influenced by codon 129 and by the type of PrP27-30. Although the three classes of PrP fragments characterized in the present study show biochemical properties of pathological PrP, it remains to be determined if they maintain all of the biological properties of PrPSc..

The influence of several experimental conditions, including pH and EDTA concentration, on the conformation of type 1 PrPSc and, therefore, on its electrophoretic migration is well known (18, 19). On this basis, we propose the use of conventional Western blot with 6H4 antibody, which is able to detect an accompanying fragment of 16-17 kDa in all cases with type 1 PrPSc. Such a standardized molecular classification of sCJD would have major implications for epidemiological studies, whereas more sophisticated investigations, such as two-dimensional mapping and PrP sequencing, should be reserved for atypical cases..

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	52	To date, the existence of distinct strains of the agent responsible for human prion diseases has been difficult to explain with just the biochemical findings of two main PrP27-30 conformations and with microsequencing analyses showing two truncation patterns in sporadic, inherited, and acquired diseases (21). It is well known that glycans may play a role in the phenotypic determination of some prion conditions, and their role has been recently proposed to explain differences between sporadic fatal insomnia and MM2 sCJD, two conditions sharing PrP27-30 type and PRNP codon 129 (22). However, different glycosylation states of PrPSc cannot fully account for prion diversity. Recent transmission studies of sCJD to transgenic mice show three distinct incubation periods of different sCJD subtypes (23). In particular, inocula from subjects MM1 and MV1 have the same incubation times, and, therefore, these molecular types appear as a homogeneous group. MV2 and VV2 cases, when transmitted to mice with Val at position 129, induce the disease at the same post-inoculum intervals and thus suggesting similar biological properties of these sCJD strains. On the other hand, MM2 inocula show heterogeneous transmission properties and incubation times different from the above groups..

Although it is commonly believed that PrP27-30 has a major role in modulating sCJD phenotype, it would be of interest to learn whether different truncated PrPs are related to specific clinical and pathological traits. Previous studies have disclosed that an internal PrP fragment of 7-8 kDa detected in patients with P102L Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (7, 25) and a C-terminal fragment associated with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease due to E200K mutation (26) are toxic to neurons in combination with or in the absence of PrP expression (27, 28). Here we have found that a fully glycosylated PrP fragment, closely matching the C1 PrPC fragment, was associated with amyloid plaques in MV2 cases and plaque-like PrP deposits in VV2 subjects. On the contrary, C1 PrPSc was not observed in sCJD subtypes lacking extracellular PrP deposition. It is noteworthy to emphasize that we also determined2 the presence of C1 PrPSc in subjects with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a condition characterized by florid PrP amyloid plaques) as well as in the newly identified bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE) (3) but not in amyloid-free typical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Earlier studies have shown that C1 is a cell surface glycophosphoinositol-anchored protein starting at amino acid 110/111 in human neuroblastoma cells (6) and present under multiple truncation forms in brain tissue (17). According to our findings, it is conceivable that extracellular release of C1 PrPSc could be responsible for PrP deposition and aggregation, as observed in MV2 and VV2 sCJD subtypes. Altogether, these results show that PrP-truncated fragments may influence the disease phenotype of sCJD and that their characterization is important for the molecular definition of sCJD subtypes..

In all these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and in these cases the whole protein is deposited. In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in APP or presenilin 1 or 2 cause autosomal dominant disease and these are the substrate and proteases, respectively, which are responsible for the production of the deposited peptide, Ass. Thus, in all cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process. We briefly review this remarkably predictable biology, but also point out that it seems sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed to by genetic variability at the same loci, strongly suggesting that the quantity of the normal protein produced influences risk for the sporadic forms of the disease. The evidence for this assertion is strongest in Parkinson's disease (PD), where genetic variability in -synuclein expression affects risk of developing disease, although the oldest evidence for the notion that increased expression of normal sequence protein can lead to disease comes from the observation of Alzheimer's disease in trisomy 21 cases. From these observations, we make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in general..

The loci underlying the autosomal dominant forms of Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease (1), frontal temporal dementia (2) and Parkinson's disease have been identified (3). In each case, the underlying locus has encoded the protein that is often deposited in the disease. In Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, this is the prion protein: in frontal temporal dementia, it is tau, and in Parkinson's disease it is -synuclein. In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is a little more complex in that the deposited peptide, Ass, is derived from a fragment of the APP protein when metabolized by the -secretase complex: a key component of this complex are the presenilins and mutations in either APP or presenilin 1 or 2 can lead to disease (4 to 6)..

This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition..

It has long been recognized that homozygosity at codon 129 predisposes to sporadic disease, presumably because of the necessity of prion to prion interactions and symmetry considerations (9,10). However, in addition to this well-established risk, recent genetic data have shown that the prion haplotype confers additional risk to idiopathic disease (11), clearly suggesting that genetic variability in prion expression contributes to disease risk. While these genetic data do not establish whether high expressors or low expressors are more susceptible, and since prion knockout mice are completely resistant to disease (12), it is most parsimonious to expect that those who express high levels of prion protein, and are homozygotes at codon 129, are most susceptible to disease..

This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified. Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).

There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18). There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19). The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations. However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%. These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk. In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24)..

In Alzheimer's disease, where the deposited protein is a peptide fragment of the primary locus, mutations in the cleaving enzyme also lead to disease. These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown..

Here, we studied T cell responses in 21 initially allergic children who, after a milk-free period of >2 mo, had cow's milk reintroduced to their diet. Children who outgrew their allergy (tolerant children) had higher frequencies of circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells and decreased in vitro proliferative responses to bovine ss-lactoglobulin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared with children who maintained clinically active allergy. No significant difference in proliferative activity stimulated by the polyclonal mitogen phytohemagglutinin was observed between the two groups. Depletion of CD25+ cells from PBMCs of tolerant children led to a fivefold increase in in vitro proliferation against ss-lactoglobulin. This suggests that tolerance is associated with the appearance of circulating CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells that are capable of suppressing the effector T cells generated 1 wk after reintroduction of cow's milk. The suppressive function of the CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was shown to be partly cell contact dependent. Collectively, our study provides human data to suggest that mucosal induction of tolerance against dietary antigens is associated with the development of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells..

This mechanism may be explained by different T cell events such as anergy, clonal deletion, and induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells. For ethical reasons, the existence of oral tolerance in humans is mainly supported by circumstantial evidence. Thus, healthy individuals have hardly any hyperactivated T cells in their gut mucosa, very little mucosal IgG production, and only low levels of serum IgG antibodies to food antigens (1). Moreover, nasal antigen application or feeding experiments induced peripheral down-regulation of T cell responses in healthy individuals (2, 3)..

Nevertheless, recent studies in mice and humans have demonstrated that a novel transcription-repressor protein, FOXP3, is exclusively expressed by naturally occurring and induced CD4+CD25+ Treg cells (31 to 38)..

In addition, at least in mice, suppressive cytokines appear to be involved in the effector function of Treg cells (40, 41). It remains an open question whether one or more of these down-regulatory properties may be acquired by any naive CD4+ T cell in a normal peripheral immunostimulatory process..

Using depletion of CD25+ cells as a read-out test for the suppressive effect that the Treg subset exerts on effector T cells, we were able to show that children who had outgrown their allergy (i.e., are now tolerant against cow's milk allergens), developed a population of CD4+CD25+ T cells with regulatory function in their peripheral blood 1 wk after an in vivo milk challenge. This subset was numerically and functionally reduced in children who remained allergic to cow's milk. These results suggested mucosal induction of Treg cells in response to cow's milk proteins or, alternatively, that centrally generated Treg cells had become activated and expanded in children with outgrown food allergy..

To investigate whether the CD4+CD25+ subset in our PBMC cultures possessed regulatory capacity, we removed CD25+ T cells from the samples and performed in vitro stimulation with either ss-LG or the mitogen PHA (Fig. 4). Depleted PBMCs purified from blood obtained before in vivo milk challenge tended to show increased proliferation in the allergic group, perhaps reflecting a higher proliferative activity in these children (Fig. 4 A), but no statistically significant difference was obtained. 1 wk after the milk challenge, depleted PBMC cultures showed, on average, an almost fivefold increase in the proliferative activity against ss-LG in the tolerant group compared with only twofold in the allergic group (P  <  0.001), and there was moreover a significant increase (P  <  0.01) compared with the proliferative level after depletion before the in vivo challenge. (Note that the actual proliferation of undepleted PBMCs stimulated with ss-LG is shown in Fig. 3 A.) These results most likely reflected that, after a long period of milk-restricted diet, most ss-LG specific memory T cells were probable residing in the gut, whereas few were circulating. However, after the oral milk challenge specific T cells would become activated and expanded in GALT and subsequently appear in the circulation before homing back to the gut. Also, PHA tended to elicit augmented proliferation after depletion of CD25+ cells from PBMCs collected from the tolerant children 1 wk after the challenge, whereas no such enhancement was seen in unstimulated cultures (Fig. 4)..

However, it was notable that PBMCs from the tolerant group tended to show increased TGF-ss production after ss-LG stimulation when we compared the levels after and before the in vivo milk challenge (P = 0.27), and a similarly increased trend associated with tolerance was observed for IL-10 before the challenge when the two groups were compared (P = 0.14). Interestingly, the TGF-ss response was significantly decreased after challenge in the allergic group (P  <  0.03), although it tended to be higher than in the tolerant group before challenge (P = 0.08).

This suggested that the observed symptoms were most probably produced via cell-mediated immunity.

This result probably reflected that the patients with active allergy at this time point did not have a substantially larger number of circulating memory T cells specific for ss-LG than tolerant children. The avoidance of cow's milk proteins for at least 2 mo before the challenge might have reduced this number, and specific T cells activated in GALT and mesenteric LNs would presumably start homing back to the intestinal lamina propria during milk challenge.

Regrettably, we had no possibility to study the involvement of other inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 (39, 56)..

The reduced production of TGF-ss by ss-LG to stimulated PBMCs after the in vivo milk challenge in the allergic group (Fig. 6 A) is in line with a recent study by Perez-Machado et al. (58) which shows that T cells obtained from duodenal mucosa of food-allergic children had a decreased potential for TGF-ss production compared with healthy controls. Conversely, we found that PBMCs stimulated by ss-LG 1 wk after the in vivo challenge tended to show increased production of TGF-ss in children with outgrown allergy, which could have contributed to the observed suppressive effect on proliferation. The major source for IL-10 production in ss-LG to stimulated PBMC cultures in our experiments remains unknown, and the results obtained were inconclusive..

Because our study strongly suggests that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells reactive to dietary antigens can be induced via the gut, it will be of considerable interest to investigate whether exosomes released from the intestinal epithelium play a role in the development of such cells. We have previously obtained results indicative of a tolerance-inductive function of epithelial exosomes produced in the gut of experimental animals and therefore called these structures "tolerosomes" (60)..

Reliable comparisons of mouse prion strain properties can only be achieved after passage in genetically identical mice, as host prion protein sequence and genetic background are known to modulate prion disease phenotypes. While multiple prion strains have been identified in sheep scrapie and Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is thought to be caused by a single prion strain. Primary passage of BSE prions to different lines of inbred mice resulted in the propagation of two distinct PrPSc types, suggesting that two prion strains may have been isolated. To investigate this further, these isolates were subpassaged in a single line of inbred mice (SJL) and it was confirmed that two distinct prion strains had been identified. MRC1 was characterized by a short incubation time (110 plus or minus 3 days), a mono-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type and a generalized diffuse pattern of PrP-immunoreactive deposits, while MRC2 displayed a much longer incubation time (155 plus or minus 1 days), a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type and a distinct pattern of PrP-immunoreactive deposits and neuronal loss. These data indicate a crucial involvement of the host genome in modulating prion strain selection and propagation in mice. It is possible that multiple disease phenotypes may also be possible in BSE prion infection in humans and other animals..

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	4	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals. Prion diseases are characterized by their prolonged incubation periods and distinctive neuropathology, which includes an accumulation in affected brains of an abnormal isomer (PrPSc) of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc). The conversion of PrPc to PrPSc involves conformation change resulting in increased -sheet secondary structure (Pan et al., 1993) and is associated with detergent insolubility and the acquisition of partial resistance to protease digestion (Meyer et al., 1986). According to the protein-only hypothesis (Griffith, 1967), PrPSc is the principal, if not sole, component of the infectious agent (Prusiner, 1991)..

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	6	Multiple prion strains have been described that are distinguished by their incubation periods and patterns of neuropathology when passaged in inbred lines of mice, and these distinctive phenotypes are preserved on multiple passage in the same host (for review, see Bruce et al., 1992). The existence of prion strains challenges the protein-only hypothesis of prion propagation. However, it is clear that prion strains are associated with biochemical differences in PrPSc itself including differences in conformation (Hill et al., 1997, 2003; Bessen  and  Marsh, 1992, 1994; Collinge et al., 1996; Telling et al., 1996; Wadsworth et al., 1999), glycosylation (Hill et al., 1997, 2003; Collinge et al., 1996) and overall protease resistance (Kuczius  and  Groschup, 1999). That these strain-associated biochemical differences in PrPSc fragment sizes and glycoform ratios following proteolysis can be transmitted to PrP in an experimental host argues that they may be responsible for encoding strain diversity. While the precise nature of the molecular basis of prion strain diversity is unclear, that prion strains may be distinguished by the differing molecular mass of fragments following partial proteinase K digestion and by differing ratios of di-, mono- and unglycosylated PrPSc is clear. Using this approach, we described four common PrPSc types in humans (Collinge et al., 1996; Wadsworth et al., 1999; Hill et al., 2003). PrPSc types 1 to 3 are seen in sporadic and iatrogenic CJD, while type 4 PrPSc is exclusively associated with variant CJD (vCJD) and is associated with a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot (Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2003). This characteristic glycoform ratio is also seen in BSE-infected cattle brain and these observations, together with bioassay data from wild-type and transgenic mice and non-human primates, have proved critical in establishing a link between BSE and vCJD (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1997; Lasmezas et al., 1996; Collinge et al., 1996; Asante et al., 2002). This characteristic molecular signature of BSE-derived prion isolates is seen in all UK cattle BSE cases examined and, together with biological strain typing studies in inbred and transgenic mice, suggests that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1994, 2002; Collinge et al., 1996; Kuczius  and  Groschup, 1999; and our unpublished data). This molecular pattern, in additional to biological characteristics, is also maintained on transmission to other hosts such as domestic cat, sheep, macaque and other exotic animals, either by natural exposure or by experimental transmission (Bruce et al., 1994; Fraser et al., 1994; Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 1998; Lasmezas et al., 2001). Recent data from French and Italian screening programmes suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). We have also shown that on BSE transmission to a line of transgenic mice expressing only human PrP Met-129, Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35, two distinct molecular phenotypes can be produced: one that mirrors the vCJD phenotype with type 4 PrPSc and an additional molecular phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD with PrPSc type 2 (Asante et al., 2002). These transgenic mice were generated on a mixed genetic background, and one possibility was that the different patterns were determined by background effects in individual mice (Asante et al., 2002). This interpretation was supported by the demonstration that vCJD and BSE prions on primary passage to a series of inbred lines of mice were also able to produce two distinct molecular phenotypes on Western blotting, dependent only on the genetic background of the mice (Asante et al., 2002). These data argued that two distinct strains had been propagated from cattle BSE. However, since the parameters that distinguish prion strains (incubation time, neuropathology and PrPSc type) are also known to be modulated by host genetic background, these cannot be adequately compared after primary passage in different lines of inbred mice (Bruce, 1993; Moore et al., 1998; Somerville, 1999). We therefore subpassaged these mouse-adapted BSE prions in the same inbred mouse line to determine whether distinctive biological characteristics resulted, indicative of different strains, and whether these correlated with the different PrPSc types propagated in the animals..

Coding polymorphisms of the mouse prion protein gene (Prnp) are known to influence incubation time (Westaway et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1998) and therefore all mice tested were Prnpa (Leu-108, Thr-189). While BSE transmits readily to wild-type mice, there is nevertheless a substantial transmission barrier (Wells et al., 1998; Wadsworth et al., 2001), which results in long and variable incubation times and an incomplete attack rate on primary passage (Hill et al., 1997; Asante et al., 2002) (Table 1) compared with the passage of mouse adapted-prions in mice. Primary passage of BSE prions in mice usually results in a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot that closely resembles the PrPSc types seen in cattle BSE and human vCJD (type 4) (Hill et al., 1997; Somerville et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996). Most of the inbred lines tested (C57BL/6JOlaHsd, FVB/NHsd, NZW/OlaHsd, SM/J and SWR/OlaHsd) corresponded to this pattern (Fig. 1 and unpublished data; Asante et al., 2002). However, two strains (SJL/OlaHsd and RIIIS/J) produced an alternative PrPSc type where the fragment sizes appeared the same but the glycoform ratios were different such that the mono-glycosylated glycoform was dominant (Fig. 1; Asante et al., 2002). Passage of cattle BSE (I783) in C57BL/6 mice gave, as reported previously, a prolonged incubation time (710 plus or minus 15 days); however, passage of cattle BSE (I783) in SJL mice gave a very much shorter incubation time (196 plus or minus 13 days) (Table 1; Asante et al., 2002). Neuropathological findings were unremarkable with only diffuse PrP staining in both inbred mouse lines (Asante et al., 2002). We also inoculated C57BL/6 mice with another cattle BSE inoculum (I038) (Collinge et al., 1996). On Western blots, both I783 and I038 show the same di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern (Fig. 1a), which has, to the best of our knowledge, been observed in all UK BSE cattle brain isolates reported to date. C57BL/6 mice inoculated with I038 did not show clinical signs of disease (0/12) at  > 839 days (Table 1; Collinge et al., 1996). However, I038 has been used in many transmissions in our laboratory and has transmitted efficiently with a consistent di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on Western blots following transmission to various lines of inbred mice (Fig. 1b; Hill et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1995, 1996)..

However, recent data from French and Italian cattle suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). Strain typing may be carried out in many ways (Safar et al., 1998; Peretz et al., 2002) but strains were originally defined and classified by their characteristics on passage to particular inbred lines of mice based on incubation time and patterns of neuropathological targeting, and more recently have been distinguished by PrPSc type on Western blots. A mouse prion strain difference should only be assessed in the same line of inbred mouse, as genetic background is known to modulate all the defining features of a prion strain (Bruce, 1993; Moore et al., 1998). Based on these criteria, we have isolated two distinct strains from cattle BSE, which we have designated MRC1 and MRC2, respectively. MRC1 showed a mono-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type on Western blots. It was derived from a primary BSE passage in SJL/OlaHsd mice and had a relatively short incubation time and a generalized diffuse pattern of PrP immunostaining in the brain. MRC2 shows a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type on Western blots, was derived from a primary BSE passage in C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice and had a relatively long incubation time and showed a distinctive pattern of PrP immunoreactivity and neuronal loss..
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	37	SJL mice were able to support both the MRC1 and MRC2 strain patterns. However, it will be important to establish whether these strains are stable on further passage in SJL and other strains of mice. Both C57BL/6 and SJL mice share the same PrP amino acid sequence and therefore the strain selection must be a feature of other genetic loci. Within the limits of resolution available from Western blotting, the fragment sizes following proteinase K digestion were the same for the PrPSc associated with both strains, raising the possibility that the differences related to glycosylation and not to gross conformational differences, at least as differentiated by proteinase K digestion. Additional studies will be required to characterize precisely the conformation and physico-chemical properties of PrPSc associated with these prion strains..

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	39	Although recent reports suggest that alternative strains of BSE can be found in cattle, previous studies have suggested that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Bruce et al., 1994; Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). 301V and 301C represent previously reported independent BSE strains; however, these were propagated in different strains of mice, which not only had very different genetic backgrounds (VM/Dk and C57) but also had two amino acid coding differences in PrP and therefore their  strain  characteristics cannot be directly compared. It is possible that MRC2 represents the same strain as 301C; however, formal comparisons will be required to investigate this..
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	40	The strain characteristics associated with MRC1 resemble those seen with passage of Chandler/RML scrapie in these strains of mice with respect to incubation time (122 plus or minus 1 days), histology and PrPSc type on Western blotting (unpublished data). We are confident that our findings are not the result of contamination with mouse scrapie as these transmissions were performed in accordance with rigorous biosafety protocols for preparation of inocula, inoculations and care of mice. Disposable equipment was used for each inoculum and each mouse was identified with a unique transponder. In addition, the MRC1 strain was also seen on primary passage to RIIIS mice and also on primary passage of vCJD to SJL mice (Asante et al., 2002). vCJD is caused by a BSE-like prion strain (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996); therefore, it is not surprising that the same phenomenon is seen with both vCJD and BSE prions in the same strains of mice. Further transmission studies are under way to characterize these vCJD-derived mouse strains. A similar bifurcation of the BSE strain characteristics was also observed with independent BSE inocula in transgenic mice expressing human PrP with methionine at codon 129, Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35 (Asante et al., 2002)..

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	42	MRC2 and MRC1 were derived from different sources of BSE prions, I038 and I783, respectively. I038 originated from a pool of five infected cow brainstems. However, our extensive transmission studies with these isolates excluded the pooling of material from five cows as the source of the strain variation that we observe in these transmissions. I038 gave the  classical  BSE signature and the novel phenotype was derived from I783, which originated from a single cow brain. I783 has been used for transmissions in several inbred lines of mice in our laboratory and consistently produces the MRC2 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in C57BL/6JOlaHsd, FVB/NHsd, NZW/OlaHsd, SM/J and SWR/OlaHsd mice. However, it also consistently produces the MRC1 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in SJL/OlaHsd and RIIIS/J mice (Fig. 1b, lane 3 and Asante et al., 2002). DNA sequence analysis of the bovine Prnp gene in I783 confirmed that the animal was homozygous for PrP amino acids, thereby excluding PrP heterozygosity as the source of the strain bifurcation. I038 and other independent BSE inocula have also been shown to produce two  strains' in Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35 transgenic mice, which are on a mixed genetic background. We therefore believe that the prion strain selection or  mutation  is a feature of the genetic background of the mice and studies are under way to identify the genes involved. Although recent data suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004), in this study, both I038 and I783 appeared to be the same single strain. However, Western blotting was unable to determine whether a mixed population of strains already existed in either of these brains or whether the alternative strains were generated de novo in the mice. The inbred lines studied to date represent only a small proportion of the allelic variation that exists in the mouse genome; therefore, the study of other strains of mice, particularly those derived from unrelated strains such as trapped wild mice, may reveal additional BSE-derived strains..

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We assessed the contribution of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) in the control of neuronal apoptosis by examining cell death in both human cells and murine primary cultured neurons. We first confirmed our previous finding that staurosporine-induced caspase activation is increased by PrPc overexpression in HEK293 cells. We show here that this phenotype is fully dependent on p53 and that the control of p53 activity by PrPc occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in human cells. Of most interest, we demonstrate that neuronal endogenous PrPc also controls a p53-dependent pro-apoptotic phenotype. Thus, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling)-positive cells were lower in primary cultured neurons derived from Zrch-1 mice embryos in which PrPc has been abrogated than in wild-type neurons. PrPc knock-out neurons also displayed drastically diminished caspase-3-like activity and immunoreactivity together with reduced p53 expression and transcriptional activity, a phenotype complemented in part by PrPc transfection. Interestingly, p53 expression was also reduced in the brain of adult Prnp-/- mice. Neuronal PrPc likely controls p53 at a post-transcriptional level because the deletion of cellular prion protein is accompanied by a higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity and reduced phosphorylated p38 MAPK expression. We therefore propose that the physiological function of endogenous cellular prion could be to regulate p53-dependent caspase-3-mediated neuronal cell death. This phenotype likely occurs through up-regulation of p53 promoter transactivation as well as downstream by controlling p53 stability via Mdm2 expression..
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We assessed the contribution of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) in the control of neuronal apoptosis by examining cell death in both human cells and murine primary cultured neurons. We first confirmed our previous finding that staurosporine-induced caspase activation is increased by PrPc overexpression in HEK293 cells. We show here that this phenotype is fully dependent on p53 and that the control of p53 activity by PrPc occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in human cells. Of most interest, we demonstrate that neuronal endogenous PrPc also controls a p53-dependent pro-apoptotic phenotype. Thus, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling)-positive cells were lower in primary cultured neurons derived from Zrch-1 mice embryos in which PrPc has been abrogated than in wild-type neurons. PrPc knock-out neurons also displayed drastically diminished caspase-3-like activity and immunoreactivity together with reduced p53 expression and transcriptional activity, a phenotype complemented in part by PrPc transfection. Interestingly, p53 expression was also reduced in the brain of adult Prnp-/- mice. Neuronal PrPc likely controls p53 at a post-transcriptional level because the deletion of cellular prion protein is accompanied by a higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity and reduced phosphorylated p38 MAPK expression.

These pathologies are not conventional, first because they appear to be caused mainly by a unique protein that bears the potential of transmissibility in infectious cases of these diseases. It is now widely admitted that transmission occurs independently of any accompanying nucleic acid or viral particles (1, 3). Second, and of most interest, was the demonstration that the scrapie (also called PrPres)1 is the highly protease-resistant conformer of a ubiquitous protein counterpart referred to as cellular prion protein (PrPc) (4, 5). Another striking aspect is that the host PrPc seems to act as a "substratum" for scrapie as demonstrated by the fact that in animals deficient in endogenous PrPc, highly infectious "scrapie-rich" inoculates fail to transmit the disease (6, 7). This observation is not fully understood at a molecular level, and the mechanisms by which PrPc is converted into scrapie remain a matter of speculation. Furthermore, this does not explain most of the sporadic cases that are characterized at late stages by spontaneous deposition of PrPres in the absence of exogenous "pathogenic" species..

In this respect, an interesting discussion revolving around cell death is ongoing, opening a new field of investigation. It is clear that apoptosis accompanies the late stages of the disease. Following that idea, several groups have set out to investigate the putative role of PrPc in the control of cell death. From a theoretical point of view, PrP could be antiapoptotic, and the disease could result in the abolition of this function. Alternatively, PrPc-related pathologies could be due to the exacerbation of a proapoptotic physiological phenotype associated with PrPc. Studies carried out on distinct cell types, with various methodologies and approaches, have led to somewhat opposite conclusions (8-12). Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of PrPc in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and TSM1 neurons as well as in an inducible cell line (Rov9) leads to increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli, reflected mainly by enhanced caspase-3 activity (13, 14). We further demonstrated that in TSM1 neurons, PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is associated with an up-regulation of p53 expression and transcriptional activity (14). This appears to be due to Mdm2-related post-transcriptional modification of p53 (14)..

The treatment of mock-transfected PrP+/+ neurons with staurosporine increases caspase-3-like immunoreactivity, a phenotype that was drastically enhanced in 3F4MoPrPc-transfected primary cultured neurons (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Accordingly, this was accompanied by a consistent elevation of staurosporine-induced caspase activation upon 3F4MoPrP transfection of PrP+/+ neurons (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that primary cultured neurons were transfectable and that 3F4MoPrPc overexpression in these cells mimics and potentiates the staurosporine-stimulated caspase activation phenotype observed in untransfected primary cultured neurons (see Fig. 5)..

After transient transfection of wild-type primary cultured neurons (PrP+/+) with 3F4MoPrPc cDNA or empty vector (pcDNA3), PrPc- and caspase-3-like (casp.3) immunoreactivities (A) and caspase activity (B) were measured under control (-) and staurosporine-stimulated (+) conditions (see "Materials and Methods" for details). Experiments in B correspond to three independent transfections with 3F4MoPrPc cDNA..
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	41	  We took advantage of this feature to examine whether the lowering of caspase activation observed in PrP-/- primary cultured neurons could be rescued even partially by 3F4MoPrPc overexpression. Fig. 7A shows that a PrPc-like immunoreactivity was detectable in 3F4MoPrPc-transfected PrP-/- neurons. This was accompanied by a partial but reproducible recovery of the staurosporine-induced caspase activation responsiveness displayed by PrP+/+ neurons (Fig. 7B). Thus, although mock-transfected PrP-/- display only 54% of the responsiveness of PrP+/+ neurons to staurosporine, three distinct 3F4MoPrP transfections of PrP-/- neurons consistently restored the staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation to about 81% of the control. (Fig. 7B). This incomplete rescue is in apparent agreement with the relatively low efficiency of 3F4MoPrP cDNA transfection illustrated by the expression of exogenous PrPc in PrP-/- primary cultured neurons and agrees well with all of the data described above..

Bars correspond to the staurosporine-induced increase of caspase-3 activity expressed as the percent of control corresponding to staurosporine stimulation of wild type PrP+/+ neurons transiently transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector (means of three independent transfections with 3F4MoPrPc cDNA)..

Primary cultured neurons devoid of their endogenous PrPc content display decreased p53 immunoreactivity (Fig. 8A) and transcriptional activity (Fig. 8B), thereby demonstrating that endogenous PrPc controls p53 expression and activity. Of greatest interest was the observation that p53 expression in the 1-month-old mouse brain was drastically lower in PrP-/- than in wild-type mice (Fig. 8C), indicating that PrPc also controls p53 expression in vivo..

Mdm2 was recently shown to decrease p53 metabolic stability thereby lowering its activity (20). We demonstrate here that Mdm2 immunoreactivity is higher in PrP-/- than in wild-type neurons (Fig. 8D), a phenotype completely opposite from that observed for p53 immunoreactivity (see Fig. 5A). As p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was reported to up-regulate p53 activity via upstream of Mdm2 expression (26), we also examined the endogenous levels of the active, phosphorylated counterpart of p38 MAPK. Active p38 immunoreactivity was higher in wild-type than in PrP-/- neurons (Fig. 8E), suggesting that PrPc also controls p38 phosphorylation at endogenous levels..

These pathologies became of higher interest when it appeared that some of these diseases could also affect human beings, leading to the logical suspicion that the human pathology could be transmitted by animals and, therefore, that mankind was facing a novel public health problem with unforeseeable consequences. The boost of interest in this novel and intriguing type of pathology has been focused mainly on a better knowledge of a 33-35 kDa sialoglycosylated and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored polypeptide called prion, which appears to be the main actor in the disease. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the pathogenic agent (or at least clearly its main component) was a protein called scrapie, or PrPres, which has the same primary sequence as its ubiquitous counterpart, cellular prion or PrPc (1). However, PrPres displays a -sheet-enriched structure that renders it highly resistant to proteolysis and prone to aggregation (1). How PrPres acquires its pathological conformation is not yet established but infectious inoculates "mimicking" the disease require endogenous PrPc to propagate, as they are fully innocuous in mice engineered to abrogate their endogenous PrPc protein content (6). Also yet not fully understood are the molecular determinants that initiate the pathogenic process in sporadic encephalopathies. A better understanding of these sporadic cases would likely come from a better knowledge of the physiological function of PrPc and the putative dysfunction that takes place when these diseases occur..

PrP mutations could trigger caspase activation (31), and murine scrapie appears to be associated with cell death (32). Furthermore, prion infection impairs the cellular response to oxidative stress inducers (33) and triggers apoptosis in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line (34). Altogether, these data suggest the ability of PrPc to modulate cell death, but whether this is due to an exacerbation of a proapoptotic function or, alternatively, to the alteration of an antiapoptotic phenotype could both be envisioned. The literature in this field does not really solve the debate, and there are opposing data supporting both possibilities. On one hand, Kuwahara et al. (8) have shown that serum deprivation-induced cell death is exacerbated in hippocampal neurons prepared from Prnp-/- mice. On the other hand, PrPc also appears to protect human neurons from cell death triggered by overexpression of the proapoptotic oncogene Bax (9). Finally, a recent paper indicates that PrPc could be a cellular mediator protecting retinal tissue from anisomycin-induced apoptosis (10). From the above data one should expect a drastic deleterious effect of PrPc deletion due to the abrogation of this antiapoptotic phenotype. This seems not to be the case, as PrPc-deficient mice are safe, healthy, and apparently develop and behave normally (15). Furthermore, a recent article indicates that post-natal deletion of the PrPc alters the excitability of CA1 hippocampal neurons but does not induce neurodegeneration in adulthood (12)..

Furthermore, we showed that PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is mediated by an Mdm2-regulated p53-dependent pathway in TSM1 neurons (14). These data are fully in agreement with a previous work demonstrating that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type PrPc could exhibit severe neurodegeneration (11). However, it could be argued that the PrPc-related phenotype could be, in both cases, due to overexpression of the protein. In line with such an hypothesis, a recent study nicely established that in N2A murine neuroblastoma cells, neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration could be associated with cytosolic accumulation of PrPc (35). These data fully agreed with our demonstration that the manipulation of cytosolic PrPc concentration could indeed affect cell death. Thus, proteasomal inhibition leads to increased PrPc-like immunoreactivity accompanied by drastic potentiation of caspase activation in HEK293 cells (13). Conversely, depletion of cellular PrPc by immunosequestration at the membrane precludes the PrPc-induced proapoptotic phenotype (13)..

In this context, we examined the contribution of endogenous PrPc to apoptotic response by monitoring cell death in primary cultured neurons derived from mice embryos in which the Prnp gene had been abrogated (Zrch-1). Our data show that deletion of PrPc led to a phenotype fully opposite of PrP overexpression. Prnp-/- neurons are indeed less sensitive to staurosporine as monitored by TUNEL-positive cells, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activity and immunoreactivity. Furthermore, this phenotype appears linked to a drastic reduction of p53 activity and immunoreactivity. Finally, the p53 activator (p38 MAPK) and inhibitor (Mdm2) immunoreactivities are reduced. This indicates that PrPc likely controls p53, at least in part, at a post-transcriptional level, as we demonstrated in TSM1 neurons by an overexpression approach (13). Therefore, our current study further demonstrates that PrPc controls caspase activity through a p53-dependent and Mdm2-regulated process and that this proapoptotic phenotype is not caused artifactually by overexpression of the protein..

B. abortus transports Hsp60 via the VirB type IV system onto its surface. Upon encounter with a macrophage, Hsp60 binds to PrPC, which is embedded in lipid rafts on the macrophage surface. This is thought to modulate phagocytosis (swimming internalization), mediate macropinosome formation, inhibit lysosome fusion, and steer the macropinosome to the formation of the replicative phagosome. Other, hitherto unknown effector proteins traveling via the VirB system are also involved (see text; based on the findings by Watarai et al. [reference 1])..
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	13	  For playing these tricks, Brucella relies on a set of virulence factors, including a bacterial injection organelle termed VirB or type IV secretion system (4 to 8). When exposed to macrophages in vitro, virB-deficient bugs cannot modulate phagocytosis and are degraded in the lysosome. But what does the VirB system exactly do in this context? According to Watarai et al. (1), it may be needed for transporting the bacterial heat shock protein Hsp60 onto the surface of the bug. Unexpectedly, the chaperonin Hsp60, which normally hangs out in the cytoplasm and deals with unfolded proteins (9), turns out to reside on the surface of wild-type Brucella abortus but not virB mutants..

There, Hsp60 appears to snatch at an unlikely friend, the cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is encoded by the Prnp gene and resides preferentially in rafts. PrPC is apparently recruited to the macrophage's membrane protrusions, which engulf the bacteria, and subsequently to the early macropinosome. In Prnpo/o macrophages, B. abortus does not modulate phagocytosis nor phagosome maturation. This is strikingly similar to the behavior of Brucella virB mutants and suggests that the Hsp60 to PrPC interaction is instrumental for these actions..

Its only known constituent is PrPSc, a conformational isoform of PrPC, which is expressed at various levels in most mammalian cells. The only established function of PrPC in vivo is to enable transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Ablation of Prnp abrogates prion replication (15) and pathogenesis (16). However, the physiological function of PrPC has remained mysterious. Prnpo/o mice show no obvious developmental defect and live long, happy lives (17). Subtle changes in circadian rhythms (18) and alterations of hippocampal function (19 to 22) have been described in Prnpo/o mice. However, some of these phenotypes were not reproduced by others (23) and none were clarified in molecular terms..

For example, PrPC binds copper (24) and was suggested to be a cuproenzyme, but others hold this finding for a red herring (25). PrPC may have antiapoptotic properties (26 to 29), but others find that it sensitizes neurons to apoptosis (30). PrPC peptides might be neurotoxic (31), or maybe not (32). Prion toxicity might be due to retrotranslocation of PrPC from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm (33), but maybe retrotranslocation does not occur after all (34). Hence, no unified view of PrPC function in health and disease has emerged from these observations, apart from the fact that PrPC is dispensable for life and normal development..

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	23	And yet reverse genetics shows that PrPC must have some biological function and bind to one or more partners in a functionally meaningful way. Transgenic expression of amino proximally truncated PrPC mutants causes cerebellar degeneration and early death (35). This phenotype is only observed in Prnpo/o mice and is fully reverted by substoichiometric coexpression of full-length PrPC. It follows that truncated PrP interferes with a physiological function of PrPC and that its effector domain lies in its amino proximal half. A similar phenotype is elicited by overexpression of the Dpl protein (36), which resembles truncated PrPC and may therefore represent an endogenous PrPC antagonist (37)..

Protective variations in the human prion gene, which arose recently in evolution, have disseminated much more efficiently among human populations than nonprotective polymorphisms (38). This provides a compelling case for a role in evolutionary fitness, similarly to globin gene mutations that are protective against malaria. Selective pressure to maintain heterozygosity might have come from Kuru, a cannibalism-transmitted prion disease that was a prime cause of death in New Guinea tribes. One disturbing conclusion is that cannibalism was commonplace among our ancestors (38). Consequently prion diseases, now exceedingly rare, have probably ravaged human populations in the distant past. What is most mystifying, Prnp null alleles were not selected for, despite the presumptive evolutionary advantage of resistance to cannibalism-induced prion disease..

Several PrPC binding factors have been described, including the laminin receptor precursor protein (39), heparan sulfate (40), N-CAM (41), and bcl-2 (42), yet none of these interactions were linked to biological functions. Could PrPC serve as a general Hsp60 sensor? Hsp60 homologues are found in bacteria and all eukaryotic cells, and can induce inflammation and immune responses (43, 44). It will be exciting to test whether PrPC is involved in an Hsp60-dependent common "danger sensing" mechanism for detection of destructed body cells and pathogenic microbes (43, 44)..

Many of the following exciting ramifications deserve to be studied: (a) Hsp60 is the first B. abortus protein whose presence on the outer surface relies on the type IV secretion system, yet it does not seem to participate to the type IV secretion apparatus itself. How is Hsp60 recognized and transported by the VirB type IV system? And how is it retained on the bacterial surface? (b) What is the function of the Hsp60 to PrPC complex? Is it simply slowing down the initial steps of phagocytosis to allow sufficient time for injection via the VirB type IV system and the manipulation of the early macropinosome by other so far unidentified effector proteins? Or does it serve as an anchor for assembling a whole set of host cellular proteins on the macropinosome membrane? (c) The Hsp60 to PrPC interaction is clearly insufficient for proper macropinosome formation and maturation. Hence, the function of the type IV secretion system must go beyond surface exposure of Hsp60. Which effector proteins travel via this pathway and what is their function? (d) Bacteria often accomplish their deeds by disrupting specialized cellular functions. Does Brucella interfere with the function of PrPC? If so, what does it get out of it? Answers to these questions may come from analyzing interactions between Hsp60 and amino terminally truncated versions of PrPC..

0.12956092.12913070.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD; OMIM 248370) is a rare, genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities including hypoplasia of the mandible and clavicles, acro-osteolysis, cutaneous atrophy and lipodystrophy. A homozygous missense mutation, Arg527His, in the LMNA gene which encodes nuclear lamina proteins lamins A and C has been reported in patients with MAD and partial lipodystrophy. We studied four patients with MAD who had no mutations in the LMNA gene. We now show compound heterozygous mutations, Phe361fsX379 and Trp340Arg, in the zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE24) gene in one of the four patients who had severe MAD associated with progeroid appearance and generalized lipodystrophy. ZMPSTE24 is involved in post-translational proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin A in two steps to form mature lamin A. Deficiency of Zmpste24 in mice causes accumulation of prelamin A and phenotypic features similar to MAD. The yeast homolog, Ste24, has a parallel role in processing of prenylated mating pheromone a-factor. Since human ZMPSTE24 can also process a-factor when expressed in yeast, we assessed the functional significance of the two ZMPSTE24 mutations in the yeast to complement the mating defect of the haploid MATa yeast lacking STE24 and Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1; another prenylprotein-specific endoprotease) genes. The ZMPSTE24 mutant construct, Phe361fsX379, was inactive in complementing the yeast a-factor but the mutant, Trp340Arg, was partially active compared to the wild type ZMPSTE24 construct. We conclude that mutations in ZMPSTE24 may cause MAD by affecting prelamin A processing..

A homozygous missense mutation, Arg527His, in the LMNA gene which encodes nuclear lamina proteins lamins A and C has been reported in patients with MAD and partial lipodystrophy. We studied four patients with MAD who had no mutations in the LMNA gene. We now show compound heterozygous mutations, Phe361fsX379 and Trp340Arg, in the zinc metalloproteinase (ZMPSTE24) gene in one of the four patients who had severe MAD associated with progeroid appearance and generalized lipodystrophy. ZMPSTE24 is involved in post-translational proteolytic cleavage of carboxy terminal residues of farnesylated prelamin A in two steps to form mature lamin A. Deficiency of Zmpste24 in mice causes accumulation of prelamin A and phenotypic features similar to MAD. The yeast homolog, Ste24, has a parallel role in processing of prenylated mating pheromone a-factor. Since human ZMPSTE24 can also process a-factor when expressed in yeast, we assessed the functional significance of the two ZMPSTE24 mutations in the yeast to complement the mating defect of the haploid MATa yeast lacking STE24 and Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1; another prenylprotein-specific endoprotease) genes. The ZMPSTE24 mutant construct, Phe361fsX379, was inactive in complementing the yeast a-factor but the mutant, Trp340Arg, was partially active compared to the wild type ZMPSTE24 construct. We conclude that mutations in ZMPSTE24 may cause MAD by affecting prelamin A processing..
0.12956092.12913070.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare syndrome with variable clinical features including mandibular and clavicular hypoplasia, acro-osteolysis of terminal phalanges, delayed closure of cranial sutures, joint contractures, mottled pigmentation, cutaneous atrophy, lipodystrophy and features of metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia (1). Previously, we described two patterns of lipodystrophy in patients with MAD: (i) type A pattern characterized by fat loss restricted to the extremities and (ii) type B pattern with more generalized fat loss (1). A homozygous missense mutation, Arg527His, in the LMNA gene was reported in Italian pedigrees with MAD and type A lipodystrophy (2). LMNA encodes lamins A and C by alternative splicing, which are integral components of nuclear lamina along with type B lamins (B1 and B2) which are encoded by two separate genes (3 to 5). Whereas type B lamins are expressed in all somatic cells, lamins A and C are preferentially expressed in differentiated cells (6). Precursors of lamins A, B1 and B2 have CAAX motif at the carboxy terminal and undergo post-translational modification including prenylation (5). However, lamin C lacks the carboxy-terminal CAAX motif and thus escapes prenylation. We sequenced LMNA in affected individuals from six pedigrees and found the Arg527His mutation in only two pedigrees with type A lipodystrophy (7). The remaining four pedigrees, in which the affected individuals showed type B lipodystrophy, revealed no mutations in the LMNA gene, suggesting additional genetic loci for MAD (7)..

0.12956092.12913070.html.plaintext.txt	9	Recently, some of the phenotypic features of MAD (i.e. partial lipodystrophy and skeletal abnormalities including small mandible) were reported in mice with homozygous deletion of the gene encoding a zinc metalloproteinase, Zmpste24 (8,9). Since Zmpste24 is involved in post-translational processing of prelamin A, the abnormal phenotypic features of Zmpste24-/- mice were attributed to defective processing of prelamin A (8,9). The generation of mature lamin A from prelamin A involves farnesylation of cysteine in the conserved CAAX motif at the carboxy-terminal (10) by the enzyme farnesyl transferase (Fig. 1). The AAX tripeptide is then proteolytically removed by ZMPSTE24, followed by methylation of the prenylated cysteine by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyl transferase. Finally, a second proteolytic cleavage, by ZMPSTE24 or another protease, removes 15 amino acids from the carboxy-terminal (10) (Fig. 1). Given the role of ZMPSTE24 in prelamin A processing and the occurrence of a LMNA mutation in MAD subjects, we considered ZMPSTE24 as a candidate gene and sequenced this locus in the remaining four patients..

During the second step, the peptide bond between the cysteine and serine residues (indicated by an unfilled triangle) is proteolytically cleaved by ZMPSTE24, resulting in removal of SIM tripeptide. This reaction is followed by methylation of the farnesylated cysteine residue by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyl transferase (ICMT) using S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Finally, a second proteolytic cleavage occurs between the tyrosine and leucine residues (indicated by a filled triangle), which is either catalyzed by ZMPSTE24 or by another, as yet unidentified, endoprotease, and this cleavage removes 15 amino acids from the carboxy-terminal, resulting in formation of mature lamin A..

One of the mutations, 1018T > C in exon 8, results in substitution of Trp at codon 340 to Arg (Fig. 2B). The second mutation, 1085insT in exon 9, causes a frameshift and a premature termination codon resulting in a truncated protein, Phe361fsX379. The parents and two siblings of the proband were healthy and were each heterozygous for one of the mutations (Fig. 2A). These mutations were not detected in 100 unrelated subjects of European ancestry. The other three MAD patients had no ZMPSTE24 mutations. In these patients, we sequenced an additional gene encoding nuclear prelamin A recognition factor (NARF) which binds to prenylated prelamin A carboxy-terminal domain (11), but found no substantial alterations..

The protein has seven transmembrane domains similar to the predicted domains of yeast ste24 (12). The residue tryptophan 340, which is mutated to arginine, lies adjacent to the catalytic motif close to the membrane on the cytoplasmic side, but is not embedded in the membrane (Fig. 3B). However, the frameshift mutation affects the phenylalanine 361 residue, which lies within the sixth membrane spanning domain and leads to a truncated protein (Fig. 3C). Thus, the carboxyl terminal of the mutant protein lies on the luminal side of the membrane and is not available for the catalytic action of the protease..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Transcriptional regulation by transforming growth factor- signaling is mediated by the Smad family of transcription factors. It is generally accepted that Smads must interact with other transcription factors to bind to their targets. However, recently it has been shown that a complex of the Drosophila Smad proteins, Mad and Medea, binds with high affinity to silencer elements that repress brinker and bag of marbles in response to Dpp signaling. Here we report that these silencers are bound by a heterotrimer containing two Mad subunits and one Medea subunit. We found that the MH1 domains of all three subunits contributed directly to sequence-specific DNA contact, thus accounting for the exceptionally high stability of the Smad-silencer complex. The Medea MH1 domain binds to a canonical Smad box (GTCT), whereas the Mad MH1 domains bind to a GC-rich sequence resembling Mad binding sites previously identified in Dpp-responsive enhancer elements. The consensus for this sequence, GRCGNC, differs from that of the canonical Smad box, but we found that Mad binding nonetheless required the same -hairpin amino acids that mediate base-specific contact with GTCT. Binding was also affected by alanine substitutions in Mad and Med at a subset of basic residues within and flanking helix 2, indicating a contribution to binding of the GRCGNC and GTCT sites. The slight alteration of the Dpp silencers caused them to activate transcription in response to Dpp signaling, indicating that the potential for Smad complexes to recognize specific targets need not be limited to repression..

The conserved Smad amino-terminal MH1 domain contributes to target recognition by binding to variations of the short sequence, GTCT (4). Upon activation by signaling, Smads form complexes such that more than one MH1 domain is available to contact DNA (5, 6). With a major portion of target recognition provided by interacting cofactors, DNA contact by a single MH1 domain can be sufficient for regulation in response to signaling (7 to 10)..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	7	In contrast, Smad complexes bind to several Drosophila silencer elements without the assistance of a cofactor (11, 12). These silencers repress the brinker (brk), bag of marbles (bam), and gooseberry (gsb) genes in response to signaling by decapentaplegic (dpp). Repression of brk plays a central role in the dpp pathway (13, 14); in addition to direct activation by Smads, Dpp targets are regulated indirectly through repression by the Brk protein (15 to 18). Repression of brk occurs through a silencer that binds a complex of the Smad proteins Mothers Against Dpp (Mad) and Medea (Med) (11). Mad is homologous to the BMP2-specific Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 receptor-activated Smads (rSmads). Med is the homolog of Smad4, the coSmad that forms complexes with rSmads. Genetic and biochemical analyses confirmed that Mad and Medea are both required for repression of brk (11, 19, 20). Repression of brk also requires the large zinc finger protein Schnurri (Shn) (11, 19, 20). Although Shn contains three zinc finger clusters, alone it does not bind to the silencer, and repression requires only a carboxyl-terminal region containing three zinc fingers that confer interaction with the silencer-bound Mad-Med complex (11, 12). In the gonad Dpp signaling and Shn are also required for repression of bam (21, 22), a differentiation factor that must be kept off in germ line stem cells (23). A Dpp-responsive silencer is located in the bam 5'-untranslated region just 27 bp from the transcriptional start (24). Both silencers consist of paired Mad and Med binding sites (12, 25), and binding of the Mad-Med complex in turn allows binding of Shn..

One means of achieving this would be for a greater number of MH1 domains to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The number of MH1 domains contained within a Smad complex is determined by the way in which Smad MH2 domains oligomerize (26 to 29). The tendency of MH2 domains to crystallize as trimers and heterotrimers (30 to 34) suggests that heterotrimers are the principal heteromeric Smad complex in vivo (34). However, work from several groups has provided evidence that Smads also form other types of complexes, including heterodimers (35 to 37)..

The silencers consist of Smad binding sites separated by five base pairs (Fig. 1A). The silencer consensus sequence was derived from sequence alignment and from determining the effects of base substitutions (12, 25).3 The left side of the consensus, GRCGNC, resembles the Mad binding consensus, GCCGnCG (41), whereas the right side, GTCT, matches the Smad3/Smad4 consensus for binding of a single MH1 domain (4, 42). Gel shift experiments with purified Mad and Med fusion proteins showed that Mad binds with similar affinity to either site, whereas Med has high affinity only for the GTCT (Fig. 1B) (12, 25). This suggests a simple model in which Mad and Med bind to the left and right side of the silencer, respectively. Gel shift experiments with lysates of transfected cells show that Mad and Med bind the silencers as a complex, with antibody supershifts confirming the presence of both proteins in the complex (Fig. 1C) (11, 12). The binding of the Mad-Med complex allows Shn to be recruited via a carboxyl-terminal region (ShnCT, Fig. 1C) (11, 12). We noticed that when supershifting a complex in which Mad was epitope-tagged, a faint second supershifted band was sometimes visible (Fig. 1D), which is an indication that some complexes may contain two Mad subunits..

The resulting 1x and 2x GFP fusions to Mad and Med bound to BamSE and BrkS probes in gel shift assays with about the same affinity as their normal counterparts but with slower mobility that was easily distinguishable from the wild-type Mad-Med-silencer complex (Fig. 2A). This allowed us to test whether each Smad existed in one or two copies within the DNA-bound complex. For example, if only one Mad exists in the complex, coexpression of Mad and 2xGFPMad (together with Med and TkvQD) should give two bands, the normal Mad-Med complex and the slower mobility 2xGFPMad-Med complex. If the complex contains two Mad subunits, there should be three bands, Mad-Mad-Med, Mad-2xGFPMad-Med, and 2xGFPMad-2xGFPMad-Med. Using a BamSE probe, the combination of Mad, 2xGFPMad, and Med resulted in three bands (Fig. 2A), of which the intermediate band was the strongest in intensity, as expected because Mad-2xGFPMad-Med complexes should be twice as abundant as complexes containing only one Mad isoform. Furthermore, the intermediate band had the same mobility observed for a 1xGFP-Mad + Med complex, consistent with a mobility shift caused by the presence of two copies of eGFP. The same result was obtained using a BrkS probe (Fig. 2B), and thus we conclude the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains two Mad subunits. In contrast, we found that lysates containing Mad, Med and 2xGFPMed formed only two bands (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains only a single Med subunit..

This conservation of the DNA-binding interface suggests that all Smads might bind DNA with the same sequence specificity. However, the GC-rich binding sites first described for Mad and later for Smad1 appear to be distinct from the canonical Smad3 GTCT site, and it has been proposed that such sites are bound through sequence-nonspecific contact with the lysine-rich helix 2, which lies adjacent to the -hairpin (46, 47)..

To investigate the basis for this sequence specificity, we introduced alanine substitutions at three positions within the Mad -hairpin, Arg-88, Gln-90, and Lys-95, each of which corresponds to a Smad3 residue whose side chain makes direct base-specific contact in the Smad3-DNA structure (Fig. 3A) (42). Western blots showed that these mutations and all others described below had little or no effect on the level of Mad or Med in whole cell lysates (Fig. 3B, bottom). Nonetheless, all three mutations strongly reduced complex formation with BrkS (Fig. 3B) or BamSE (data not shown). As expected, alanine substitutions at the corresponding positions in Med had a similar effect (Fig. 3B). We also tested an alanine substitution for Mad His-93, which corresponds to His-79 in Smad3, a residue that makes indirect base contact through water molecules (47), and found that it caused a less drastic but reproducible reduction in binding affinity for BrkS (Fig. 3B).

The lysine-rich stretch of helix 2 has been shown to function as a nuclear localization signal (48, 49) but a series of helix 2 lysine to alanine mutations resulted in little or no change in Mad or Med levels in whole cell lysates of transfected 293T cells, as determined from Western blots (Fig. 3B). Comparing these lysates in gel shift experiments, we found that Mad-Med-BrkS complex formation was strongly disrupted by Mad R58A, a residue that is just carboxyl-terminal to helix 2, with moderate effects caused with Mad K46A and by Med R66A, K74A and D80A (Fig. 3B). The results show that helix 2 and carboxyl-terminally adjacent residues contribute to the DNA binding activity of Med as well as that of Mad, suggesting that helix 2-backbone contact may be a general feature of Smad-DNA interaction and not exclusive to interaction with the GRCGNC site. Together, these results suggest that Mad and Med both contact DNA via the -hairpin in a configuration that is similar to that of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to GTCT, possibly with helix 2 tilted somewhat closer to the DNA backbone. Notably, alanine substitutions in helix 2 of Mad and Med had no obvious effect on recruitment of ShnCT (Fig. 3C). Because binding of ShnCT requires precise 5-bp spacing between GRCGNC and GTCT (discussed below), the MH1 domains are likely sites for Shn interaction. These results indicate that any MH1 contact with ShnCT does not depend critically on solvent-exposed helix 2 side chains..

Indeed, the R58A substitution had little effect on binding of purified maltose-binding protein-MadNL (which binds as a monomer) to probes containing GTCT or GGCGAC, whereas R88A dramatically reduced binding to both probes (data not shown), evidence that Arg-58 is not directly involved in DNA contact. Rather than directly contacting DNA, Arg-58 may engage in protein-protein interactions that stabilize the DNA-bound Mad-Med heterotrimer.

Shn binding and repression require correct spacing and orientation of binding sites within the Dpp-responsive silencers. A, selected mutations in BrkS that demonstrate the importance of binding site sequence and topology for repression. Changed bases in Mut1 and Mut2 are in bold lowercase type. B, gel shift assays showing the effects of topological changes in the BrkS silencer. Compared with wild-type, reversal of the GTCT (Mut1) disrupted binding of the Mad-Med complex. In contrast, changing GTCT to GGCG (Mut2) reduced the Mad-Med complex only slightly but binding of ShnCT was undetectable. Reducing the distance between the Mad and Med binding sites by 1 bp (Mut3) had little effect on binding of the Mad-Med complex but binding of ShnCT was undetectable. DNA binding reactions contained BrkS probe and lysate from 293T cells transfected with effector plasmids for expression of Flag-Mad, HA-Med, or ShnCT, as indicated (all transfected with TkvQD). C, reporter assays in Drosophila S2 cells showing that Smad binding site sequence, orientation and spacing are critical for repression. Repression in response to TkvQD was disrupted by reversal of the Med binding site (Mut1), whereas Mut2 and Mut3 show that changing GTCT to GGCG or reducing the spacing between Mad and Med sites resulted in TkvQD-induced activation. As diagrammed above the graph, the reporter plasmids contained BrkS positioned upstream of a 3xSu(H) binding site array, which allowed for activation in response to cotransfected effector plasmids for Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and an activated version of Notch (Nact) (11, 12, 40).

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	44	  A Mad-Med Heterotrimer Can Activate Transcription The significance of the GRCGNC(N)5GTCT topology was investigated with a series of rearrangements (Fig. 5A). Reversal of the GTCT in BrkS (mut1 in Fig. 5A) reduced binding of the Mad-Med-silencer complex formation (Fig. 5B) and essentially eliminated repression (Fig. 5C). In contrast, changing GTCT to GGCG (mut2 in Fig. 5A) had only a modest effect on Mad-Med binding but prevented recruitment of Shn (Fig. 5B), transforming the silencer into a Dpp-responsive activating element (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a 1-bp increase (data not shown) or decrease (mut3 in Fig. 5A) in spacing converted the silencer into an activating element (Fig. 5C), again disrupting Shn binding without severely affecting the binding of Mad and Med (Fig. 5B). In the latter two cases, Mad and Med still bound to the DNA as a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ratio (Fig. 5D). Similar results were obtained with the same alterations of BamSE. These results demonstrate that repression is dependent on a precise (GRCGNC)-(N)5-GTCT arrangement and that trimeric Smad complexes that cannot recruit Shn behave as transcriptional activators..
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	45	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In this report we provide evidence that Mad and Med bind to Dpp-responsive silencers as a 2:1 heterotrimer and that all three subunits of this complex make sequence-specific DNA contact by means of the MH1 domain -hairpin (Fig. 6). Slight alterations in sequence transform these silencers into Dpp-responsive activating elements that continue to be bound by a 2:1 Mad-Med heterotrimer but with a conformation that does not allow recruitment of Shn. This work also demonstrates that Mad binds to GC-rich sites, originally defined as GCCGNCG (41) and more recently in the context of silencers as GRCGNC (12), by sequence-specific contact with two subunits. Sequence-specific interaction with GC-rich sites has been demonstrated previously for Smad1 (50) and for Mad (12), but the stoichiometry of these interactions was not documented. Finding that the 6-bp site is contacted by two Mad subunits raises new questions, because it is not clear how the two MH1 domains are arranged on the DNA, nor is it known why GNCG or GNCN (depending on orientation) is recognized rather than the GTCT site preferred by Smad3 and Smad4. Previous work involving Smad1-Smad3 chimeras identified Lys-36 and Ser-37 of Smad3 helix 2 versus Asp-35 and Ala-36 in Smad1 as a key difference necessary for the activation of a (CAGA)9-luc reporter (51). However, we found that mutation of the corresponding residue in Mad (D49A) had little or no effect on binding to BrkS, and thus the structural determinants for the GRCGNC binding site preference of Mad (and by inference, Smad1) remain to be identified..
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	46	Our findings contradict a previous report that Mad and Med bind to BrkS as a dimer (12). Although no documentation was provided for how this was determined experimentally, our own attempts to determine stoichiometry by means of antibody supershift experiments suggest a possible explanation for the discrepancy. We found that epitope tags at the Mad amino terminus are only readily accessible to the antibody on one of the two Mad subunits (Fig. 1D), possibly because of crowding by the adjacent DNA-bound MH1 domain of Med. This problem led us to turn instead to the use of protein fusions as a strategy (43) for assessing stoichiometry..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	48	Mad and Med appear to be the only factors that directly contact the bam and brk silencers (11, 12). This conclusion is based on mutational analysis of the BrkS element, which showed that mutations that disrupt silencing also disrupt binding of the Mad-Med complex. The only exceptions were mutation of GTCT to GTCG (12) or to GGCG (Fig. 5) and a 1-bp deletion between the Mad and Med sites (12) (Fig. 5), each of which allowed binding of the Mad-Med complex but disrupted recruitment of Shn. Overexpression of activated Mad-Med complexes is sufficient to generate these gel shift complexes, and therefore it is unlikely that an unknown cofactor is required because it would presumably need to be expressed at high levels endogenously in both Drosophila and human cells. The demonstration that binding of the Mad-Med heterotrimer requires all three MH1 domains also weighs against cofactor involvement because it becomes difficult to explain how GRCGNC could be contacted by a cofactor in addition to two Mad MH1 domains (the Med MH1 contacting GTCT). Nonetheless, it is possible that a cofactor present in Drosophila and human extracts has gone undetected, although the evidence suggests it could not play a direct role in sequence-specific DNA contact..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	50	The apparent ability of a Mad-Med complex to bind silencers without cofactors contrasts with the general reliance of Smads on DNA-binding cofactors for target specificity. brk could be considered a special case because it is negatively regulated by Dpp globally (15 to 18), whereas other Dpp targets require tissue-specific regulation (41, 52 to 57). However, bam expression is specific to germ line cells, and thus it is unexpected that DNA contact by Mad and Med would be sufficient for the regulatory specificity of the bam silencer. The existence of a similar Dpp-responsive silencer regulating gooseberry (12) provides further evidence that these novel arrangements of Smad binding sites provide sufficient specificity for regulation in response to signaling. Nonetheless, tissue specificity might be augmented by cooperative interaction of DNA-bound corepressors with Smads bound to BrkS/BamSE-like sites..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	52	The high affinity of Mad and Med for these silencers is explained by the trimeric stoichiometry and involvement of all MH1 domains in directly contacting DNA. The ability of a single Smad complex to engage all three MH1 domains in DNA contact has several implications. The most obvious is that Smad complexes may in some cases make a greater contribution to target recognition than was previously apparent. As in the case of brk, this provides a mechanism by which Dpp, BMP, or even transforming growth factor- signaling might trigger a general response without the need for a tissue-specific cofactor. Such a response need not be limited to silencing because slight alterations in the silencers transform them into Dpp-responsive activating elements, possibly by allowing CBP to interact with the Mad-Med complex (58) in the absence of Shn. Conserved sites exhibiting the BrkS/BamSE motif have been identified within BMP-response elements for the Id genes (59 to 61), which as a class are responsive to BMP signaling (62, 63). Conversely, tissue specificity might be conferred upon such tripartite Smad response elements by adjacent binding sites for other transcription factors..

The observed flexibility in spacing between the Mad and Med sites in BrkS and BamSE suggests that DNA binding by Med plus just one Mad MH1 domain might be able to occur in a variety of permutations. However, loss of binding when the Med site was reversed (mut1 in Fig. 5B) shows that the topology of Smad sites has strict limits. A moderate affinity site might also consist of just the GRCGNC Mad binding site without an adjacent Med binding site, as appears to be the case for many Dpp-responsive enhancer elements (41, 52 to 54, 57, 64, 65).3 Such moderate affinity sites would activate transcription in response to Dpp signaling, but only when the necessary tissue-specific cofactor is present. Some Mad sites serve also as binding sites for the Brk protein, which opposes Dpp signaling by direct competition for Mad binding and by functioning as an active repressor (40, 66 to 69)..

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	56	The third implication is for complexity in the response to BMP signaling. In vertebrates that possess three BMP-responsive rSmads, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, BMP signaling might trigger the formation of a variety of trimeric rSmad complexes with Smad4 (e.g. a Smad1-Smad5-Smad4 complex). There is the potential for six such combinations (114, 554, 884, 154, 184, and 584). If such mixed complexes do form, as has been shown for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in activation of p15Ink4B (70), it will be important to determine whether differences exist among them in the range of binding sites that can be bound by means of two or three MH1 domains. The likelihood of differential cofactor interactions by Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 adds an additional layer of complexity..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	2	The preface provided by George Bernard Shaw to The Doctor s Dilemma1 is a profoundly insightful and deliberately provocative essay on the short-comings of health care, as provided by doctors who are deficient in scientific thought and are driven by petty profit motives. It is also an eloquent espousal of an ideal public health system, devoid of those flaws. Though Shaw was unduly harsh on Pasteur, improperly critical of the efforts to eliminate smallpox and his prototype of an underpaid doctor driven to malpractice no longer exists in many parts of the world, most of the ideas developed in the preface are of great contemporary relevance..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	4	Shaw s consistent demand for credible evidence is the hallmark of a truly scientific mind. He expresses despair, and even disgust, at the usual medical practitioner not applying the methods of scientific enquiry and the principles of statistical analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment methods which they espouse with ill-informed enthusiasm and willingly inflict on an unsuspecting public. The situation has not improved greatly since Shaw s time. Even as  evidence  constantly accumulates in the pages of prolific research publications, the average practitioner is often distanced from its message. Even when a part of that message does reach him or her, often through the pharmaceutical industry s sales promoters or through the lay media, the aptitude and the ability to subject that message to serious scientific scrutiny are severely deficient..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	6	Shaw protests against the incorrect use of statistics and the lack of matched comparison groups. He argues convincingly that apparent benefits of interventions are easily demonstrable in the absence of a matched comparison group and cautions that such spurious interpretations ought not to guide medical practice. He makes out a good case for employing the scientific design of a controlled trial for evaluating medical interventions. He is particularly caustic about the ecological fallacies that arise from analyses that depend on time trends and do not take into account the confounding effects of concomitant changes in other determinants. The example he provides, of the relationship between disappearance of typhus and amputation of the little finger, is particularly telling. The clarity with which he identifies and describes confounding as a factor which bedevils  causal  associations would do an epidemiologist proud..

His socialist ideology and scientific temper blend into a brilliantly incisive analytical tool as he dissects out the contributions of poverty and deprivation to ill health and pours out his convictions in a passionate piece of advocacy urging greater attention to such broader determinants of health. The adverse health implications of a low socioeconomic status have now been widely documented in virtually all areas of health, from under-nutrition and infectious diseases to many of the non-communicable diseases. While a Virchow, a McKeown, or a Marmot may call attention to this from among the public health fraternity, it requires the writing power of a Dickens or a Shaw to stir the conscience of the world to take heed and initiate action..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	10	The issues related to  confidence intervals  and  absolute risk  also come up in Shaw s preface, although the specific terms are not used. He questions the validity of drawing conclusions from estimates based on a zero numerator and a denominator which is very small (he uses a sample size of one in the smallpox vaccination example). The need to estimate confidence intervals and use them for judging the possible range of the effect size associated with an intervention has been emphasized often enough in statistics. Yet a substantial section of published research, and clinical practice even more so, have not yet benefited from the statistical lesson that Shaw provides us. Too often the  zero numerator  exercises a seductive appeal that clouds judgement, as the upper confidence limit is blissfully ignored by those who interpret the numbers.2 Similarly, published studies too often focus on relative risk to put a  spin  on the results of trials, without informing the practising doctor as to the difference that is likely to occur in the absolute risk of an event. Thus a measure of risk which is relevant to the study of aetiological associations is substituted, in a pseudoscientific sleight of hand, for a measure of risk which is relevant to decision making on individual management in clinical practice. The  cruder tricks  which disturbed Shaw continue to dismay us when results of scientific investigations are inaccurately interpreted, either out of ignorance or with deliberate intent to mislead..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	12	Shaw is particularly lucid when he talks of the benefits of  attention  to health, which need to be accounted for, before ascribing the virtue of independent benefit to an intervention. The beneficial effects of placebos and of the attention bestowed on the participants in a clinical trial have been well described in many recent publications on clinical research methodology. That Shaw demanded rigorous proof of a truly independent contribution made by an intervention is remarkable, when we consider that even now policy and practice are all too frequently swayed by the results of uncontrolled or inadequately controlled studies (such as some demonstration projects) wherein the effects of co-intervention and confounding are poorly assessed..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	14	Shaw discusses the influence of demand and supply on the nature of medical practice from two seemingly contradictory but essentially complementary viewpoints. On the one hand, he laments (and rightly so) that giving the doctor a pecuniary interest in prescribing costly tests, medication, or surgery motivates him to manipulate the  demand  to suit his interests. That such a  supplier driven demand  makes medical care a prime example of market failure is all too evident in the present era of technology-intensive high cost investigations and interventions. At the same time, he also argues that the laity can reset the nature of the supply, by demanding certain types of care or expressing a preference for hygienic modes of disease prevention. This too is true, as the growing market for  complementary  or  alternative  systems of medicine demonstrates. It is not surprising that practitioners of  modern  medicine are also now warming up to some of these treatment methods, after many years of scepticism. The fact that there is now a great scientific and public health interest in the health promoting effects of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as in the merits of a Mediterranean diet supports the contention that doctors recognize the need to respect conventional wisdom and respond to it with research which can confirm or repudiate..

They would employ reductionist research to seek out the protective phytochemicals, antioxidants or fibre from fruits and vegetables, so that they can be marketed as pills and potions. The imbalance between a supplier-driven demand and a consumer-generated demand would always be resolved in favour of the provider, till consumers (acting as communities and as individuals) become better informed and more assertive in resetting the demand for the health care they deserve and desire..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	18	Shaw finally suggests a model, wherein pubic health which is protected and promoted by a Public Health Service comprising Medical Officers of Health who are committed to act as benefactors of the community, to replace the petty private tradesmen profiteering from illness. This is a model that has only been partly developed and insufficiently applied, even in countries with socialized systems of health care, and hence cannot be considered as one adequately tried and tested. It is tragic, therefore, that the model is being discarded as a failure and that national health services are being dismantled in a hurry to provide a free rein to privatized and commercialized medical care. Shaw s vision is even more relevant today than at the time of his writing. This is because the commodification of health care has proceeded to far more sinister levels of organization than in the days of the  precarious, shabby-genteel, irresponsible  private practitioner whom he perceived as the principal danger. The Jekyll to Hyde pathway of transformation has proceeded through stages, from the benign family physician to the greedy private doctor to the medical cartels in larger hospitals to the present state where large corporations control the production and distribution of drugs, devices and other technologies for which the individual doctor is only a robotic sales agent. As the juggernaut of commercial medicine rolls on, the individual doctor s role too becomes inconsequential and the citizen s health is further forfeit to corporate profits..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	20	It is tempting to speculate on how Shaw would have reacted to the social forces which are shaping global health today as well as to the new threats to public health that have emerged since his time. The epidemics of non-communicable diseases now sweeping across the world are being driven by some of the undesirable elements of industrialization, urbanization and globalization. From tobacco to processed food and from drugs to vaccines, the language of trade threatens to dominate the discourse on public health. The agents of ill health are marketed aggressively by transnational mega-corporations as they battle to win over the minds and the money of consumers spread over many countries. Even communicable diseases come in new forms as globalized trade not only speeds up human travel but also promotes livestock farming at an industrial level. One wonders what caustic comments would have come from Shaw s critical pen about the factors that led to  mad cow disease  or even sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which may be a byproduct of an expanding animal to human interface in a setting of unhygienic livestock breeding for commercial purposes..

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	22	The solutions needed today, therefore, go beyond the creation of a responsive and responsible Medical Officer of Health. We require a broader and stronger edifice of global public health in which the multiple determinants of health are addressed and influenced from a perspective where peoples  health takes precedence over corporate wealth. The mould which makes the individual doctor too needs to be recast. Epidemiology, economics, and ethics which are sadly deficient in modern medical training need to be strengthened, so that the doctor who emerges from the portals of the medical college is endowed with a scientific temper, a spirit of social responsibility, and the ability to utilize available resources more efficiently for promoting better health outcomes. The role of non-physician health care providers has increased since Shaw s time and needs to be further strengthened. Well informed involvement of communities in health promotion and of patients in self care are receiving greater emphasis in the participatory models of health care that seek to replace the prescriptive models. All of these components must contribute to a more scientific, efficient, and equitable pattern of health care. Towards the end of this preface, Shaw expresses optimism that public health will get the champions it needs to provide a social solution to the medical problem. I too will end this commentary with the hope that global consciousness will rise to ensure the triumph of public health over the many threats it faces..

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	2	Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders which affect a range of mammalian species. In humans they can be inherited and sporadic as well as acquired by exposure to human prions. Prions appear to be composed principally of a conformational isomer of host-encoded prion protein and propagate by recruitment of cellular prion protein. Recent evidence argues that prion protein can also encode disease phenotypes by differences in its conformation and glycosylation. Such molecular analysis of prion strains suggests that new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by BSE exposure. The novel biology of prion propagation may not be unique to these rare degenerative brain diseases. INTRODUCTION.

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	4	The human prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have been traditionally classified into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) and kuru.

Transmission of GSS followed in 1981 (3 ). The prototypic prion disease, scrapie, is a naturally occurring disease of sheep and goats, and has been recognised for >200 years (4 ). Scrapie was demonstrated to be transmissible by inoculation in 1936 (5 ) and it was the recognition that histopathologically kuru, and then CJD, resembled scrapie that led to suggestions that these diseases may also be transmitted by inoculation (6 ,7 ). Kuru is a neurodegenerative condition characterised principally by a progressive cerebellar ataxia which reached epidemic proportions amongst the Fore linguistic group in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea and which was transmitted by cannibalism. Since the cessation of cannibalism in the 1950s the disease has declined but a few cases still occur as a result of the long incubation periods in this condition (8 ). Transmission of CJD from case to case has occurred by a number of routes involving accidental inoculation with human prions as a result of medical procedures. Such iatrogenic routes include the use of inadequately sterilised neurosurgical instruments, dura mater and corneal grafting, and use of human cadaveric pituitary derived growth hormone or gonadotrophin..

Inherited cases constitute ~15% of cases, acquired cases (kuru and iatrogenic CJD) are rare. Most human cases are sporadic, and their precise aetiology is still unclear. Both human and animal prion diseases share common histopathological features. The classical triad of spongiform vacuolation (affecting any part of the cerebral grey matter), astrocytic proliferation and neuronal loss, may be accompanied by the deposition of amyloid plaques (9 ). These plaques are composed principally of an abnormal, partially protease resistant isoform of a host encoded sialoglycoprotein, prion protein (PrP). PrP is expressed widely but at much higher levels in neuronal cells as a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored cell surface protein (10 )..

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	11	The transmissible agent, or prion, seems to consist principally of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP), designated PrPSc (11 ). PrPSc is known to be derived from the cellular isoform, PrPC, by a post-translational mechanism (12 ,13 ) and evidence is mounting that this change is conformational rather than covalent (14 ,15 ).While PrPC is fully sensitive to proteolysis, PrPSc, which accumulates in the brain during disease, is partially protease resistant. The human PrP gene (PRNP) is a single copy gene located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (16 ); it spans 16 kb and contains two exons (17 ,18 ). The complete open reading frame of 759 nucleotides is contained within the larger second exon which comprises the majority of the 2.4 kb mRNA. A key advance in the understanding of prion biology was the identification of mutations in PRNP in the familial forms of the human diseases. The first mutation to be identified in PRNP was in a family with CJD and constituted a 144 bp insertion into the coding sequence (19 ). A second mutation was reported in two families with GSS and genetic linkage was confirmed between this missense variant at codon 102 and GSS, confirming that GSS was an autosomal dominant Mendelian disorder (20 ). This genetic variant was not present in the normal population but was rapidly identified in numerous other unrelated GSS kindreds. These diseases are therefore both inherited in the germline and transmissible by inoculation, and are biologically unique in this regard..

Pathogenic mutations reported to date in the human PrP gene consist of two groups: (i) point mutations within coding sequence resulting in amino acid substitutions in PrP or in one case production of a stop codon resulting in expression of a truncated PrP; (ii) insertions encoding additional integral copies of an octapeptide repeat present in a tandem array of five copies in the normal protein (Fig. 1 ). The availability of direct gene markers for these diseases has enabled identification of highly atypical cases and has widened the known phenotypic range of these disorders (23 ,24 ). Remarkable phenotypic variability may be present in the same family, with phenotypes ranging from classical CJD to atypical dementias with extremely long duration and lacking the typical histological features of spongiform encephalopathy (25 ).

In Caucasians, ~38% are homozygous for the more frequent methionine allele, 51% are heterozygotes and 11% are homozygous for valine (27 ). The large majority of sporadic CJD occurs in individuals homozygous for this polymorphism (28 ) and most pituitary hormone related iatrogenic CJD cases are homozygotes, with a particular excess of valine homozygotes (29 ). This protective effect of PRNP heterozygosity is also seen in some inherited prion diseases where the age at onset of disease is 1-2 decades later in heterozygotes at PRNP codon 129 as compared with homozygotes (30 ,31 )..

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although prion diseases can be transmitted between mammalian species by inoculation, in practice it is difficult to do so, and typically transmission occurs in only a small proportion of inoculated animals and then only after prolonged incubation periods on primary passage. On second and subsequent passage of infectivity into animals of the same species, incubation periods are typically much shortened, relatively synchronous as compared with primary passage, and all inoculated animals succumb to disease. A key component of this so-called `species barrier' is the degree of homology between the PrP in the donor and recipient species. Mice transgenic for hamster PrP lose their species barrier to hamster prions (32 ). When such transgenic mice were challenged with mouse derived prions, the infectivity they produced was fully pathogenic for mice but not hamsters, while on challenge with hamster derived prions they produced prions fully pathogenic to hamsters but not mice. The interpretation of this finding is that a direct interaction between PrP molecules occurs at some stage in the process of prion propagation and that such interaction occurs most easily if the interacting PrP molecules are identical. Such work led to the idea that replication of prions may occur by PrPSc interacting directly with PrPC and catalysing the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (32 ,33 ). Such an effect could then lead to a chain reaction of conversion leading to the progressive conversion of increasing amounts of PrPC to PrPSc. The pathogenic mutations in the prion protein may result in the production of a protein that converts spontaneously to PrPSc in individuals with inherited prion diseases. Such a model provides an explanation of how a disease can be simultaneously inherited and transmissible. The finding that nearly all sporadic CJD occurs in homozygotes with respect to a common and apparently innocent protein polymorphism lends strong support to such a mechanism (28 ). Again prion protein interaction would occur most favourably in individuals with two identical copies of the prion protein. Heterozygotes, producing two different proteins, would be somewhat protected, as if by an internal `species barrier'. It is possible that the occasional individuals heterozygous at codon 129 who do develop sporadic CJD have a more prolonged illness although more detailed studies are required to investigate this further (34 ). PrP valine 129 and PrP methionine 129 would be expected to differ slightly in their propensity to conversion to PrPSc. The excess of PrP valine 129 homozygotes amongst human pituitary hormone related cases suggests that PrP valine 129 may be the more susceptible (29 )..

It has been speculated that these cases might arise from somatic mutation of PRNP or spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc as a rare stochastic event. The alternative hypothesis, that such cases arise as a result of exposure to an environmental source of either human or animal prions, is not supported by epidemiological evidence (35 ). Since transgenic mice expressing extremely high levels of wild-type hamster or murine PrP develop a spontaneous neuromuscular disease (36 ), that appears to be transmissible, it has also been suggested that some cases of sporadic CJD may arise as a result of PrP overexpression..

Mice homozygous for PrP null alleles appear to develop and behave normally (39 ). Such mice are completely resistant to developing prion disease following inoculation and do not propagate infectivity (40 ,41 ). However, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated impaired GABAA mediated synaptic inhibition in hippocampal brain slices maintained in vitro and also reduced long-term potentiation (42 ), an abnormality independently confirmed in a different PrP knockout line (43 ). However, others have failed to replicate this finding, albeit using different techniques and experimental conditions (44 ). That this phenotype is rescued by expression of human PrP in such mice confirmed its specificity for PrP (45 ). These abnormalities of synaptic inhibition are reminiscent of the neurophysiological abnormalities seen in patients with CJD and in scrapie infected mice (46 ), raising the possibility that prion neurodegeneration may be, at least in part, due to loss of PrP function rather than to a deleterious effect of PrPSc (42 ). The relative normality of PrP null mice, which do not develop progressive neurodegeneration, could result from effective adaptive changes during neurodevelopment. It is possible that the sequestration of PrPC into PrPSc during prion disease in a developed nervous system lacking such plasticity has more severe consequences. Certainly, PrPSc does not appear to be toxic to cells lacking PrPC (47 ) and PrPSc is difficult to detect in some cases of the inherited human prion disease fatal familial insomnia (FFI) (48 ), and in transgenic mice infected experimentally with FFI (49 ), suggesting that, at least in these cases, neurodegeneration may not be the result of PrPSc toxicity. According to such a model, the gain of function implied by the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance could reflect the formation of PrPSc which then functionally depletes PrPC by a dominant negative effect..

Only four cases of sporadic CJD had previously been recorded in the literature in teenagers, and none of these cases occurred in the UK. In addition, both cases were unusual in having kuru-type plaques, a finding seen in only ~5% of CJD cases. Soon afterwards a third very young sporadic CJD case occurred (56 ). These cases caused considerable concern and the possibility was raised that they might suggest a link with BSE. By March 1996, further extremely young onset cases were apparent and review of the histology of these cases showed a remarkably consistent and unique pattern (57 ). These cases were named `new variant' CJD although it was clear that they were also rather atypical in their clinical presentation; in fact most cases did not meet the accepted clinical diagnostic criteria for probable CJD (57 ) and, in some respects at least, clinically more closely resembled kuru (58 ). Extensive studies of archival cases of CJD or other prion diseases failed to show this picture and it seemed that this did represent the arrival of a new form of prion disease in the UK. The statistical probability of such cases occurring by chance was vanishingly small and ascertainment bias seemed most unlikely as an explanation. It was clear that a new risk factor for CJD had emerged and appeared to be specific to the UK. The UK Government advisory committee on spongiform encephalopathy (SEAC) concluded that, while there was no direct evidence for a link with BSE, exposure to specified bovine offal (SBO) prior to the ban on its inclusion in human foodstuffs in 1989, was the most likely explanation. A case of the new variant was reported in France soon after (59 ). PRNP analysis showed that all cases available for study were homozygous, for methionine at codon 129, and that no known or novel pathogenic mutations were found in PRNP coding sequence (60 ). Recently, transmission of BSE to three macaques has been reported, with production of histopathological appearances that are closely similar to the very unusual pattern of pathology seen in new variant CJD (61 ), providing further evidence that these cases may result from BSE transmission.

The identification of a biochemical marker that distinguished new variant CJD from previously recognised forms of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD confirmed that this was a novel variant and implied that it was caused by exposure to a single novel prion strain type (62 ). The lack of any history of iatrogenic exposure to humans in these patients suggested that this was a novel animal prion. The molecular strain characteristics of new variant CJD closely resembled those seen in BSE itself and BSE transmitted to mice, domestic cat and macaque, consistent with BSE being the origin of new variant CJD (62 ). Such PrPSc markers are detectable in tonsil (63 ), which may allow pre-mortem diagnosis of new variant CJD without brain biopsy, and may potentially allow earlier diagnosis. Transmission studies.

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	37	Experimental transmission studies of the human prion diseases have, until recently, largely involved transmission to laboratory primates, in particular chimpanzees and squirrel monkeys. The extensive experience of the NIH group, reporting >300 successful transmissions has recently been summarised (64 ). However, transmission studies in primates are severely limited by the expense of such studies and by ethical concerns as to the use of primates in such work. Attempts by most laboratories to transmit human prions to rodents have been fairly unsuccessful, with only occasional transmissions occurring and then at very prolonged incubation periods close to the natural lifespan of the mice. Some groups have, however, reported more frequent transmissions (65 ). Recently transgenic mice have become available which have increased susceptibility to human prions. Mice expressing a chimaeric human/mouse PrP were susceptible to three CJD isolates with short incubation periods (66 ). It has now become clear that transgenic mice expressing wild-type human PrP, but not mouse PrP, are highly susceptible to CJD, with all inoculated mice succumbing at short incubation periods usually in the range of 180-220 days (67 ,68 ). Such mice appear to lack a species barrier to human prions and can now be used for extensive studies of the transmission characteristics of human prion diseases and to bioassay human prions (68 ).

Such strains are distinguished by their biological properties: they produce distinct incubation periods and patterns of neuropathological targeting in inbred mouse lines. As they can be serially propagated in inbred mice with the same Prn-p genotype they cannot be encoded by differences in PrP primary structure. Furthermore, strains can be re-isolated in mice after passage in intermediate species with different PrP primary structures (69 ). Understanding how a protein-only infectious agent could encode such phenotypic information has been of considerable biological interest..

These strains can be distinguished by differing physiochemical properties of the accumulated PrPSc in the brains of affected hamsters (71 ). Following limited proteolysis, strain specific migration patterns of PrPSc on polyacrylamide gels can be seen. DY PrPSc appears to be more protease sensitive than HY PrPSc producing a different banding pattern of PrPSc on Western blots following proteinase K treatment. This relates to different N-terminal ends of HY and DY PrPSc following protease treatment and implies differing conformations of HY and DY PrPSc (72 ). Furthermore, the demonstration that these strain specific physiochemical properties can be maintained during in vitro production of protease resistant PrP, when PrPC is mixed with HY or DY hamster PrPSc, further supports the concept that prion strains involve different PrP conformers (73 )..

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	43	Recently, several human PrPSc types have been identified which are associated with different phenotypes of CJD (62 ,74 ). The different fragment sizes seen on Western blots following treatment with proteinase K suggests that there are several different human PrPSc conformations. However, to fulfil the criteria of strains, these patterns must be transmissible to animals both in same and in different species. Remarkably, this is the case, with both PrPSc fragment sizes and the ratios of the three PrP glycoforms (diglycosylated, monoglycosylated and unglycosylated PrP) maintained on passage in transgenic mice expressing human PrP (62 ). Transmission of human prions and bovine prions to wild-type mice results in murine PrPSc with fragment sizes and glycoform ratios which correspond to the original inoculum (62 ). New variant CJD is associated with PrPSc glycoform ratios which are distinct from those seen in classical CJD. Similar ratios are seen in BSE and BSE when transmitted to several other species (62 ). These data strongly support the `protein only' hypothesis of infectivity and suggest that strain variation is encoded by a combination of PrP conformation and glycosylation. Transmission of PrPSc fragment sizes from two different sub-types of inherited prion disease to transgenic mice expressing a chimaeric human mouse PrP has also been reported (75 ). As PrP glycosylation is thought to be a co-translational process, the different glycoform ratios may represent selection of particular PrPC glycoforms by PrPSc of different conformations. According to such a hypothesis, PrP conformation would be the primary determinant of strain type with glycosylation being involved as a secondary process. However, since it is known that different cell types may glycosylate proteins differently, PrPSc glycosylation patterns may provide a substrate for the neuropathological targeting that distinguishes different prion strains. Particular PrPSc glycoforms may replicate most favourably in neuronal populations with a similar PrP glycoform expressed on the cell surface. Such targeting could also explain the different incubation periods which also discriminate strains, targeting of more critical brain regions, or regions with higher levels of PrP expression, producing shorter incubation periods..

Clearly, this cannot be measured directly since this would require inoculation of humans with BSE. However, transgenic models may offer a way to address this issue, at least in part. The principal determinants of the `species barrier' are the degree of homology between PrP molecules in the host and inoculum (32 ) and strain of agent; however, BSE appears to be caused by a single prion strain (69 ). Transgenic mice expressing human PrP, which are competent to produce human PrPSc and `human' prions on CJD challenge, offer an opportunity to address the issue as to whether it is possible for bovine prions to induce production of human PrPSc. To date results are reassuring. Incubation periods to BSE were unaltered in mice expressing human PrP in addition to mouse PrP, and only mouse PrPSc appeared to be produced (68 ). A potentially more revealing experiment is to challenge mice expressing only human PrP with BSE (68 ). No transmission occurred at incubation periods well beyond those of CJD in these mice (68 ); it remains to be seen if transmission will occur at longer incubation periods. These mice express valine at polymorphic codon 129 of PRNP and these studies are being repeated with mice transgenic for human PrP methionine 129. This is of particular importance given that all new variant CJD cases seen to date are methionine 129 homozygotes..

This polymorphism is a powerful determinant of the genetic susceptibility of humans toward both sporadic and acquired forms of prion disease and restricts propagation of particular prion strains. Despite its key role, we have no information on the effect of this mutation on the structure, stability, folding, and dynamics of the cellular form of PrP (PrPC). Here, we show that the mutation has no measurable effect on the folding, dynamics, and stability of PrPC. Our data indicate that the 129M/V polymorphism does not affect prion propagation through its effect on PrPC; rather, its influence is likely to be downstream in the disease mechanism. We infer that the M/V effect is mediated through the conformation or stability of disease-related PrP (PrPSc) or intermediates or on the kinetics of their formation..

It is now apparent that human prion strains are associated with the different biochemical features of PrPSc, with differences in PrPSc conformation and glycosylation that can be serially propagated in transgenic mice expressing human PrP (3, 5). The residue 129 HuPrP polymorphism appears to be able to affect the generation of these strain-specific PrPSc conformers and by inference the phenotype of human prion disease (22, 23). Such phenotypic effects of this polymorphism are also seen in inherited prion disease associated with the D178N mutation in PRNP, where this mutation may result in the phenotype of CJD or fatal familial insomnia, depending on the 129 genotype of the mutant allele (24)..

These are thought to represent distinct conformational states of PrPSc that differ in either the fold of the individual polypeptide chains or in the manner in which the chains are packed in a multimolecular complex or both. These states are manifested at the molecular level by (a) their response to cleavage by proteinase K and subsequent sizing of the resistant segment of polypeptide chain by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and (b) the ratio of diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated forms found in the protease-resistant PrPSc material. These PrPSc types are associated with distinct clinico-pathological phenotypes in affected patients. Types 1 to 3 are associated with classical CJD, whereas variant CJD is only associated with the type 4 strain (5). The propagation of these strain types is highly dependent upon the codon 129 genotype and hence the primary structure of the prion protein. For instance, the type 1 strain is only seen in methionine homozygotes, whereas the type 3 strain has not been seen on this genetic background. Most strikingly, variant CJD has only been seen to date in homozygous MM individuals..

The primer corresponding to the N-terminal region of PRNP to be expressed was designed to mutate a glycine at codon 90 to methionine and to incorporate a thrombin cleavage site, with the C-terminal primer replacing a methionine residue at 232 with a stop codon. Standard protocols for site-directed mutagenesis were used to create another construct with the valine at position 129..

Regions where the level of definition falls are associated with the loop connecting strand 2 of the -sheet and helix 2 (residues 167 to 171), the loop that connects helices II and III (residues 194 to 199), and the C terminus of helix 3 (residues 224 to 226) (Fig. 1A). The loop comprising residues 167 to 171 is characterized by extensive line broadening of NMR signals. This has been reported for a number of prion proteins from different species and is due to conformational exchange between two or more backbone conformations, on the millisecond time scale, which results in broadening of NMR signals. The lack of definition observed within the NMR ensemble for this region of the protein is thus due to lack of constraints, as well as conformational averaging. The increased disorder seen in the other less defined regions, however, appears to be due to conformational equilibria on a faster time scale and is discussed later..

G. Dodson in advance of publication. A, superposition of secondary structure elements. Residues 125 to 226 are shown. The position of residue 129 is marked with a sphere. Residues 187 to 195 have been removed from the backbone trace of the HuPrP(129M) crystal structure, since this region is perturbed in the three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer). B, comparison of side chain packing and hydrogen bonding surrounding the residue 129 polymorphism. Backbone traces of residues 127 to 131, 160 to 165, and 176 to 180 are shown together with the side chains of Tyr128, Met/Val129, Arg164, and Asp178..
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	46	  The site surrounding the polymorphism is better defined, allowing a detailed examination of the effect of the methionine to valine substitution at position 129 (Fig. 2B). For this, we have compared the HuPrP(129V) NMR structure with the high resolution crystal structures of human (52) and sheep prion protein (49), as well as the HuPrP(129M) NMR structure, all of which contain methionine at position 129. Overall, the region surrounding the polymorphism is remarkably similar between the two forms (Fig. 2B). The methionine and valine side chains are well defined in the NMR structure ensemble, and both occupy similar spatial regions, with no significant deformation of the residues surrounding the polymorphism site with either residue. This is of particular interest, since a D178N mutation is associated with a clinico-pathological phenotype of FFI when residue 129 is methionine and of CJD when it is valine. It has been proposed that the side chains of residues 129 and 178 interact via hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Tyr128, Arg164, and Asp178 (24, 53) (although in the averaged NMR structure of HuPrP(129M), the side chain of Arg164 is not in a position to accomplish this (51)). The side chains of these residues are well defined in the HuPrP(129V) NMR structure, and NOEs between the backbone and side chain resonances of residues 128, 129, 164, and 178 are observed. From the distribution of conformations within the NMR ensemble, it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether the side chains of Tyr128, Arg164, and Asp178 are hydrogen-bonded to each other, but these residues are sufficiently close in individual members of the ensemble for this hydrogen-bonding to be present. Hence, the close association of the side chains of residues 128, 164, and 178 is maintained in both polymorphs, and there does not appear to be a significant disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network surrounding residue 129 (Fig. 2B). This conclusion is further supported by amide exchange and chemical shift data described below. Thus, the effect of residue 129 in the D178N mutation does not appear to be resolvable through examination of the structure surrounding the polymorphism..

To assess this, the folding behavior of both species was determined in detail..

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	49	First, the equilibrium unfolding behavior of both polymorphs was examined; the equilibrium denaturation profiles of both species are shown in Fig. 3A. The amide and aromatic CD curves show that both molecules denature in a single co-operative transition, without the formation of any populated intermediate species during equilibrium unfolding. The equilibrium constant between the native and unfolded states derived from these unfolding curves for both proteins are, within error, the same, at 5000. This finding is similar to that obtained when the methionine of the mouse prion protein is substituted with valine (54)..

The lines superimposed upon the data are fits to Equation 1. B, amide protection factors (kex/kint) in HuPrP(129M) and HuPrP(129V) for those residues with measurable protection. (Those additional residues that appear protected in HuPrP(129V) are due to peak overlap in HuPrP(129M), which precluded measurement of those peaks.) The protection factor corresponding with the equilibrium constant between the native (N) and unfolded (U) states of the protein is plotted as a dashed line (log10K(N/U)). Regions of highest protection surround the disulfide bond that links helices II and III and that forms a core of residual structure in what is believed to be the unfolded state of the protein. C, chemical shift differences of C nuclei between HuPrP(129V) and HuPrP(129M) at pH 5.55 and 30  degrees C. Regions of secondary structure in HuPrP are denoted by arrows (-strands) and cylinders (-helices). The chemical shift differences of residue 129 have been corrected for the intrinsic chemical shift differences of methionine and valine in an extended -strand (60)..
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	51	  Although this indicates that both proteins have the same overall stability for the folded state and that the residue 129 polymorphism does not appear to be acting on prion disease by altering the fold stability of PrPC, this does not exclude the possibility of other folding intermediates that are transiently populated in the folding process being present to differing degrees in both forms of the protein..
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	52	To investigate this, the rates of hydrogen/deuterium exchange for backbone amide resonances were determined, which has been used to identify regions of the protein that remain hydrogen-bonded until the protein becomes unfolded (Fig. 3B) (55). The observed amide exchange protection data shows that the stabilities of secondary structure elements are very similar in both polymorphs. The regions of highest stability within both forms of the protein are located in the three helical regions of the protein that associate to form the core of the molecule. For both forms of PrPC, the protection factors show the stability of these secondary structure elements to be equivalent to the equilibrium constant between native and unfolded states of the protein. The only regions of the protein where this is not the case are the region centered around the disulfide bond that links helices 2 and 3 and the first strand of the -sheet, where the polymorphism resides. The former displays anomalously high protection factors, due to residual local structure in the unfolded state of the protein (55). The latter region, however, displays protection factors that are below the detectable limit (50 under the conditions of the present experiment). However, protection factors for residues 161 and 163, which are on the other strand of the -sheet, exhibit similar protection factors in both forms of PrPC. Thus, although we can say that substitution of valine for methionine has not significantly increased the stability of hydrogen bonds surrounding residue 129 to a level where protection is observable (50), it does not appear to have significantly affected the stability of hydrogen bonds associated with the opposite side of the -sheet. We can therefore conclude that for both forms of HuPrP, there are no significantly populated species, either folding intermediates or alternatively folded states in which the three helical and second -strand core of the protein is disrupted, and that the effect of the polymorphism on PrPC (if any) is likely to be outside of this core region..
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	53	Some secondary structure elements of the protein show very little protection from exchange. For example, the C-terminal regions of helix II (residues 186 to 194) and helix III (residues 219 to 226) and the first strand of the -sheet exhibit protection factors below the detectable limit, consistent with a significant level of conformational flexibility in these regions of the protein. In the case of the -sheet, this conclusion is supported by weak, broadened 1H15N HSQC signals observed from this region (residues 129 to 131 and 161 to 164), whereas for the helical regions, although downfield-shifted C chemical shifts characteristic of -helical structure are observed, the downfield shift is reduced, consistent with these regions being in equilibrium with more unfolded structures (data not shown)..

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	55	The higher conformational variability in the C termini of these helices in comparison with the core of the protein is further supported by small chemical shift differences between the M and V polymorphs. These chemical shift differences are small but lie outside the uncertainty in measurement. The changes in C chemical shifts indicate that there is a slight stabilization of the C terminus of helix III, and destabilization of the C terminus of Helix II in HuPrP(129V) compared with HuPrP(129M). In previous studies, chemical shift differences in these regions of the protein between different PrP constructs have been variously ascribed to small pH differences between samples or to transient interactions between the folded domain and the unstructured N terminus of the protein (51, 56). The chemical shift differences observed here lie outside those caused by uncertainty in the precise pH of the solutions and indicate a difference in the distribution of stability throughout the molecule, implying a possible role for the polymorphism. Chemical shift changes immediately adjacent to the polymorphism are, however, harder to interpret, since there are inevitably changes that are associated with the change in chemical composition. Indeed, the sequence surrounding a residue can cause a change in C chemical shift on the order of  plus or minus 0.2 to 0.3 ppm in unfolded proteins, which is larger than the chemical shift changes observed adjacent to the polymorphism (57). Any changes in conformation reported by these chemical shift perturbations are small, since they do not affect the observed structure or stability of the protein and reflect small changes in the population distribution of the structural ensemble, which fall within the resolution of the solution structure..

The steady-state 15N{1H} NOEs and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 (15N) and T2 (15N)) for the folded, well defined, regions of HuPrP(129V) are characteristic of a globular protein of this size. In particular, residues within the -sheet region, where the polymorphism resides, do not exhibit dynamic properties significantly different from the rest of the protein, despite the low amide protection factors and broadened 15N1H HSQC signals. Residues 190 to 199, however, which link helices II and III, display smaller but still positive 15N{1H} NOE values (and slightly increased T2 values), indicating that these residues are indeed relatively more flexible than the structured parts of the protein, resulting in the decreased definition in the NMR structure ensemble for this region. The degree of flexibility for this region is still significantly less than the N and C termini of the protein (residues 91 to 124 and 227 to 231), which display large negative 15N{1H} NOE values indicative of molecular motions on the subnanosecond time scale, consistent with previous observations that they are unstructured. The increased flexibility within the C terminus of helix III appears to extend to residue 220 and is consistent with the lack of amide exchange and the reduced downfield C chemical shifts..

Individuals with an MV genotype are highly protected against developing sporadic and acquired prion disease. This effect can be explained by the principle of molecular complementarity combined with a gene dosage effect. In other words, if there is a spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and only identical molecules can be recruited in the propagation process due to structural complementarity, then a homozygote will have a double dose of available substrate; hence, the probability of initiation and/or the rate of propagation will be enhanced..

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	64	The above arguments establish the general point that the residue 129 polymorphism confers different molecular properties on the prion protein and that these properties strongly influence both susceptibility to disease and the conformation of PrPSc. It follows that an understanding of the mechanism underlying this methionine/valine effect would provide valuable insights into the process by which the cellular conformation of the protein is converted to the disease-related PrPSc state. To this end, we addressed the question of whether the influence of the M and V residues at this position results from changes in the conformation and stability of PrPC. Our results establish a close similarity of the valine and methionine forms of the protein in the PrPC conformation. No obvious effect on the side chain packing or dynamics in the region surrounding the mutation are discernible in the structural ensemble calculated from NOE-derived constraints, and chemical shift data for this region also show remarkably little difference between the two sequences. In addition, the polymorphism does not affect the global stability of the molecule, as evidenced by the lack of effect on the denaturant-induced unfolding transition and on the hydrogen exchange behavior. The latter measurements also probe the propensity for local regions of the protein to unfold or for the protein to adopt less stable, alternative conformations. In these respects, also, the methionine and valine forms behave identically..

They include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)1 in cattle, and several human diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Since its first recognition in 1986, BSE reached epidemic proportions in the UK (1), and there is substantial evidence that a new variant of CJD may be because of consumption of BSE-contaminated products (2)..

Currently, the most widely accepted proposal is the "protein only" hypothesis, first outlined in general terms by Griffith (4) and enunciated in its updated and detailed form by Prusiner (5, 6). It proposes that the prion is identical with a conformational isoform of PrPC (5), a normal host protein (7-9) found predominantly on the outer surface of neurons. Introduction of the abnormal conformer into the organism would result in the conversion of PrPC into a likeness of itself (Fig. 1)..

B, the protein only model assumes that the prion is identical with PrPSc (or PrP*). Exogenous prions cause the conversion of the normal cellular protein PrPC into PrPSc, either at the cell surface or after internalization. C, PrPSc accumulates intracellularly in late endosomes or lysosomes, and the cell surface is depleted of PrPC. PrPSc is also released into the extracellular space..

Prusiner and co-workers (11) proposed that PrPSc is the main or only constituent of the prion. Because no chemical differences were found between PrPC and PrPSc, the two species are believed to differ in their conformation. The three-dimensional structure of PrPC has been elucidated (12) but not that of PrPSc; however, the -sheet content of PrPSc was found to be high whereas that of PrPC is low (13). Because the ratio of infectious units to PrPSc molecules is only about 1:100,000 (14), the structure of the PrP molecule actually associated with infectivity cannot be definitively inferred. For this reason the PrP species responsible for infectivity is presently better designated as PrP* (15). The conclusion that some form of PrP is the essential (perhaps only) constituent of the infectious agent is based on compelling biochemical and genetical evidence (5, 16).     Familial Spongiform Encephalopathies Are Associated with Mutations in the PrP Gene.

It is believed that these mutations allow spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc with a frequency sufficient to cause disease within the lifetime of the individual (5, 19). Sporadic CJD could be attributed to rare instances of spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc or rare somatic mutations in the Prnp gene. In both cases the initial conversion would be followed by autocatalytic propagation. Mice overexpressing a murine PrP transgene with a mutation corresponding to the human GSS mutation Pro-102  Leu spontaneously contract a lethal scrapie-like disease, and it has been reported that this disease can be transmitted to mice expressing the same mutant transgene at lower levels, which do not lead to spontaneous disease (20, 21)..

The top rectangle represents the coding region of the human PrP gene; the hatched green areas indicate the amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences, and the five dark green boxes (R) are the "octa repeats," sequences of 8 amino acids. The red arrows indicate amino acid replacements in individual mutant PrP genes. The diseases associated with these mutations are given in blue (CJD, GSS, FFI). The Met-129  Val replacement represents a polymorphism, which in itself is not associated with disease; however, it modifies the effects of the Asp-178  Asn mutation, such that when the latter is combined with Met-129 it is associated with FFI and when combined with Val-129 it is associated with CJD. Amplification of the number of octa repeats has been found in cases of familial CJD and GSS.     Mice Devoid of PrPC Are Resistant to Scrapie.

Mice devoid of PrP (Prnpo/o) were generated by homologous recombination and found to be essentially normal (22). When challenged with mouse prions, mice devoid of PrP were completely protected against scrapie disease, and prions failed to accumulate in spleen and brain, in contrast to wild-type mice (23, 24). Introduction of murine Prnp transgenes into Prnpo/o mice resulted in several lines with varying expression levels of PrPC, which were susceptible to mouse prions; the higher the PrPC content of the brain, the shorter the incubation times (25)..

Intracerebral inoculation of such engrafted mice leads to typical scrapie pathology in the graft but not in the surrounding Prnpo/o tissue (26). However, because intraperitoneal inoculation of these mice does not lead to pathology in the Prnp+/+ graft, transport of prions from the periphery to the CNS is seen to require interposed PrP-bearing tissue (27). It has also been shown that Prnp+/+ immunodeficient mice lacking mature B cells fail to transport prions from the periphery to the CNS, suggesting a role of the lymphoreticular system in transport (28). It is believed that the follicular dendritic cells, which depend on B cells for their maintenance in a mature state, are the site of prion replication in the spleen (29, 30) and that transport to the CNS is, in addition, dependent on the peripheral nervous system (31).     The Species Barrier Is Abolished by Introducing the PrP Transgene of the Prion Donor into the Recipient.

In the case of prion transmission from hamsters to mice, this so-called species barrier was overcome by introducing hamster Prnp transgenes into recipient wild-type mice (32, 33). Importantly, the properties of the prions produced in these transgenic mice corresponded to the prion species used for inoculation (32), that is infection with hamster prions led to production of hamster prions, but infection with mouse prions gave rise to mouse prions. Within the framework of the "protein only" hypothesis this means that hamster PrPC but not murine PrPC (which differs from the former by 10 amino acids) is a suitable substrate for conversion to hamster PrPSc by hamster prions and vice versa. Interestingly, susceptibility of the mouse to prions from other species, such as hamster, mouse, or man, is increased when the PrP transgenes are introduced into a PrP knockout mouse, suggesting that the resident murine gene inhibits the propagation of the alien prions (23).

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	21	Dickinson and colleagues (34, 35) showed that many distinct strains of scrapie prions can be derived from sheep isolates. These strains differ by their incubation times in various inbred mouse lines and by the lesion patterns they occasion in the affected brains. Interestingly, different strains can be propagated in one inbred mouse strain (homozygous with regard to its PrP gene) (35). Within the framework of the protein only hypothesis this is at first blush puzzling, because it means that one and the same polypeptide chain is able to mediate different strain phenotypes. The conformational hypothesis proposes that each strain is associated with a different conformation of PrPSc (or PrP*) and that each of these can convert the PrPC of its host into a likeness of itself (19). Marsh and colleagues (36) showed that the PrPSc species associated with two hamster-adapted scrapie strains, HY and DY, are cleaved to products of different length by proteinase K; the different susceptibility to protease is readily explained by different conformations. Similar findings were made with other prion strains propagated in the mouse (37, 38). Moreover, PrPSc of certain strains differ in the ratio of the diglycosylated to the monoglycosylated form (39)..

It has recently been claimed that PrPSc molecules of as many as eight different strains could be differentiated by virtue of their relative affinity for a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope that is fully available in PrPC but partially occluded in PrPSc. In addition, some strains differed in their susceptibility to denaturation by guanidinium chloride, adding further credibility to the conformational hypothesis of strain specificity (40).

The Conversion Reaction.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	25	Conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in scrapie-infected cells is a late post-translational process, occurring after PrPC has reached its normal extracellular location or thereafter (41). Why is spontaneous formation of PrPSc an extremely rare event and how does scrapie infection promote conversion? The "refolding model" (Fig. 3A) proposes that conversion requires that PrPC be unfolded to some extent and refolded under the influence of a PrPSc molecule (19), a process that would have to overcome a high activation energy barrier and might require a chaperone and an energy source. The "nucleation model" (Fig. 3B) proposes that PrPC is in equilibrium with PrPSc (or a precursor thereof) and that PrPSc is only stabilized when it adds onto a crystal-like seed or aggregate of PrPSc. If a stable aggregate needs to consist minimally of a substantial number of PrPSc molecules, then its spontaneous formation would be a very rare event. However, once a seed is present, monomer addition could ensue at a rapid rate (42-44). Trapping of PrP by essentially irreversible aggregation would drive the bulk conversion process. The proposed process is akin to the assembly of (protease-sensitive) flagellin to (protease-resistant) flagellar filaments (45). Interestingly, the same flagellin molecule can assemble into two types of flagella, depending on the provenance of the seed (46), thereby providing an analogy for conformationally determined prion strain specificity..

Why is spontaneous formation of PrPSc an extremely rare event and how does scrapie infection promote conversion? The "refolding model" (Fig. 3A) proposes that conversion requires that PrPC be unfolded to some extent and refolded under the influence of a PrPSc molecule (19), a process that would have to overcome a high activation energy barrier and might require a chaperone and an energy source. The "nucleation model" (Fig. 3B) proposes that PrPC is in equilibrium with PrPSc (or a precursor thereof) and that PrPSc is only stabilized when it adds onto a crystal-like seed or aggregate of PrPSc. If a stable aggregate needs to consist minimally of a substantial number of PrPSc molecules, then its spontaneous formation would be a very rare event. However, once a seed is present, monomer addition could ensue at a rapid rate (42-44). Trapping of PrP by essentially irreversible aggregation would drive the bulk conversion process. The proposed process is akin to the assembly of (protease-sensitive) flagellin to (protease-resistant) flagellar filaments (45). Interestingly, the same flagellin molecule can assemble into two types of flagella, depending on the provenance of the seed (46), thereby providing an analogy for conformationally determined prion strain specificity..

The conformational change is kinetically controlled, a high activation energy barrier preventing spontaneous conversion at detectable rates. Interaction with exogenously introduced PrPSc causes PrPC to undergo an induced conformational change to yield PrPSc. This reaction may involve extensive unfolding and refolding of the protein to explain the postulated high energy barrier and could be dependent on an enzyme or chaperone. In the case of certain mutations in PrPC (see Fig. 2), spontaneous conversion to PrPSc may occur as a rare event, explaining why familial CJD or GSS arises spontaneously, albeit late in life. Sporadic CJD may come about when an extremely rare event (occurring in one among a million individuals per year) leads to spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and gives rise to a conversion cascade (5, 32). B, the "seeding" model. PrPC and PrPSc (or a PrPSc-like molecule) are in equilibrium strongly favoring PrPC. PrPSc is only stabilized when it adds onto a crystal-like seed or aggregate of PrPSc. Seed formation is a rare event; once a seed is present, monomer addition can ensue at a rapid rate (43, 44). To explain exponential conversion rates, it must be assumed that the aggregates are continuously fragmented to present increasing surface for accretion..

The conversion reaction exhibited the "species specificity" observed in vivo; thus PrPC from mouse was readily converted to protease resistance by murine PrPSc but poorly by bovine PrPSc and vice versa (48). Moreover, even strain specificity has been demonstrated in this type of reaction, in that labeled PrPC incubated with PrPSc from the DY or the HY hamster transmissible mink encephalopathy strains described above yielded labeled PrPSc with the properties typical for the input PrPSc (49). Despite efforts by several groups, it has not been possible to demonstrate net synthesis of infectivity over the background given by the PrPSc preparation.     Implications and Outlook.

Eight hundred or so ommatidia begin differentiation in about 30 columns. Adjacent columns begin differentiation approximately 90 minutes apart, so that it takes about two days before the entire retinal field is differentiating. The advancing anterior boundary of the differentiating region is morphologically recognizable from an indentation known as the morphogenetic furrow, and is associated with changes in cell cycle, adhesion and gene expression (Wolff and Ready, 1993; Heberlein and Moses, 1995; Lee and Treisman, 2002). A potentially similar wave of differentiation also occurs in zebrafish retina (Neumann and Nusslein-Volhard, 2000; Stenkamp et al., 2000)..

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	8	Progression of the morphogenetic furrow depends primarily on Hedgehog, which is secreted by differentiating photoreceptor neurons. Hedgehog is necessary for furrow progression (Ma et al., 1993). Ectopic Hh expression is sufficient to initiate ectopic furrows in the anterior undifferentiated region (Heberlein et al., 1995). Despite the primary role of Hh, cells unable to receive Hh signals are still able to differentiate because Hh triggers the secretion of secondary signals, and cells unable to respond to Hh still respond to these other signals (Strutt and Mlodzik, 1997). Dpp is one important secondary signal, and acts redundantly with Hh. Cells must be able to respond to either Hh or Dpp to begin differentiating (Heberlein et al., 1993; Greenwood and Struhl, 1999; Curtiss and Mlodzik, 2000). It has been proposed that Notch signaling also contributes (Baker and Yu, 1997; Li and Baker, 2001). Ectopic Notch and Dpp together can initiate differentiation as effectively as ectopic Hh does (Baonza and Freeman, 2001)..

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	12	Although redundant functions can be studied through ectopic expression experiments, a loss-of-function approach that removes components from the redundant pathways has the advantage of addressing gene function at the normal time and place, and at normal expression levels. As each of Hh, Dpp and N signals are important many times during Drosophila development from embryogenesis onwards, it was necessary to use a conditional genetic approach. We employed mosaic analysis using the FLP/FRT system to obtain clones of retinal cells lacking function of Hh, Dpp and N pathway components. Each of these genes also plays roles in the initiation of the morphogenetic furrow at the posterior margin of the eye field, so that furrow initiation fails when eye margin cells are mutated, leaving the region to the anterior undifferentiated (Lee and Treisman, 2002).

As each of Hh, Dpp and N signals are important many times during Drosophila development from embryogenesis onwards, it was necessary to use a conditional genetic approach. We employed mosaic analysis using the FLP/FRT system to obtain clones of retinal cells lacking function of Hh, Dpp and N pathway components. Each of these genes also plays roles in the initiation of the morphogenetic furrow at the posterior margin of the eye field, so that furrow initiation fails when eye margin cells are mutated, leaving the region to the anterior undifferentiated (Lee and Treisman, 2002).

Atonal expression is transient, whereas Senseless is maintained in differentiating R8 cells throughout the eye disc (Nolo et al., 2000) (Fig. 1). hairy encodes a negative regulator of Atonal function, and is expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow and downregulated as differentiation begins (Fig. 1) (Brown et al., 1995). Notch activation downregulates Hairy (Baonza and Freeman, 2001). These events coincide with peak Hh signal at the anterior of the morphogenetic furrow, as revealed by accumulation of the Ci155 protein (Motzny and Holmgren, 1995; Strutt and Mlodzik, 1996) (Fig. 1)..

Atonal expression was reduced, although eye patterning occurred normally (data not shown). Fng:Gal4 (a gift of M. Mlodzik) was used to misexpress UAS:ciCell ventrally (Fig. 3F). When expressed under the control of Fng:Gal4, ciCell prevented furrow progression and differentiation in ventral cells, but permitted furrow progression across the dorsal region of the eye disc (Fig. 3G). Fng:G4 and hH10 were also used to drive expression of UAS:ciU, which encodes a Ci protein with a deletion of amino acids 611-760, which is defective in processing to Ci75 and which behaves as a Hh-dependent activator protein (Methot and Basler, 1999), and UAS:ZnAD and UAS:ZnRD transgenes, in which the DNA binding domain of Ci was coupled to transcriptional activator and repressor domains, respectively (Hepker et al., 1997). These were without detectable effect (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggested that differentiation might depend on blocking production of Ci75 in response to Hh or Dpp..

Clones of mutant cells are revealed by the absence of Ci155 (red; panels A-F), or absence of the lacZ marker gene (red; panels G,H). In E-H, outlines of clone boundaries have been overlaid on the Hairy channel to help assess autonomy. Because of variations in reagents and procedures over time (see Materials and methods), labeling intensities can only rigorously be compared between cells of different genotypes within the same preparation. (A) Differentiation is delayed in Mad ci-mutant cells. (B) Mad ci-mutant cells maintain Hairy expression longer, except where they are close to wild-type cells. If wild-type cells are nearby, Hairy expression is lost close to the normal time (e.g. arrow). (C) tkv ci-mutant cells do not differentiate. (D) tkv ci-mutant cells maintain Hairy expression longer, except where they are close to wild-type cells. If wild-type cells are nearby, Hairy is lost close to the normal time (e.g. arrow). In addition, Hairy levels are reproducibly lower in mutant cells than in wild type. (E) Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells do not differentiate. Mutant cells maintain Hairy expression indefinitely, even where they are neighboring wild-type cells. (F) Differentiation of Su(H) ci-mutant cells is slightly delayed. There is an excess of Senseless-expressing R8 cells, though not so extreme as in Su(H)-mutant clones (compare with panel G). Su(H) ci-mutant cells maintain Hairy expression indefinitely, even where they are neighboring wild-type cells. Note the overlap between Senseless-expressing and Hairy-expressing regions. (G) Su(H)-mutant cells differentiate at or before the normal time and are strongly neurogenic (Li and Baker, 2001). Weak Hairy expression is maintained after the normal time but it is soon lost.

(A) Cell autonomous responses of Atonal and Hairy expression to Dpp, Hh and N signal reception as inferred from our results, illustrating the roles of Ci155 and Ci75. Positive and negative interactions do not imply that direct molecular interactions between proteins or between proteins and genes have been demonstrated, only that interactions occur within the same cell without further intercellular signals. Ci75 must repress Ato since mutation of smo imposes a delay on differentiation that is released by deleting ci. Ci155 must activate Ato since Mad Su(H) cells differentiate but Mad Su(H) ci cells do not. Tkv must activate Ato independently of Ci because ci cells differentiate normally but tkv ci and Mad ci cells do not. Tkv is shown inhibiting Ci75, because Tkv promotes Ci155 accumulation in smo-mutant cells; this Ci155 is presumed to be inactive. Tkv also promotes Ci155 accumulation in cells not mutant for smo. Hairy has been shown previously to repress Ato function (Brown et al., 1995). Ci155 must repress Hairy as Hairy is maintained cell autonomously by Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells but can be downregulated by Mad Su(H) cells. N must repress Hairy as Hairy is maintained cell autonomously by Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells but can be downregulated by Mad ci cells. N may activate Atonal independently of Hairy as well, because the furrow progresses faster through Su(H)-mutant clones where Hairy is still expressed (Li and Baker, 2001). Hairy expression must be initiated in part by another signal, although Dpp has an input, as revealed by the quantitative reduction of Hairy levels in cells mutant for tkv (Greenwood and Struhl, 1999) and Mad, and all their combinations with Su(H) and ci. The network accounts for all the mutant phenotypes. In the absence of Ci, normal differentiation occurs in response to Dpp and N. In the absence of smo, differentiation is delayed because activation pathways through Ci155 are lost but repression by Ci75 retained. In the absence of both Dpp and N, differentiation occurs in response to Hh. Absence of either tkv or N alone has little effect, reflecting either the dominant role of Hh, or perhaps that both positive and negative inputs are lost in each case. (B) Extracellular signaling to Atonal and Hairy. Hh, Dl and Dpp are shown at the locations of their expression. The signal acting most anteriorly to the morphogenetic furrow is Dpp. Dpp is expressed at the anterior of the morphogenetic furrow in response to Hh. Dpp promotes Hairy expression. More posteriorly, Dpp synergizes with the relatively indiffusible Dl signal to induce Atonal. Dl is expressed in response to Atonal, and later in response to activation of Egfr by ligands produced by Atonal-dependent R8 cells. Hh also induces Atonal through the Ci155/Ci75 ratio. Hh is secreted by photoreceptor cells specified by Egfr activation by ligands produced by Atonal-dependent R8 cells. Both N and Hh downregulate Hairy. Despite intrinsically different ranges of Dpp and Hh signals, their activation of Ato coincides because Dpp also elevates Hairy, which must be downregulated by Hh or Dl..
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	93	  The development of Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells is a helpful starting point, as they may reflect a `ground state' of eye development that requires extracellular signals to differentiate. Mad Su(H) ci cells fail to express the atonal or senseless genes that initiate R8 differentiation, and, consequently, fail to support retinal differentiation. This shows that the absence of Ci75 is not sufficient for differentiation. Dpp alone can induce Ato (e.g. in Su(H) ci clones), but N and Dpp signaling together are required to activate Atonal with normal kinetics, as occurs in ci-mutant cells. N signaling alone (in tkv ci clones) is insufficient. In the presence of Ci, prompt differentiation required Hh to downregulate Ci75, and differentiation was delayed in Smo clones that lacked this input. The normal role of Hh is not just to remove Ci75 thus permitting Dpp and N to work, because Atonal is turned on normally in Mad Su(H) clones that do not respond to Dpp or N signals. Such differentiation depends exclusively on Hh yet progresses normally, except that a neurogenic phenotype reflects dependence of lateral inhibition on Su(H). Hh depends positively on ci to drive differentiation in Mad Su(H) cells and, therefore, requires Ci155. The positive role of ci can also be inferred from the delayed differentiation of Su(H) ci clones in comparison with Su(H) clones..

Dpp alone can induce Ato (e.g. in Su(H) ci clones), but N and Dpp signaling together are required to activate Atonal with normal kinetics, as occurs in ci-mutant cells. N signaling alone (in tkv ci clones) is insufficient. In the presence of Ci, prompt differentiation required Hh to downregulate Ci75, and differentiation was delayed in Smo clones that lacked this input. The normal role of Hh is not just to remove Ci75 thus permitting Dpp and N to work, because Atonal is turned on normally in Mad Su(H) clones that do not respond to Dpp or N signals. Such differentiation depends exclusively on Hh yet progresses normally, except that a neurogenic phenotype reflects dependence of lateral inhibition on Su(H). Hh depends positively on ci to drive differentiation in Mad Su(H) cells and, therefore, requires Ci155. The positive role of ci can also be inferred from the delayed differentiation of Su(H) ci clones in comparison with Su(H) clones..

Prolonged Hairy expression is not sufficient to block differentiation completely but it does antagonize it (e.g. in Su(H) ci clones). Downregulation of Hairy in response to Hh as well as N explains why both ci and Su(H) mutant clones can differentiate promptly, and why N enhances differentiation in response to Dpp but is not required for differentiation in response to Hh..

This discrepancy is probably explained by the baseline repressor activity of Su(H) protein (Hsieh and Hayward, 1995; Morel and Schweisguth, 2000). Our previous work shows that without N signaling, repressor activity of Su(H) protein retards differentiation (Li and Baker, 2001). Dpp signaling is sufficient for differentiation in our experiments where the Su(H) gene has been deleted. In the presence of the Su(H) gene, Dpp may be most effective at locations where there is little Su(H) repressor activity, such as close to the morphogenetic furrow where N signaling is active..

First, our results show that Mad and Ci independently reinforce differentiation, presumably through the transcription of target genes because Mad is sufficient for differentiation in the absence of Ci, and vice versa. Our results show unequivocally that the transcriptional activator Ci155 activates differentiation in addition to Ci75 antagonizing differentiation..
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	106	It was surprising to find that Dpp stabilizes Ci155 in the absence of Smo, which suggested Dpp input into Hh signal transduction. Although the requirement for smo-dependent input through fused makes it unlikely that Ci155 is functional in smo clones (Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1997; Methot and Basler, 1999), Ci155 accumulation might be associated with reduced Ci75 levels. Ci75 is shown to repress differentiation in smo clones because smo ci clones differentiation normally. Ci155 stabilization cannot be due to an indirect effect of Dpp signaling on Hh, Ptc or Smo expression levels because the effect is detected in the absence of smo, and, therefore, reflects an effect on Hh signal transduction components downstream of Smo. One idea is that Dpp signaling (or Dpp-induced differentiation) may replace SCFSlimb processing of Ci (which cleaves Ci155 to Ci75) with Cullin3-mediated Ci degradation, just as normally occurs posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (Ou et al., 2002). In a smo clone, Ci155 would accumulate because Smo is required for Cullin3 to degrade Ci (Ou et al., 2002) (N.E.B., unpublished). However, the SCFSlimb-to-Cullin3 switch may not be the only effect of Dpp on Ci processing, because Tkv slightly enhanced Ci155 accumulation even when smo is present (Fig. 2E)..

The range of Hh diffusion depends in part on the shape of the morphogenetic furrow cells (Benlali et al., 2000). The Dpp that drives differentiation through ci-mutant cells unable to respond to Hh must diffuse from outside the ci clones because Dpp synthesis is Hh dependent (Heberlein et al., 1993; Methot and Basler, 1999). Large ci clones develop normally so Dpp diffusion cannot be limiting (dpp-mutant clones offer no information about the range of Dpp because they express and differentiate in response to Hh). Instead the rate of progression in response to Dpp is controlled by Dl. Dl signals over, at most, one or two cell diameters at the morphogenetic furrow (Baker and Yu, 1997)..

A line of PrP-deficient mice, Ngsk Prnp0/0, ectopically expressing PrPLP/Dpl in neurons, exhibits late-onset ataxia because of Purkinje cell death that is prevented by a transgene encoding wild-type mouse PrP. To elucidate the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in these mice, we introduced five types of PrP transgene, namely one heterologous hamster, two mouse/hamster chimeric genes, and two mutants, each of which encoded PrP lacking residues 23 to 88 (MHM2.del23 to 88) or with E199K substitution (Mo.E199K), into Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. Only MHM2.del23 to 88 failed to rescue the mice from the Purkinje cell death. The transgenic mice, MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0, expressed several times more PrP than did wild-type (Prnp+/+) mice and PrPLP/Dpl at an equivalent level to Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. Little difference was observed in the pathology and onset of ataxia between Ngsk Prnp0/0 and MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0. No detergent-insoluble PrPLP/Dpl was detectable in the central nervous system of Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice even after the onset of ataxia. Our findings provide evidence that the N-terminal residues 23 to 88 of PrP containing the unique octapeptide-repeat region is crucial for preventing Purkinje cell death in Prnp0/0 mice expressing PrPLP/Dpl in the neuron..

Subsequently, these results were reproduced in two independent lines, Rcm0 and Zrch II Prnp0/0 mice (6, 7). In contrast, two other independent lines, Zrch I and Edbg Prnp0/0, have never revealed such a phenotype (8, 9). Recent studies have provided evidence that the ectopic expression of a PrP-like protein/Doppel (PrPLP/Dpl) in the neuron of ataxic Prnp0/0 mouse lines but not non-ataxic lines could explain the discrepancy between phenotypes (6, 10). Disruption of a part of the Prnp intron 2, including its splicing acceptor, in all the ataxic lines leads to unusual intergenic splicing between Prnp and the downstream gene, designated Prnd, encoding PrPLP/Dpl. As a consequence, the PrPLP/Dpl gene comes under the control of the Prnp promoter, leading to the ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl in the neuron. In the physiological situation, PrPLP/Dpl mRNA is expressed at a high level in the testis and heart but is not detectable in the brain except for transient expression by brain endothelial cells around 1 week after birth (11). A study using PrPLP/Dpl-deficient mice has suggested a physiological role for PrPLP/Dpl in spermatogenesis (12). Recent reports demonstrated that introduction of a transgene encoding PrPLP/Dpl rendered Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice capable of reproducing the Purkinje cell degeneration observed in the Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice (13). This is direct evidence confirming that both ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl and functional loss of PrP are required for the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice..

In the current study, we introduced five types of PrP transgene into Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice by mating them with the transgenic mouse lines, each harboring the corresponding transgene with the Zrch I Prnp0/0 background (8). Drs. P. Tremblay and S. B. Prusiner, University of California, San Francisco, CA kindly provided the Tg mouse lines. The transgenes included a Syrian hamster wild-type PrP gene (SHa); two SHa/mouse chimeric PrP genes (MH2M and MHM2), MHM2 lacking residues 23 to 88 (MHM2.del23 to 88); and Mo.PrP gene with E199K substitution (Mo.E199K) (17 to 20). They were constructed in a cosSHa.Tet. vector, encompassing the entire SHa Prnp locus but not containing the PrPLP/Dpl locus (Prnd) (6). MHM2 PrP has two amino acid substitutions from Mo.PrP, L108M and V111M, which are included in the epitope recognized by 3F4 anti-PrP antibody. MH2M PrP has five amino acid substitutions (L108M, V111M, I138M, Y154N, and S169N) from Mo.PrP. The E199K substitution in Mo.E199K PrP corresponds to that found in patients with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (21). Offspring carrying the transgenes were identified by PCR of tail DNA as described previously (5). To distinguish Ngsk from Zrch I Prnp0/0 genotypes, both a Zrch I-specific primer pair (MP685S, 5'-AACTTCACCGAGACCGATGT and MP215A, 5'-GAACCCTTTGCCTATGCTAA) and a Ngsk-specific primer pair (PGK468S, 5'-CGCTGTTCTCCTCTTCCTCA and NEO390A, 5'-GGTAGCCGGATCAAGCGTAT) were used in the PCR. The F2 offspring carrying transgenes with Ngsk Prnp0/0 background, Tg/Ngsk Prnp0/0, were subjected to analysis..

All the Tg/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice developed normally and initially showed no neurological symptoms. At about 13 months after birth, however, Tg-MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice, as well as Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice lacking a PrP transgene, began to exhibit progressive symptoms of ataxia, such as tremor and gait disturbance (Fig. 1A). Analysis of hind footprints confirmed that the ataxic mice could not walk in a straight line, and the length of their steps was shorter than that of the wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). Age at onset of Ngsk Prnp0/0 and Tg-MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice were 68.4  plus or minus  5.6 and 67.0  plus or minus  6.5 weeks (mean  plus or minus  S.D.), respectively. The remaining Tg/Ngsk Prnp0/0 lines have never shown any neurological symptoms up to 24 months of age, indicating that SHa, MH2M, MHM2, and MoE199K transgenes, but not MHM2.del23 to 88, were able to rescue the Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice from ataxia..

It has been demonstrated that PrPC undergoes physiological proteolytic cleavage at amino acid residues 110/111 or 111/112, leading to the production of a C-terminal fragment, C1 (23). Because the cleavage occurs within the linear 3F4 epitope, C1 is recognized by SAF-mix but not by 3F4. The 18-kDa band is thus most likely to correspond to C1. The remaining 27- and 21-kDa bands are likely to be the full-length PrP and another C-terminal minor product, C2, respectively. The brain tissues from MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice also expressed an 18-kDa band that reacted with SAF-mix but not 3F4, in addition to its full-length product of 20 kDa (lane 6 in Fig. 4, A and B)..

The present study showed that Mo.E199K PrP, as well as heterologous hamster and hamster/mouse chimeric PrPs, but not MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP, could rescue Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice from Purkinje cell death. Mo.E199K represents the E200K substitution in human PrP, which is commonly found in patients with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (21). The successful rescue by Mo.E199K strongly indicates that the mutant retains the major aspects of normal PrP function and thus argues against a dominant-negative role for the mutant. The solution structure of recombinant human PrP 90 to 231 with E200K was reported to be nearly identical to that of wild-type PrP (25). This finding also supports the notion that the amino acid substitution does not disrupt the structure critical for the normal function of PrP..

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	47	Although various hypothetical models have been proposed, precise mechanisms for the neurodegeneration seen in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice remain to be elucidated. In addition to the structural similarities between PrP and PrPLP/Dpl, the previous finding that a recombinant C-terminal PrP (121 to 231) fragment could convert into a -sheet-rich structure at acidic pH in vitro (26) prompted us to examine the involvement of abnormal PrPLP/Dpl aggregation in the neurodegeneration. However, we failed to detect detergent-insoluble PrPLP/Dpl accumulation in the central nervous system of Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice even after the onset of ataxia. PrPLP/Dpl contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds at the C-terminal portion (14), in contrast to PrP with a single disulfide bond, which has been shown to be necessary for conversion to the pathogenic isoform, PrPSc. The structures determined by intramolecular disulfide bonds may account for the difference between the two proteins in the potential for structural conversion..

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	49	It is noteworthy that the MHM2.del23 to 88 transgene, which encoded a product lacking almost the entire unique octapeptide-repeat region, failed to rescue Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice from neurodegeneration. Little difference was observed in the pathology and onset of ataxia between Ngsk Prnp0/0 and Tg-MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. The PrP expression level of Tg-MHM2.del23 to 88/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice was higher than that of Tg-SHa and Tg-MH2M/Ngsk Prnp0/0 but similar to that of Tg-MHM2/Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. This strongly indicates that the N-terminal part of PrP is essential to the rescue from Purkinje cell death. In contrast, MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP was shown to retain the potential to convert into the pathogenic isoform in prion-infected cell cultures (27) and brain tissues of Tg-MHM2.del23 to 88 mice (19). The N-terminal region could thus be a key factor for determining whether physiological function is maintained but is likely to be less important in pathogenic structural conversion..
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	50	Because the unique octapeptide-repeat region has the potential to bind copper (28), PrP may function in the transport or metabolism of copper in the neuron (29 to 31). Copper is involved in various aspects of reactive oxygen species metabolism (32). It could thus be possible that impaired copper transport may result in reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to cell death. Indeed, the reduced activity of Cu/Zn-SOD in the brains of Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice has been reported (33). However, along with other contradictory reports (34), the present study failed to show reduced activities of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and Gpx in the brains of Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. The fact that Cu/Zn-SOD-deficient mice have never developed any neurological signs such as ataxia (35) also argues against a causal relationship between reduced activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and Purkinje cell death..

The two mutant PrPs lack a part of or most of the hydrophobic region (111 to 134), in addition to the octapeptide-repeat region, which are also absent in PrPLP/Dpl. The structural similarities between PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134 and PrPLP/Dpl strongly suggested that a common mechanism is involved in the neurodegeneration in the Tg mice and Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice. Behrens and Aguzzi (36) have hypothesized an as yet unidentified ligand, which harbors affinities to both PrP and PrPLP/Dpl or the N terminus-truncated PrPs. In the absence of PrP, binding of the putative ligand to PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134 may trigger an apoptotic signal or prevent a survival signal. On the other hand, in the presence of PrP, the binding would be impeded because of much lower affinity. If this is the case, the failure of MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP in the phenotype rescue suggests that residues 23 to 88 include a site critical for ligand binding or functional transduction of ligand signals. Recent studies have demonstrated that copper binds not only to the octapeptide-repeat region but also to the C-terminal PrP-(91 to 231/121 to 231) fragments (37, 38) and PrPLP/Dpl (39). Hence, copper could be one candidate for this hypothetical ligand, acting to raise a neurotoxic signal or prevent a survival signal through binding to PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134..

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	54	We demonstrated that MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP, as well as full-length PrP, underwent proteolytic cleavage leading to the production of C1. This indicated that loss of the N-terminal residues 23 to 88 did not affect the cleavage, and C1 was not necessary for the phenotype rescue. It has also been shown that a N-terminal cleavage product, PrP-(23 to 110/111), designated N1, was released into the supernatant of cultured cells (40). An intriguing hypothesis is that N1 may play a neuroprotective role outside of the cells. For instance, it may bind to copper or other molecules to produce a neuroprotective signal. The N1 derived from MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP lacking the octapeptide-repeat region is unlikely to preserve this function. It would be of value to examine the potential of N1 to rescue Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice from the Purkinje cell death..
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	55	Another model for the neurodegeneration to be evaluated is that the absence of PrP might make cerebellar cells vulnerable to a constitutive weak apoptotic signal transduced by PrPLP/Dpl (36). PrP could raise an anti-apoptotic signal independently and protect from the PrPLP/Dpl-induced apoptosis. Accumulating evidence has supported an anti-apoptotic role of PrP. For instance, overexpression of PrP protected human primary neurons from Bax-mediated apoptosis (41). The protective effect was abolished by deletion of the octapeptide-repeat region, residues 56 to 88, of human PrP. Serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis of immortalized hippocampal cells derived from Prnp0/0 mice was also prevented by overexpressed PrP or Bcl-2 (42). Chiarini et al. (43) recently demonstrated evidence that a peptide capable of binding to residues 113 to 128 of PrP protected developing retina neurons from apoptosis via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The same group has identified stress-inducible protein 1, a heat-shock protein, which binds residues 113 to 128 of PrP and promotes a neuroprotective signal (44). Interestingly, expression of PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134 in Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice induced cerebellar neurodegeneration, but MHM2.del23 to 88 PrP preserving residues 113 to 128 did not. The absence of the potential to bind to stress-inducible protein 1 may be crucial for the neurotoxic effects of PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134 and PrPLP/Dpl..

If PrPSc mimics the neurotoxic role of PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32 to 121/32 to 134, Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice lacking PrP but ectopically expressing PrPLP/Dpl in neurons could be a valuable model for the neurodegeneration. Alternatively, it is also possible that the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in mice are distinct from those of prion diseases, based on the present finding that no detergent-insoluble PrPLP/Dpl was detectable in mouse brain tissues. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice would provide new insights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of prion diseases and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as the physiological function of PrP..

Despite a recent study describing the restriction of DPP signaling via putative ubiquitin E3 ligase dSmurf (1), the molecular mechanisms of how dSmurf affects DPP signaling remain unexplored. Toward this goal we demonstrated the degradation of phosphorylated MAD by dSmurf. dSmurf selectively interacted with MAD, but not Medea and Dad, and the MAD-dSmurf interaction was induced by constitutively active DPP type I receptor thickveins. Wild type dSmurf, but not its C1029A mutant, mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of MAD. Silencing of dSmurf using RNA interference stabilized MAD protein in Drosophila S2 cells. Targeted expression of dSmurf in various tissues abolished phosphorylated MAD and disrupted patterning and growth. In contrast, similar overexpression of inactive dSmurf(C1029A) showed no significant effects on development. We conclude that dSmurf specifically targets phosphorylated MAD to proteasome-dependent degradation and regulates DPP signaling during development..

The specificity of ubiquitination derives from the highly specific protein-protein interaction between E3 ligase and substrate (6, 7). In TGF- signaling, HECT-class E3 ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 specifically promote degradation of Smad1, Smad2 (8 to 10) and possibly I-Smads and TGF- type I receptor (11, 12). In Xenopus embryos, Smurf1 showed inhibition of BMP signaling and affected pattern formation (8). Recently, a Drosophila ligase E3 dSmurf has been identified by genetic screen (1); the null mutation of dSmurf resulted in a lethal defect in hindgut organogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying dSmurf actions in DPP signaling and embryogenesis remain unclear..

A, dSmurf binds to MAD in cells. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids for FLAG-tagged Smad (MAD, dSmad2, Medea, or Dad) and Myc-tagged dSmurf(C1029A). dSmurf complex was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, followed by a Western blot to detect dSmurf-associated MAD. Expression levels of dSmurf and Smads in whole cell lysates were shown as indicated. Asterisk indicates a nonspecific band close to the molecular mass of Medea. Note that dSmurf-MAD interaction is stronger in the presence of constitutively active TKV (compared lane 7 with lane 2).

Result in Fig. 2B clearly showed that the interaction between this mutant, named MAD(SA), and dSmurf was not detectable regardless of the presence of caTKV, whereas wild type MAD strongly interacted with dSmurf in the presence of caTKV. Furthermore, dSmurf also had stronger binding to endogenous phospho-MAD, which can be further enhanced by proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, dSmurf also interacts with dSmad2 in the presence of caActR1B (Fig. 2D), suggesting that dSmad2 phosphorylation is necessary for its binding to dSmurf (despite the absence of such interaction in yeast two-hybrid assay as shown in Fig. 1). Therefore, data presented in Fig. 2 clearly demonstrate the important involvement of SSXS phosphorylation in Smad interaction with dSmurf..

As shown in Fig. 3, wild type dSmurf was capable of enhancing ubiquitination of MAD protein (lane 3), while no ubiquitination was observed with MAD alone (lane 1). Markedly, the C1029A mutant of dSmurf could not conjugate HA-ubiquitin to MAD (lane 4). This suggests that the catalytic activity of dSmurf is required for the ubiquitination of MAD..

In S2 cells, the MAD protein level was reduced dramatically by overexpressed dSmurf (Fig. 4A). Similarly, dSmurf degraded MAD in 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B).

DPP is expressed along the anterior-posterior border of the wing disc and activated phospho-MAD is expressed in wider area around the AP border. Using UAS-Gal4 targeted expression system (20), we tested whether overexpression of dSmurf along the AP border can reduce or abolish phospho-MAD. As expected, when dSmurf expression was targeted to the AP border using ptc-Gal4, there was a strong reduction of phospho-MAD level in the ptc expression domain (Fig. 5). ptc-Gal4;UAS-dSmurf (ptc > dSmurf) flies failed to eclose due to severe developmental defects. Pharate adult flies removed from the pupal case showed rudimentary wings (Fig. 5L) and truncated legs (not shown), indicating strong reduction of DPP signaling. In contrast, overexpression of catalytically inactive dSmurf in ptc > dSmurf(C1029A) showed no significant defects in appendages. Wing discs from ptc > dSmurf(C1029A) showed slight increases in the level of phospho-MAD (Fig. 5, E to G), suggesting that dSmurfCA may titrate the function of normal dSmurf..

The preferential binding of dSmurf to pMAD is similar to a previously reported Smurf2 binding to phosphorylated Smad2 (9). Furthermore, for the first time we demonstrate that mutation in the SSXS motif of MAD abolished its binding to dSmurf, highlighting the important role of MAD phosphorylation in its degradation. This phosphorylation-dependent MAD-dSmurf interaction is contrary to a previously proposed model that Smurfs target non-phosphorylated Smad1/MAD for degradation and thus reduces the cell competence to BMP/DPP signals (1, 8). The phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, as also discussed (21), is consistent to the disappearance of pMAD in dSmurf-overexpressing transgenic flies (Fig. 5) and also agrees with the increased pMAD level in dSmurf-null mutants (1). While at present it is not clear how the phosphorylation controls the dSmurf-mediated MAD degradation, three possible mechanisms can be envisioned. First, phosphorylation of the SSXS motif disrupts the intrinsic MH1-MH2 interaction and results in an exposed PPXY motif in the linker region for dSmurf binding. Second, dSmurf interaction with MAD depends on the nuclear entry of MAD, which is induced by ligand. The third possibility is that the phosphorylated SSXS motif may be directly involved in MAD binding to dSmurf. Besides PPXY motif, phosphoserine (Ser(P)) residues also serves as ligand for WW domain (22). It will be interesting to determine whether one of WW domains of dSmurf can directly bind to the phosphorylated SSXS motif of MAD..

The binding specificity of dSmurf is similar to that of its structurally related Smurf2 which binds both BMP- and activin-activated R-Smads in vertebrates (9, 10). One remaining question is whether dSmurf also targets dSmad2 for degradation. Since activin signaling through dSmad2 appears to have no effects on patterning of wing development (23), the hypothetical dSmurf-mediated dSmad2 degradation in the wing imaginal disc should have no contributions to the severe phenotype observed in the dSmurf transgenic flies. It is the disappearance of phophos-MAD that completely shuts down DPP signaling during wing development..

TSE diseases are thought to be caused by conversion of a normal cellular glycoprotein (PrPC) into an abnormal, disease-associated isoform (PrPSc) that accumulates in diseased tissue (Prusiner, 1996). This conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is accompanied by an alteration in conformation from predominantly -helix to -sheet structure and development of partial resistance to digestion with proteinase K (PK). It has been proposed that PrPSc constitutes infectivity (Prusiner, 1982) and acts as a seed or template in the conversion of host PrPC to PrPSc (Jarrett  and  Lansbury, 1993; Prusiner, 1996; Weissmann, 1996).

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	11	The host PrP gene (Prnp) has a major influence over the outcome of TSE disease. PrP polymorphisms have been shown to alter incubation time and TSE susceptibility in mice (Moore et al., 1998), sheep (Goldmann et al., 1994) and man (Palmer et al., 1991; Goldfarb et al., 1992). Classical genetic analysis of the control of TSE incubation time in mice identified the presence of a single gene (Sinc) encoding two alleles (s7 and p7), which programmed short and long incubation times, respectively, for the ME7 strain of scrapie (Dickinson et al., 1968). Similar differences in incubation time have been found between NZW/LacJ and Iln/J mouse strains when infected with the Chandler isolate, identifying a single locus, Prni, that controlled incubation time, which was linked closely to Prnp (Carlson et al., 1986). Following isolation and characterization of the gene encoding PrP in mice (Prnp) (Basler et al., 1986; Locht et al., 1986), mouse strains carrying Sinc s7 were shown to have a Prnp gene encoding 108L_189T (Prnpa) and those carrying Sinc p7 had a Prnp gene encoding 108F_189V (Prnpb) (Westaway et al., 1987).

PrP polymorphisms have been shown to alter incubation time and TSE susceptibility in mice (Moore et al., 1998), sheep (Goldmann et al., 1994) and man (Palmer et al., 1991; Goldfarb et al., 1992). Classical genetic analysis of the control of TSE incubation time in mice identified the presence of a single gene (Sinc) encoding two alleles (s7 and p7), which programmed short and long incubation times, respectively, for the ME7 strain of scrapie (Dickinson et al., 1968). Similar differences in incubation time have been found between NZW/LacJ and Iln/J mouse strains when infected with the Chandler isolate, identifying a single locus, Prni, that controlled incubation time, which was linked closely to Prnp (Carlson et al., 1986). Following isolation and characterization of the gene encoding PrP in mice (Prnp) (Basler et al., 1986; Locht et al., 1986), mouse strains carrying Sinc s7 were shown to have a Prnp gene encoding 108L_189T (Prnpa) and those carrying Sinc p7 had a Prnp gene encoding 108F_189V (Prnpb) (Westaway et al., 1987). However, due to the different genetic backgrounds of these lines of inbred mice, it was difficult to confirm that the Prnp, Sinc and Prni genes were congruent and that the polymorphisms in Prnp were responsible for the control of scrapie incubation time in mice..

Wild-type PrP clones were derived from a 129/Ola HM-1 ES cell genomic library and amino acids were modified by site-directed mutagenesis. Targeting vectors were constructed by the introduction of a PGK/HPRT cassette (flanked by LoxP sites) and an HSV/TK cassette for selection purposes. After homologous recombination in ES cells, the PGK/HPRT cassette was removed with Cre recombinase. Primer pair W262 and W6991 was used to determine successful homologous recombination in targeted ES cells. Primer pair W7878 and W6991 was used to screen for the Cre-mediated deletion of the PGK-HPRT cassette (see Methods). In the presence of the cassette, the PCR fragment is too large to amplify. A successfully removed cassette produces a PCR product larger than the wild-type allele, due to the retention of a single LoxP site and part of the pBluescript multiple-cloning site after Cre recombination. Presence of 108F or 189V polymorphism was confirmed by PCR of the ORF using primers A996 and B188 and digestion of the product with MnlI (108F) or BstEII (189V).

These targeting events produced ES cell clones expressing Prnpa[108F_189T] (PrnpFT) or Prnpa[108L_189V] (PrnpLV). Presence of the targeted mutations was verified by the loss of an MnlI restriction site at codon 108 (CTC to TTC alteration) and the loss of a BstEII restriction site at codon 189 (ACC to GTC alteration) (Fig. 1). Southern blot analysis using probes derived from the intron/exon 2 region, from intron 2 and from exon 3 confirmed that no further alterations had occurred in the mouse genome during targeting (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis was carried out to ensure that the PrnpFT and PrnpLV alleles had undergone no detectable deletions, insertions or other rearrangements during the targeting process. However, the gene-targeting strategy resulted in the retention of a 38 bp LoxP site and a small portion of the pBluescript multiple-cloning site (100 bp) 2 kb downstream of exon 3 of the Prnp gene (Fig. 1). The LoxP site was distant from the intergenic exons between Prnp and the closely located Prnd (doppel) and was thus not expected to influence the expression of either gene..

Northern blot (Fig. 2) and Western blot (Fig. 3) analysis of tissues from each line confirmed expression from the PrnpFT and PrnpLV alleles and indicated that the levels of expression in the three homozygous lines (FV/FV, LV/LV and FT/FT) were indistinguishable from those of wild-type 129/Ola mice. Prnp gene expression was therefore not affected by the process of gene targeting, the introduction of a single polymorphism or the presence of the LoxP site 3' of the Prnp gene. Thus, any alteration in incubation time and neuropathology observed on inoculation of these animals with TSE infectivity should be attributable to the specific alterations at codons 108 and 189, and not due to any differences in Prnp gene-expression levels..

Following ME7 challenge, LT/FV mice had incubation times of 223 days, intermediate between those of the parental lines LT/LT (155 days) and the gene-targeted FV/FV (295 days). This pattern of allelic interaction recapitulates that observed between wild-type Prnpa, Prnpb and F1 crosses and demonstrates that the gene-targeted FV allele can reproduce the dominance pattern observed in mice with wild-type PrP alleles. Incubation times of 168 and 261 days were obtained in FT/FT and LV/LV lines of mice, respectively (Table 1), which were distinct from those in wild-type LT/LT and gene-targeted FV/FV mice, indicating that neither 108F nor 189T is solely responsible for the increased incubation time in FV/FV mice. The most significant change in incubation time was due to the T to V alteration at codon 189, producing a difference of 100 days between LT/LT and LV/LV lines. A much smaller difference of 13 days was produced by the L to F polymorphism at codon 108 (FT/FT), demonstrating that both codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms can alter murine scrapie incubation times independently..

The most significant change in incubation time was due to the T to V alteration at codon 189, producing a difference of 100 days between LT/LT and LV/LV lines. A much smaller difference of 13 days was produced by the L to F polymorphism at codon 108 (FT/FT), demonstrating that both codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms can alter murine scrapie incubation times independently..

There is no obvious pattern of allelic combination associated with increasing incubation time (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online), with the exception that the two shortest incubation times are in mice that are homozygous for 189T (155 and 168 days) and the two longest are in mice that are homozygous for 189V (295 and 325 days), in keeping with identity at codon 189 with the source of the agent (LT/LT). However, homozygosity at codon 189 does not always produce extreme incubation times, as LT/FT and LV/LV mice have intermediate incubation times of 196 and 261 days, respectively (Table 1)..

When lines are sorted into groups by codon 189 genotype (189TT, 189VV or 189FV), the effect of codon 108 on incubation time is the same in each of the three groups: the shortest incubation times occur when the codon at 108 is homozygous for either L or F, although the shorter of the two is always 108LL, matching that of the source of the inoculum (LT/LT). Therefore, at codon 108, heterozygosity always leads to increased incubation times with respect to the combination at codon 189, despite the inoculum matching one allele at codon 108. Indeed, incubation times in excess of those in Prnpb (FV/FV) mice were observed in FV/LV mice [Table 1 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)]. However, when sorted by codon 108 genotype (108LL, 108FF or 108LF), a different pattern of incubation time is observed. For each of the three groups, homozygosity for threonine at codon 189 (which matches the source of the inoculum) gives the shortest incubation times and homozygosity for valine (which does not match the inoculum) gives the longest incubation times, whilst the heterozygotes (TV) produce intermediate incubation times. Hence, at codon 108, ME7 incubation times follow the pattern LL < FF < LF, whilst at codon 189, the pattern of incubation time is TT < TV < VV. These results show that the effect on incubation period depends upon the combination of PrP alleles, particularly the presence of homozygosity or heterozygosity at codons 108 and 189 and on identity with the source of the inoculum at these positions in PrP..

Similarly, FV/FV mice that have long ME7 incubation periods produce short incubation periods of 125 days with 301V. The role of codons 108 and 189 in the control of 301V incubation time was explored by challenge of FT/FT and LV/LV mice. Incubation times of 141 and 202 days were obtained in the LV/LV and FT/FT lines of mice, respectively, compared to 125 days in FV/FV mice and 240 days in LT/LT mice (Table 1). Hence, in agreement with the data obtained from inoculations with ME7, both codons 108 and 189 are responsible for the control of incubation time for the 301V agent strain. Similarly to ME7, the greatest effect was produced by the T to V alteration at codon 189 (100 days reduction). However the L to F change produced a greater effect on incubation time with 301V (60 days reduction) than with ME7, again showing that challenge with an agent that shows identity at codon 108 or 189 results in the shortest incubation times (Table 1). The full range of allelic combinations has not been examined with this strain of TSE agent. In addition, no incubation time is available for the LT/FT line. Six LT/FT mice were culled due to welfare reasons between 327 and 377 days and all showed positive TSE pathology on examination of the brain tissue, suggesting an incubation time in excess of that of the LT/LT line (240 days). However, the combinations that were examined have produced patterns of incubation-time alteration identical to those identified with ME7 [Table 1 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)], with the exception that the F1 cross LT/FV has an incubation time in excess of those of both parental lines. This overdominance is characteristic of 301V and can be observed with other TSE strains. Thus, the pattern of incubation time for 301V appears to be FF < LL < LF at codon 108 and VV < TV < TT at codon 189. This pattern is the same as that observed for ME7, where heterozygosity results in extended incubation times for 108LF, but intermediate incubation times with 189TV. The shortest incubation times for both strains of agent reveal a preference for identity with the genotype of the donor of infectivity (LT/LT for ME7 and FV/FV for 301V)..

Thus, the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in host PrP do not influence the distribution of vacuolar pathology with the ME7 strain of scrapie. However, the polymorphisms appeared to affect the degree of vacuolation. In general, lines containing 189TT (LT/LT, FT/FT and LT/FT) or 189TV with homozygosity at 108 (LT/LV and FT/FV) had short incubation times ( < 215 days) and gave very similar vacuolation profiles. Lines displaying higher vacuolation scores had longer incubation times and contained 189VV (FV/FV, LV/LV or FV/LV) or were heterozygous at both 108 and 189 (LV/FT). However, the LT/FV heterozygote gave a vacuolation profile more similar to that in LT/LT mice (Fig. 5c). Alternatively, these observations may simply reflect incubation time of disease, with high degrees of vacuolation being associated with extended incubation times..

The LT/FV heterozygote produced an intermediate vacuolation profile (Fig. 5f). The degree of vacuolation with 301V therefore does appear to be controlled by the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms and not by incubation time, as extended incubation times in FT/FT and LT/FT mice resulted in lower vacuolation scores in areas 7 to 9 compared to FV/FV mice (Fig. 5d to e)..
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	55	   DISCUSSION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Previous experiments have shown that the introduction of 108F_189V into the murine Prnpa gene had a major effect on TSE disease, producing incubation times similar to those in Prnpb mice for both Sinc s7-derived (ME7, 139A, 79A and 301C) and Sinc p7-derived (301V and 22A) strains (Moore et al., 1998; Barron et al., 2003; Barron  and  Manson, 2004). These results showed that amino acids 108 and 189 in murine PrP exert the major control over scrapie incubation time in Prnpa and Prnpb lines of mice, but could not determine whether either or both of the polymorphisms were responsible for this control. By targeting each polymorphism separately into the murine Prnpa gene, we have been able to analyse the specific effects of codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in co-isogenic mice, both independently and in several different allelic combinations. Inoculation of these lines with two scrapie strains has shown that both codons 108 and 189 in murine PrP are responsible for control of scrapie incubation time in mice, as incubation times in LV/LV and FT/FT mice are distinct from those produced in LT/LT and FV/FV mice. The shortest incubation times were obtained when PrP expressed from both alleles matched the PrP in the inoculum (LT/LT for ME7 and FV/FV for 301V). Correspondingly, long incubation times were obtained for LT/LT mice with 301V and FV/FV mice with ME7. However, from analysis of the other allelic combinations, it was apparent that shortened incubation times were also obtained in lines where codon 189 matched the source of the inoculum and the residues on both alleles at codon 108 were homogeneous. Of these, the shortest incubation times occurred when these residues at codon 108 matched the source of inoculum. In lines heterozygous at both codons 108 and 189 (with LT and FV molecules in one case, and LV and FT molecules expressed in the other), shorter incubation times were observed in the line expressing PrP that matched the source of inoculum (LT/LT for ME7). The importance of homozygosity at codon 108 and identity with the inoculum at codon 189 suggests that these areas of the protein play very different roles in the disease process..
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	56	The control of incubation time is thought to be due to PrP sequence identity between the host and the donor of infectivity. However, our results show that short incubation times are obtained in FT/FT mice inoculated with LT/LT-derived ME7 and in LV/LV mice inoculated with FV/FV-derived 301V, despite the sequence incompatibility between donor and host at codon 108. Hence, although codon 108 polymorphisms can affect scrapie incubation time independently, the major control is due to identity with the source of inoculum at codon 189. The inoculation of mice expressing different combinations of PrnpLT, PrnpFV, PrnpLV and PrnpFT produced a complex series of incubation times (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online). It was clear that, in addition to identity with the inoculum at codon 189, homozygosity at codon 108 consistently gave rise to shorter incubation times in both 108L/L- and 108F/F-expressing lines. Heterozygosity at codon 108 always resulted in extended incubation times with respect to the genotype at codon 189. Although the series of allelic crosses produced for these experiments are described as homozygous and heterozygous at codons 108 and 189, expression from both Prnp alleles in a heterozygote will result in the presence of two different PrP populations in the cell. It is interactions between these proteins, and not between Prnp alleles, that will determine the incubation time of disease. Hence, the nature or combination of PrP variants in the recipient may be more important than PrP identity with the inoculum, indicating that interactions between amino acids 108 and 189, either on the same or different proteins, is a critical part of disease propagation..

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	58	It has been proposed that the production of PrPSc is a two-step process that involves binding of PrP-res (PK-resistant PrP) to PrP-sen (PK-sensitive PrP), followed by the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res (Caughey, 2001). However, it is unknown which process requires PrP amino acid identity. Cell-free conversion experiments have shown that mouse PrP-res (108L_111V) will convert mouse PrP-sen expressing the 3F4 epitope (108M_111M), but not hamster PrP-sen (also possessing the 3F4 epitope), even though both proteins were found to bind to mouse PrP-res (Horiuchi et al., 2000). Deletion mutants lacking residues 34 to 113 (MoPrP34 to 113) also bound to mouse PrP-res and converted, albeit with reduced efficiency (Lawson et al., 2001). These results imply that amino acid 108 is not required for either initiation of conversion or binding to PrPSc, but may be involved in the control of the rate of conversion and final conformation of PrP-res (Lawson et al., 2004). Moreover, MoPrP34 to 113 was found to bind heterologous PrPSc, but, unlike the full-length molecule, did not prevent the conversion of homologous PrPC, again suggesting that this region is involved in the control of conversion, but not binding (Lawson et al., 2001). The 34 to 113 truncation of PrPC was also found to affect the solubility of the molecule, as loss of these residues reduced the percentage of PrP-sen that was seen to self-aggregate when incubated under cell-free assay conditions in the absence of PrP-res. This region may therefore be responsible for some degree of multimerization/aggregation of PrP-sen, which may be beneficial for conversion (Lawson et al., 2001)..

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	60	The individual effects of codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in PrP have also been modelled in vitro by expressing recombinant 108F_189T and 108L_189V PrP in Escherichia coli (Brown et al., 2000). These intermediate forms of PrP were found to be less stable than both PrP-A (108L_189T) and PrP-B (108F_189V) and were observed to lose their normal conformation and gain some PK resistance over time. It was proposed that inheritance of either 108F or 189V alone may be a disadvantage in terms of mouse survival, and that mice expressing either of these polymorphisms separately could potentially develop spontaneous disease (Brown et al., 2000). However, the recently reported existence of a Prnpc (108F_189T)-expressing line (Lloyd et al., 2004) and the data presented here for transgenic FT/FT and LV/LV lines show that such mice are viable and do not develop any neurological phenotype during their lifespan. PrP expressed in the brains of transgenic LT/LT and FV/FV mice is PK-sensitive and expressed at levels identical to those in wild-type mice of both genotypes. These results demonstrate clearly that in vitro and in vivo studies can produce very different outcomes; these may be due to the difference in PrP post-translational modification and/or the physiological environment of the native protein..
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	61	From the data presented here, we predict that: (i) polymorphisms at PrP codon 189 control the initial interaction and binding with the agent, as incubation times reflect a preference for sequence identity between the host and inoculum at codon 189; and (ii) polymorphisms at codon 108 control the rate of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, where the ability to induce multimerization of PrPC and increase the efficiency of conversion is favoured when all PrP expressed in a cell is homogeneous in the N-terminal region. Alternatively, the preference for codon 108 homozygosity may reflect a more complex interaction between host PrPC and PrPSc that is less efficient in the presence of heterogeneous protein populations. However, the importance of codon 108 homozygosity in murine scrapie transmission may explain the role of PrP codon 129 in human TSE disease, where the majority of CJD cases occur in individuals who are homozygous for methionine or valine at codon 129 (Palmer et al., 1991; Zeidler et al., 1997; Alperovitch et al., 1999). There is an under-representation of M/V heterozygotes with CJD when compared to the distribution of genotypes in the normal population (Palmer et al., 1991), suggesting that a similar mechanism requiring N-terminal homogeneity controls the efficiency of disease transmission in humans..
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	62	From the data presented here, we predict that: (i) polymorphisms at PrP codon 189 control the initial interaction and binding with the agent, as incubation times reflect a preference for sequence identity between the host and inoculum at codon 189; and (ii) polymorphisms at codon 108 control the rate of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, where the ability to induce multimerization of PrPC and increase the efficiency of conversion is favoured when all PrP expressed in a cell is homogeneous in the N-terminal region. Alternatively, the preference for codon 108 homozygosity may reflect a more complex interaction between host PrPC and PrPSc that is less efficient in the presence of heterogeneous protein populations. However, the importance of codon 108 homozygosity in murine scrapie transmission may explain the role of PrP codon 129 in human TSE disease, where the majority of CJD cases occur in individuals who are homozygous for methionine or valine at codon 129 (Palmer et al., 1991; Zeidler et al., 1997; Alperovitch et al., 1999).

Several other studies have suggested the involvement of PrP dimers in disease (Priola et al., 1995; Warwicker, 1997, 2000; Meyer et al., 2000; Jansen et al., 2001; Meier et al., 2003), yet most existing dimer models do not consider dimerization of the N-terminal region of PrP, due to the lack of structural information available for this region. Combined with the in vivo data produced in this study, the observations that amino acids 90 to 121 are retained after PK cleavage of PrPSc and that deletion of this region affects susceptibility to disease (Fischer et al., 1996; Shmerling et al., 1998; Flechsig et al., 2000; Lawson et al., 2001; Supattapone et al., 2001) prove that this is a structurally important part of the molecule that is involved in the control of disease incubation time..

0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Introduction Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also named `prion diseases', are fatal neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (Prusiner et al., 1996; Caughey and Chesebro, 1997). In affected humans and animals, TSEs are characterized by the accumulation in the central nervous system of a protease-resistant isoform (PrP-res or PrPsc) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP-sen or PrPc). As no differences in their primary sequences could be demonstrated, PrP-sen and PrP-res isoforms are believed to differ only in their tertiary structure (Stahl et al., 1993). Macromolecular aggregates of PrP-res are thought to continuously grow by binding PrP-sen molecules and converting them into their own conformation. Conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res is the pivotal event in the etiology of TSEs, even though the mechanisms initiating the conversion reaction remain unknown. Both PrP isoforms, PrP-sen and PrP-res, are believed to be involved in the neuropathogenesis of TSEs (Bueler et al., 1993; Brandner et al., 1996). Homozygous disruption of the Prnp gene encoding PrP results in a complete scrapie resistance in these mice (Bueler et al., 1993). Moreover, the expression level of PrP-sen is a major factor influencing the rate of replication of the infectious agent as well as the incubation time of the TSEs (Sakaguchi et al., 1995; Carlson et al., 1994). The importance of PrP-sen in TSEs is also exemplified by genetic linkages between familial TSEs and mutations in the human Prnp gene (Parchi and Gambetti, 1995)..

Since PrP-sen expression is essential for both TSE pathogenesis and conversion leading to PrP-res accumulation, we studied the effect of specific Prnp gene silencing molecules in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (N2aS12sc+). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) provide new powerful tools to potentially silence any targeted gene (Elbashir et al., 2001). Because siRNA duplexes trigger specific gene silencing in mammalian somatic cells without the activation of any unspecific response, the analysis of gene function in cultured cells has now become possible. Here, we show that transient transfection of siRNA duplexes designed from the mouse Prnp gene (moPrnp) causes a rapid loss of PrP-sen expression and abrogates PrP-res formation in N2aS12sc+ cells. By contrast, the scrambled siRNA failed to inhibit both the PrP-sen expression and PrP-res accumulation in these cells suggesting a highly specific siRNA effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the siRNA gene silencing is independent of both the host cell types and mouse-adapted scrapie strain..

These observations led us to study the effect of silencing the Prnp gene using siRNAs. We speculated that abrogation of PrP-sen expression may subsequently downregulate, or abolish PrP-res accumulation in scrapie-infected N2aS12sc+ cells. These cells were transfected with various concentrations of moPrnp gene-specific siRNA and then assayed for PrP immunoreactivity in the absence (Fig. 1A) or in the presence (Fig. 1B) of PK-digestion. The expression of PrP-sen was specifically reduced by the cognate siRNA duplex in a dose-dependent manner, whereas expression of the unrelated protein ERK was unaffected (Fig. 1A). Importantly, this treatment also reduced PrP-res levels (Fig. 1B). The concentrations of Prnp-specific siRNA able to inhibit 50% of the PrP-sen expression and of the PrP-res accumulation were IC50 72 and 100 nM, respectively (Fig. 1C). Scrambled siRNA unrelated to any known genes, was unable to perturb the amount of PrP-sen and PrP-res in N2aS12sc+ cells even at high concentrations (400 nM). Single-stranded siRNAs transfected independently in N2aS12sc+ cells were also unable to diminish the expression of PrP-sen (data not shown)..

These observations led us to study the effect of silencing the Prnp gene using siRNAs. We speculated that abrogation of PrP-sen expression may subsequently downregulate, or abolish PrP-res accumulation in scrapie-infected N2aS12sc+ cells. These cells were transfected with various concentrations of moPrnp gene-specific siRNA and then assayed for PrP immunoreactivity in the absence (Fig. 1A) or in the presence (Fig. 1B) of PK-digestion. The expression of PrP-sen was specifically reduced by the cognate siRNA duplex in a dose-dependent manner, whereas expression of the unrelated protein ERK was unaffected (Fig. 1A).

(A) Immunoblot of a representative experiment performed with transfected N2aS12sc+ cells in the absence (0) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of Prnp gene-specific siRNA or of scrambled siRNA duplexes. One-tenth of the post-nuclear cell lysates were directly mixed with the same volume of 2x denaturing loading buffer. PrP-sen was first detected with the SAF83 mouse monoclonal antibody. The same blot was then incubated in the presence of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against ERK proteins (40-42 kDa) as a control of protein loading. (B) 90% of the lysates of untransfected or siRNAs-transfected N2aS12sc+ cells were PK-digested as described under Materials and Methods and loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Partially PK-digested PrP-res was assayed with SAF83 monoclonal antibody. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left in kilodaltons (kDa).

The detectable amounts of PrP-res were also drastically reduced in this cell line after transfection with Prnp gene-specific siRNA duplexes (Fig. 2) and IC50 values were comparable with those obtained using N2aS12sc+ cells (IC50 106 nM). This suggests that neither host cell types nor mouse scrapie strains influence the gene-silencing effect of the siRNA. During the time course of these experiments (4 days), no cytotoxic effect of siRNAs was observed..

The percentage of fluorescein-labeled neuroblastoma cells (green) reached 82% plus or minus 6% as early as 48 hours post-transfection and was stable over 72 hours (Fig. 3A). No green fluorescence was detected in cells transfected with the fluorescein-labeled single-stranded RNA as shown in the control experiment (Fig. 3A). We also used confocal imaging to investigate the sub-cellular localization of the fluorescein-labeled siRNA duplexes. Transfected cells exhibited a punctate fluorescence pattern largely localised to the perinuclear cytoplasmic region (Fig. 3B). No labeling was observed at the cell surface or inside the nucleus. Based on both the transfection efficiency and the assessment of PrP expression, we found that OligofectamineTM was the most efficient transfection reagent for siRNA duplexes..

Samples were assayed by Western blot analysis for the presence of PrP isoforms in the presence or in the absence of PK-digestion (Fig. 4). PrP-sen was barely detectable in transfected cells before passaging but levels increased with the number of passages, reaching the level observed with untreated-cells after four passages. A single siRNA transfection led to a complete disappearance of PrP-res immunoreactivity after two passages of N2aS12sc+ cells. However, after four passages, low levels of the PK-resistant PrP isoform were observed in N2aS12sc+ cells. Our data suggest that a single exposure of N2aS12sc+ cells to siRNA was not sufficient to completely remove the pathogenic isoform and permanently suppress scrapie infection..

In neuroblastoma cells, PrP-mRNAs have a half-life of approximately 7 hours (Pfeifer et al., 1993) and PrP-sen is synthesized and degraded relatively rapidly (tg 5 hours). Whereas, PrP-res aggregates which derived from PrP-sen, is produced slowly (tg 15 hours) (Borchelt et al., 1990). Several mechanisms may lead to PrP-res depletion including interference with the PrP-sen/PrP-res interaction (Caspi et al., 1998; Chabry et al., 1998; Horiuchi et al., 2001) and reversion of PrP-res to a PK-sensitive state (Soto et al., 2000). In addition, prevention of PrP-sen endocytosis from the cell surface to endosomes and/or release of PrP-sen from the plasma membrane could prevent PrP-res accumulation (Enari et al., 2001; Marella et al., 2002). Expression of PrP-sen is essential but not sufficient for prion propagation and pathogenesis (Raeber et al., 1999). It has been suggested earlier that suppression of PrP expression might be a potential therapeutic approach against prion diseases (Bueler et al., 1993)..

0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	34	The factors responsible for the rate and the strength of siRNA-induced gene suppression are currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that siRNA designed from the moPrnp gene was highly specific to cells expressing the PrP mouse sequence. The siRNA effect was independent of both the scrapie strains and the host cell type. Furthermore, no difference in siRNA efficiency was observed between moPrP overexpressing cells (N2aS12 subclone) and N2a cells expressing only endogenous PrP (data not shown). The finding that exposure of chronically infected neuroblastoma cells to siRNA results in undetectable amounts of PrP-res after 3-4 days, suggests that these cells express proteases that degrade PrP-res aggregates. Recently, Enari et al. have proposed that the cellular level of PrP-res is determined by the rate of its formation from the substrate, PrP-sen, and its catabolism (Enari et al., 2001). The removal of PrP-sen could displace the equilibrium to the degradation processes. An obvious limitation is that although PrP-res levels were dramatically decreased by acute siRNA exposure, the cells were not definitively `cured' of scrapie infection; thus, chronic treatments or longer exposures of siRNA may be considered in the future. We are currently performing experiments to improve the long-term effects of siRNA duplexes..

Although efficient and powerful brain delivery systems remain to be found, it appears likely that siRNA technology could constitute a new promising strategy for therapy against TSEs. Current drug treatments delay, but do not prevent, the appearance of clinical symptoms and death in experimental scrapie-infected animals (Demaimay et al., 1997; Priola et al., 2000). The in vivo use of siRNA alone, or in combination with these drugs, should be considered to improve the life span and cure sick animals. The recent development of siRNA technology offers a powerful tool to ablate specific gene expression in a wide range of mammalian cells including neurons..

Incubation times in 101LL mice were extended with all four strains of agent when compared with those in the corresponding mouse genotype from which the infectivity was derived. However, the degree to which the incubation period was increased showed considerable variation between each strain of agent. Moreover, the presence of this single amino acid alteration resulted in a 70 day reduction in incubation time of the 301V strain in Prnpa mice. The effect of the 101L mutation on murine scrapie incubation time appears therefore to be strain specific..

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases which include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt to Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. These diseases are thought to be caused by the conversion of a normal cellular glycoprotein (PrPC) into an abnormal disease associated form, PrPSc (Prusiner, 1996). As their name indicates, TSE diseases are transmissible, and many different TSE agents have been transmitted to and maintained in laboratory mice (Bruce, 1993; Bruce et al., 1991, 2002). Mouse-passaged TSE strains can be readily studied in the laboratory, and the identical genetic background of inbred strains of laboratory mice allows the direct comparison of different TSE agents in each individual strain of mouse (Bruce et al., 1991). The murine Prnp gene which encodes the PrP protein, appears to be the major but not the only factor controlling the incubation time of TSE disease in mice (Carlson et al., 1988, 1994; Lloyd et al., 2001; Manolakou et al., 2001; Stephenson et al., 2000). Mice that lack PrP protein (PrP null mice) do not develop disease when inoculated with TSE infectivity (Bueler et al., 1993; Manson et al., 1994a). Transgenic mice containing multiple copies of the Prnp gene which express elevated levels of PrP protein, show reduced incubation times with TSE infectivity when compared with wild-type mice (Scott et al., 1989; Westaway et al., 1991, 1994). This gene dosage effect is also evident in transgenic mice containing only one copy of the PrP gene, which express reduced levels of PrP protein and show prolonged TSE incubation times (Manson et al., 1994b). Different lines of inbred mice can show altered incubation times with the same TSE agent, and this has been linked to two naturally occurring polymorphisms found in the mouse PrP protein at amino acids 108 and 189 (Westaway et al., 1987). Mice encoding 108L/189T in PrP (such as C57BL and 129/Ola) contain the murine Prnpa gene, while mice encoding 108F/189V (such as VM) contain the murine Prnpb gene. In general, strains passaged in Prnpa mice maintain shortened incubation times in Prnpa mice, but show prolonged incubation times in Prnpb mice, and vice versa. However, some strains passaged in Prnpb mice (e.g. 79V) do show shorter incubation times in Prnpa mice (Bruce, 1993). The different genetic backgrounds of the various inbred lines of mice complicated studies of the effects of these polymorphisms. However, introduction of the 108F/189V polymorphisms into the Prnpa allele of murine PrP by gene targeting (Prnpa(108F/189V)) has established that it is indeed the 108/189 polymorphisms which exert the major control over scrapie incubation time in wild-type mice (Moore et al., 1998)..
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	8	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases which include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt to Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. These diseases are thought to be caused by the conversion of a normal cellular glycoprotein (PrPC) into an abnormal disease associated form, PrPSc (Prusiner, 1996). As their name indicates, TSE diseases are transmissible, and many different TSE agents have been transmitted to and maintained in laboratory mice (Bruce, 1993; Bruce et al., 1991, 2002). Mouse-passaged TSE strains can be readily studied in the laboratory, and the identical genetic background of inbred strains of laboratory mice allows the direct comparison of different TSE agents in each individual strain of mouse (Bruce et al., 1991). The murine Prnp gene which encodes the PrP protein, appears to be the major but not the only factor controlling the incubation time of TSE disease in mice (Carlson et al., 1988, 1994; Lloyd et al., 2001; Manolakou et al., 2001; Stephenson et al., 2000). Mice that lack PrP protein (PrP null mice) do not develop disease when inoculated with TSE infectivity (Bueler et al., 1993; Manson et al., 1994a). Transgenic mice containing multiple copies of the Prnp gene which express elevated levels of PrP protein, show reduced incubation times with TSE infectivity when compared with wild-type mice (Scott et al., 1989; Westaway et al., 1991, 1994). This gene dosage effect is also evident in transgenic mice containing only one copy of the PrP gene, which express reduced levels of PrP protein and show prolonged TSE incubation times (Manson et al., 1994b). Different lines of inbred mice can show altered incubation times with the same TSE agent, and this has been linked to two naturally occurring polymorphisms found in the mouse PrP protein at amino acids 108 and 189 (Westaway et al., 1987). Mice encoding 108L/189T in PrP (such as C57BL and 129/Ola) contain the murine Prnpa gene, while mice encoding 108F/189V (such as VM) contain the murine Prnpb gene. In general, strains passaged in Prnpa mice maintain shortened incubation times in Prnpa mice, but show prolonged incubation times in Prnpb mice, and vice versa. However, some strains passaged in Prnpb mice (e.g. 79V) do show shorter incubation times in Prnpa mice (Bruce, 1993). The different genetic backgrounds of the various inbred lines of mice complicated studies of the effects of these polymorphisms. However, introduction of the 108F/189V polymorphisms into the Prnpa allele of murine PrP by gene targeting (Prnpa(108F/189V)) has established that it is indeed the 108/189 polymorphisms which exert the major control over scrapie incubation time in wild-type mice (Moore et al., 1998)..
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	9	The influence of other amino acid substitutions in the murine Prnp gene on the incubation time of disease has been demonstrated previously. The substitution of leucine for proline at amino acid 101 (101L) in the murine Prnpa allele by gene targeting (Prnpa101L) has been shown to shorten TSE incubation times with P102L GSS from humans, 263K from hamsters and SSBP/1 from sheep when compared with wild-type (101P) mice. Conversely, a second human TSE agent, variant CJD (vCJD), displayed prolonged incubation times in Prnpa101L (101LL) mice when compared with wild-type mice (Barron et al., 2001; Manson et al., 1999). Furthermore, when challenged with the mouse-passaged scrapie strains ME7 (derived from mice carrying the Prnpa gene) and 22A (derived from mice carrying the Prnpb gene), the 101LL mice also displayed increased incubation times when compared with mice homozygous for either Prnpa or Prnpb alleles (Barron et al., 2001; Manson et al., 1999). Transgenic mice overexpressing murine PrP containing a methionine substitution at position 108 have also been shown to produce a lengthening in scrapie incubation time compared with mice overexpressing the wild-type gene; however, the effect of mutation and transgene copy number cannot readily be separated in these experiments (Supattapone et al., 2001)..

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	11	The mechanism by which these polymorphisms and mutations in murine PrP control incubation time has not yet been established. Amino acids 101 and 108 are located in the N-terminal region of PrP (amino acids 21 to 121), which has been described in NMR structural studies as having no discernible secondary structure (Donne et al., 1997; Hornemann et al., 1997; Zahn et al., 2000). However, despite the apparent lack of structure, this region of PrP contains the octapeptide repeat sequences which have been shown to bind copper, and therefore may influence both the structure and the function of the normal protein (Brown et al., 1997; Brown  and  Harris, 2002). Deletion studies have shown also that removing sections of the N-terminal region can cause increased incubation times and reduced efficiency of disease propagation in mice (Flechsig et al., 2000; Supattapone et al., 2001), and can reduce efficiency of PrPC conversion in cell-free conversion assays (Lawson et al., 2001). Due to the close proximity of amino acids 101 and 108, it is possible that similar mechanisms are operating by which changes at these positions in murine PrP control scrapie incubation time in mice. In order to further investigate the role of this region of PrP in influencing TSE disease transmission, we have inoculated 101LL mice with four mouse-passaged TSE strains derived from both Prnpa and Prnpb mice, and compared the disease profile of 101LL mice with that of Prnpa and Prnpb mice of the same genetic background..

For detection of PrPSc in transgenic and wild-type mice, 10 % (w/v) homogenates of frozen brain tissue were prepared in NP40 buffer [0 5 % (v/v) NP40, 0 5 % (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7 5]. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4  degrees C to remove cellular debris. Clarified supernates (100 mg wet weight ml-1) were incubated with or without Proteinase K at 20  microg ml-1 for 1 h at 37  degrees C, and the reaction terminated by addition of PMSF. Samples were mixed with 2x sample buffer (Novex, Invitrogen) at 10 mg ml-1 final concentration and incubated at 90  degrees C for 20 min. Total protein estimates were not performed, as the effect of the mutation on PrPSc levels was unknown. Samples were therefore loaded as wet weight tissue equivalents. Twenty  microl of each sample (approximately 200  microg wet weight tissue) was separated on 12 % Novex Tris/glycine acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane by electroblotting, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mAbs 8H4 or 7A12 (Zanusso et al., 1998) at 50 ng  microl-1 concentration. Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Diagnostics).

TSE strains 139A and 79A were both derived from mice homozygous for Prnpa, whereas 79V and 301V were derived from mice homozygous for Prnpb. The incubation times obtained for each transmission are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The analysis of these results was complex due to transmission of TSE strains derived from both Prnpa and Prnpb mice. Incubation times produced by Prnpa-derived strains in 101LL mice could be directly compared with the homologous transmission in Prnpa mice, as the 101L mutation was introduced into the Prnpa gene by gene targeting. This comparison would reveal the specific effect of the 101L mutation on TSE disease progression. In addition, comparison of 101LL mice with Prnpa(108F/189V) mice (which also contain the mutations in the Prnpa gene) would demonstrate whether the 101L and the 108F/189V mutations influenced incubation time in a similar manner. However with Prnpb-derived strains, the effects seen in 101LL mice were most likely due to the combined presence of 108L/189T and 101L. The interpretation of the Prnpb strain data therefore depends on whether the 101LL incubation times are compared with the homologous strain transmission to Prnpb mice, or the heterologous strain transmission to Prnpa mice. Comparison of 101LL mice with Prnpb mice shows the effect of three amino acid changes in host PrP (108, 189 and 101) on transmission of homologous strains of agent, whereas comparison with Prnpa mice examines the precise effect of the 101L mutation on the transmission of non-homologous strains of agent.

The results showed that 79A and 139A incubation times were increased in both 101LL and Prnpa(108F/189V) mice when compared with Prnpa mice (Table 1, Fig. 1). However, the degree to which incubation times were extended varied with the strain of agent. With the 79A strain of agent the 108F/189V alterations lead to a more prolonged incubation time than the 101L mutation, whereas the opposite was true for the 139A strain.

Incubation times of 79V are reduced in Prnpa mice (234 days) compared with the expected homologous transmission in VM (Prnpb) mice of 270 days (Bruce, 1993) (data not available from transmission of 79V to Prnpa(108F/189V) mice). However, the incubation time in 101LL mice was found to be extended by over 100 days with respect to both Prnpa and Prnpb genotypes (377 days). With 301V, incubation times in both Prnpa and 101LL mice were extended with respect to Prnpa(108F/189V) mice, but the degree to which the incubation times were increased was greater in Prnpa than in 101LL mice (70 day difference). These results also differed from those obtained previously with 22A (also Prnpb derived) in which incubation times of Prnpa and 101LL mice were increased by approximately the same degree compared with Prnpa(108F/189V) mice (Table 1, Fig. 1). However, in transmissions of Prnpb strains of agent to 101LL mice, the observed effects are due to three amino acid changes in host PrP (108, 189 and 101). To truly examine the effect of the 101L mutation on Prnpb-derived strains of agent would require the mutation to be expressed on this allele, as the possibility of combinatory or compensatory mechanisms of the 101L and 108L alterations cannot be ignored during infection with Prnpb strains (Vorberg et al., 2003). However, the effect of Prnpb strains in Prnpa and 101LL mice (which differ by only one amino acid) was unpredictable.

To determine whether the 101L mutation in the host PrP gene influenced the level of protease-resistant PrP produced by other strains of mouse scrapie, brain homogenates were prepared from 101LL and wild-type Prnpa mice infected with the Prnpa strains 139A and 79A, and the Prnpb strains 22A, 79V and 301V, and analysed by Western blotting with mAbs 7A12 and 8H4. Preliminary analysis focused on three mice of each genotype with each strain of agent, to assess whether levels of PrPSc in the brain were consistent, or varied between animals. For all transmissions, similar levels of PrPSc were observed between three mice in each group, except for the transmission of 22A to 101LL mice (data not shown). Comparison of 101LL and Prnpa mice inoculated with Prnpa strains showed that heterologous transmissions to 101LL mice produced levels of PrPSc identical to those seen in the homologous transmission to Prnpa mice, despite the difference in incubation times (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Similarly, transmission of 79V and 301V produced the same PrPSc levels in 101LL and Prnpa mice despite heterologous transmission in the presence of three and two PrP amino acid differences respectively. The difference seen between 101LL and Prnpa mice with 79V on this blot appears, on examination of the lanes without proteinase K treatment, to be due to protein loadings (Fig. 2a, lanes 5 to 8), as protein concentrations were calculated from wet weight of tissue. Previous analysis has shown PrPSc levels in these mice to be similar (data not shown). However, the heterologous challenge of 101LL mice with Prnpb strain 22A did show some degree of variation in the level of PrPSc present. Of three animals examined, one showed similar levels to those found on inoculation of Prnpa mice, but the others contained much lower levels (Fig. 2b, lanes 5 to 10). The presence of the 101L mutation therefore does not affect the level of PrPSc produced by some strains of agent, but can alter PrPSc levels with other strains independent of the Prnp genotype of the source of infectivity, as found here with 22A and previously with ME7 (Manson et al., 1999)..

The degree of vacuolation in specific brain areas is characteristic of individual mouse-passaged scrapie strains. Vacuolation is scored on a scale of 0 to 5 in nine grey matter and three white matter areas, and average scores ( plus or minus SEM) plotted to give a lesion profile, which is essentially a fingerprint for each strain (Fraser  and  Dickinson, 1967). Lesion profiles were produced for each strain of mouse scrapie, comparing mean vacuolation scores from 101LL and Prnpa mice displaying both clinical and pathological signs of TSE disease (Fig. 3). The heterologous transmission to 101LL mice of Prnpa-derived strains 139A and 79A produced significant variation in the targeting of vacuolation when compared with the corresponding homologous transmission in Prnpa mice. The 139A and 79A Prnpa-derived mouse scrapie strains share a common lineage, and produce identical lesion profiles in wild-type mice of both Prnp genotypes. These strains can, however, be distinguished by their incubation times in Prnpb (or Prnpa(108F/189V)) mice (Table 1, Fig. 1). Both of these strains displayed increased levels of vacuolation in areas 1 (dorsal medulla), 3 (superior colliculus), 4 (hypothalamus) and 7 (septum), but decreased levels of vacuolation in the white matter regions (1* cerebellar white matter, 2* midbrain white matter, 3* cerebral peduncle) of 101LL mice. The change in vacuolar profile and incubation time of these two related strains in 101LL mice appears identical (Figs 1, 3; Table 1), indicating a similar interaction between each strain and the 101L mutation in PrP. Heterologous challenges with Prnpb-derived strains (79V, 22A and 301V) produced less variability between Prnpa and 101LL mice, despite differing from the source of infectivity by two and three PrP amino acids respectively. Identical lesion profiles were obtained in 101LL and Prnpa mice challenged with 301V, and although 79V showed reduced levels of vacuolation in areas 6 to 9 (hippocampus, septum, cerebral cortex and forebrain cerebral cortex) of the 101LL brain, the overall pattern was the same as in Prnpa mice. The 22A strain showed slightly more variability due to altered levels of vacuolation in areas 4 (hypothalamus), 7 (septum) and 8 (cerebral cortex), but all other areas of grey and white matter showed identical targeting of vacuolation in both lines of mice. The 101L mutation therefore exerts a strain-specific effect on vacuolar targeting ranging from little or no alteration with heterologous challenges differing at three amino acids (108L, 189T and 101L), to major alterations with heterologous challenges differing at only one amino acid (101L), which was also observed previously with ME7 (Manson et al., 1999)..

The differences in PrP sequence between species are thought to reduce the efficiency of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, and result in low transmission frequencies and long incubation periods. However, TSE infectivity from human, hamster and sheep brain tissue has previously been transmitted to 101LL mice with reduced incubation times compared with wild-type mice, despite the lack of PrP sequence identity between species (Barron et al., 2001; Manson et al., 1999). The PrP sequence of C57BL mice (Prnpa) in which ME7, 139A and 79A are propagated differs from that of 101LL mice by only one amino acid (101P), yet incubation times in 101LL mice are 2-fold greater than in wild-type mice. The PrP sequence of VM mice (Prnpb) in which 79V, 301V and 22A are propagated differs from 101LL mice at three residues (101P, 108F and 189V); however, the effect is in this case far less predictable. With Prnpb-derived strains, incubation times observed in 101LL mice were also extended when compared with Prnpb mice, but were found to be both shorter (301V) and longer (79V and 22A) when compared with the Prnpa mice. Thus within the mouse species the presence of the 101L alteration prolongs the scrapie incubation time normally observed in the donor genotype. However for agents from other species, the effect of the 101L mutation appears in most cases to be to facilitate the transmission of disease, perhaps indicating that the 101L mutation allows more efficient adaptation of an agent in mice..

However, the degree to which incubation times are affected by 101L is distinct from 108/189, and is also very unpredictable with Prnpb-derived strains. Specific differences between 101L and 108/189 are also evident with some Prnpa-derived strains. The related strains 139A and 79A produce almost identical incubation times and lesion profiles in Prnpa mice, but can be distinguished by their incubation times in Prnpb and Prnpa(108F/189V) mice, where the 79A incubation time is approximately 140 days longer than 139A (Table 1, Fig. 1). On inoculation of 101LL mice, the 139A and 79A strains of agent produced almost identical incubation times and alterations in lesion profile (Table 1; Figs 1 and 3), proving that the 101L mutation alters the disease profile of these agents in a manner that is indeed distinct from that of 108/189. Future experiments involving mice expressing Prnpa(108F/189T) will allow us to examine the influence of L108F alone on TSE disease progression, and to directly compare the effect of the L108F and P101L alterations.

The introduction of methionine at positions 108 and 111 in murine PrP (to create the epitope for mAb 3F4) increased the incubation times of four mouse-passaged scrapie strains in transgenic mice overexpressing Prnpa(108M/111M) compared with mice overexpressing Prnpa (Supattapone et al., 2001). The mutations caused prolonged incubation times (ranging from 1 6- to 2 8-fold) for each of the scrapie strains investigated, independent of the Prnp genotype from which the strain was derived. Although the precise effects of the 108M/111M mutations are difficult to quantify in these experiments due to the differences in Prnp gene copy number and genetic background between control and mutant mice, the results suggested that mutations in this region of PrP may extend TSE incubation times with all mouse-passaged TSE isolates. However, in this experiment incubation times with 301V were extended in Prnpa(108M/111M) mice compared with the transgenic mice overexpressing Prnpa. This was not observed in 101LL mice, where a shortening of 301V incubation time occurred with respect to the wild-type Prnpa mice. These observations indicate that the effect on incubation time of introducing the 3F4 epitope is distinct from that caused by the presence of 101L in murine PrP..

Strain characteristics of this particular TSE agent have been show to remain remarkably consistent after transmission through several different species (Bruce et al., 1997). However, vCJD (which is thought to be human-passaged BSE) produced increased incubation times and altered lesion profiles in 101LL mice compared with wild-type mice (Barron et al., 2001), while BSE transmitted through a Prnpb mouse (301V) produced shortened incubation times (Table 1, Fig. 1) and unaltered lesion profiles in 101LL mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3). Adaptation to mouse with this strain of agent therefore increases the efficiency of transmission to 101LL mice, even in the presence of three polymorphisms in murine PrP, and this may in some way be related to why this human TSE agent alone transmits efficiently to wild-type mice (Bruce et al., 1997; Tateishi, 1996). These issues are currently being addressed by transmitting and subpassinging human TSE isolates in P101L mice (unpublished data)..

If the infectious process is dependent on interaction between PrP molecules, it is unclear why in 101LL mice the Prnpb-derived strains behave in a more unpredictable manner than the Prnpa-derived strains. It may be due to the presence of three amino acid changes between the 101LL host and the Prnpb line in which the agent was propagated. It is also possible that Prnpb strains have more diverse PrPSc conformations than the Prnpa strains we have examined. Alternatively, a direct interaction between PrPC and PrPSc may not define the infectious process. Other molecules may be involved in this process, and their interaction with PrPC may define the importance of PrP sequence in transmission of disease (Kaneko et al., 1997; Telling et al., 1995). We now aim to further define the nature of the interaction between the N terminus of host PrP and the infectious agent through the study of the other mutations in this region of PrP..

Approximately half of the deer tested showed evidence of PrPd in the brainstem or lymphoid tissues. Four PRNP alleles encoding amino acid substitutions were identified, with substitutions at residues 95 (QH), 96 (GS) or 116 (AG), each with serine (S) at residue 138. In addition, a processed pseudogene with two alleles encoding five or six copies of the octapeptide repeat was identified in 26 % of the deer. Both alleles encoded asparagine (N) at residue 138. The functional gene alleles sorted into five major diploid genotypes and four rare genotypes. Although all five major diploid genotypes were found in deer with CWD, unaffected deer were less likely to have the allele QGAS and more likely to have QSAS compared with CWD-affected deer. Late-stage disease (PrPd in brainstem) was noted in deer less than 1 year of age, although no single genotype was associated with this rapid neuroinvasion. Early-stage disease (PrPd distribution limited to the lymphoid system) was observed in deer estimated to be more than 5 years old, suggesting that they were infected as adults or that the incubation time might be extremely long in some individuals. The pseudogene was found in deer of all major PRNP genotypes and was not correlated with CWD status. The large number of susceptible genotypes and the possibility of adult-to-adult transmission suggest that much of the white-tailed deer population may be at risk for disease following exposure to CWD, despite the association of specific genotypes with CWD noted here..

Transmission and pathogenesis of the TSEs appear to involve a novel mechanism in which PrPd, a major protein component in tissue extracts from infected animals, catalyses the conversion of PrPc to the pathogenic PrPd molecule through a series of aggregation and post-translational secondary changes (Caughey et al., 1990; Horiuchi  and  Caughey, 1999; Safar et al., 1994). The  protein only  model is supported by experiments demonstrating that expression of PrPc in the host is a necessary prerequisite for disease (Bueler et al., 1993) and that the primary amino acid sequence of PrPc is associated with relative susceptibility to natural TSE infection in some species. Residues 136, 154 and 171, alone or in combination, control relative susceptibility and incubation time in sheep (Belt et al., 1995; Bossers et al., 1996; Clouscard et al., 1995; Goldmann et al., 1994a, b; Hunter et al., 1992, 1994; O'Rourke et al., 1997; Westaway et al., 1994). Predisposing genotypes in elk with CWD (O'Rourke et al., 1999) and in humans with iatrogenic, sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (Collinge et al., 1991, 1996; Palmer et al., 1991) are associated with mutations at a single site (elk codon 132 and the corresponding human codon 129). Genetic analysis of susceptible or predisposing prion protein precursor gene (PRNP) alleles in mule deer is complicated by the nearly universal presence of an unexpressed processed pseudogene (PRNP) in which exon 3 encodes a polymorphic open reading frame (ORF) (Brayton et al., 2004). In this study, we examined the PRNP functional gene and pseudogene alleles in a herd of white-tailed deer with a high prevalence of naturally occurring CWD to investigate the possibility of predisposing genotypes in this species..

Tissues were collected from white-tailed deer on a ranch in Sioux county in the northwest corner of Nebraska, USA, within the CWD endemic area. In 1992, an area of pine-covered steep hills containing many deep ravines was enclosed with a 3 m net and barbed-wire fence. An estimated 20 to 30 free-ranging white-tailed deer and a smaller number of mule deer were inadvertently fenced in this enclosure. This herd was allowed to multiply into a population as high as 300 head over the next 10 years. Food plots, creep feeders with trace minerals and hay were used to supplement the deer in this enclosure. Some losses to enzootic haemorrhagic disease of deer in the enclosure coincided with similar losses in deer outside the fence. No deer in poor body condition or with symptoms suggestive of CWD were noted. From 1992 to 2001, animals were removed during guided hunts that met all of the State of Nebraska Game and Parks Division season and permit requirements. A group of bull elk was placed in the deer enclosure in 1998 and those not harvested by hunters were moved to an adjacent pasture. In 2001, CWD surveillance was initiated and positive deer were found in the first group sampled. The entire enclosure and several acres at the perimeter were depopulated in early 2002 under an agreement between the property owner and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. All deer (n=172) were removed from within the fenced area. Thirty-nine animals were excluded from the study because the submission lacked either a complete tissue set (formalin-fixed brain, tonsil and retropharyngeal lymph node) for CWD status determination or a frozen tissue sample suitable for genetic analysis. Diagnostic testing was performed by the Colorado State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory or the Wyoming Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. All animals were in good body condition when killed. Most of the deer were killed in late winter (January to March) 2002. White-tailed deer breed seasonally and fawns were 7 to 10 months of age when the herd was depopulated.

Primer pairs specific for amplification of PRNP and PRNP were derived from the corresponding sequences from mule deer (GenBank accession nos AY330343 and AY371694). Intron to exon borders were derived from the sequences of bovine PRNP cDNA and genomic DNA (GenBank accession nos AB001468 and AJ298878) and cDNA from mule deer (K. I. O'Rourke, unpublished data). PCR amplification was performed using a universal prion primer pair amplifying an 800 bp fragment including the entire ORF in exon 3 of PRNP and PRNP (forward primer 247 5'-atggtgaaaagccacataggcag-3', beginning with the initiation site for PrP translation and reverse primer 224 5'-agaagataatgaaaacaggaag-3', beginning 8 bp after the termination codon); a primer pair specific for the functional gene (forward primer 223 5'-acaccctctttattttgcag-3' in intron 2 and reverse primer 224), yielding an 830 bp product; and two primer pairs specific for the pseudogene (forward primer 379 5'-aagaaaattcctgagagagcat-3' containing the pseudogene flanking repeat sequence and the adjacent 8 bp from exon 1 or forward primer 369 5'-caaccaagtcgaagcatct-3' from exon 2; reverse primer 224 was used in both cases). Amplification of DNA from deer with PRNP yielded a product of 950 to 974 bp with primers 379/224 and 875 to 899 bp with primers 369/224, depending on the octapeptide repeat number. Although primers 369/224 annealed to PRNP and to PRNP, the intervening intron in PRNP (deleted in PRNP) precluded efficient amplification of the functional gene and therefore the primer pair selectively amplified PRNP under the conditions used. All PCR reactions were as follows: 95  degrees C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95  degrees C, 30 s), annealing (54  degrees C, 30 s) and extension (72  degrees C, 59 s) followed by an extension cycle (72  degrees C, 7 min) under standard buffer conditions with 2 5 mM MgCl2 (Qiagen). PCR products were analysed on 1 % agarose ethidium-bromide-stained gels. PRNP amplification reactions were scored for the presence or absence of a pseudogene-specific band..

Animals were considered to be in early disease if the tonsil or retropharyngeal node was positive but no immunostaining was evident in the DMNV (Spraker et al., 2002b). Animals were considered to be in late disease if PrPd was detected in brain as well as lymphoid tissue. Deer with no detectable PrPd in brain or nodes were considered  No PrPd . These animals were not considered CWD-free because of the long undefined incubation period between infection and accumulation of detectable PrPd..

The white-tailed deer PRNP was amplified using each of two pseudogene-specific primer pairs: forward primer 379 incorporating the 5' pseudogene repeat (Fig. 1) and the 5' end of the truncated exon 1, or forward primer 369 from exon 2, each paired with the 3' universal prion reverse primer at the end of the ORF. Products were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) and all amplicons sequenced directly or after TOPO cloning. Of 133 samples, 35 (26 %) yielded an amplification product with the pseudogene-specific primers. Sequence analysis of TOPO-cloned products demonstrated that the organization of PRNP in white-tailed deer (GenBank accession no. AY425673) was similar to that in mule deer (GenBank accession no. AY371694), containing a truncated exon 1 contiguous with exon 2 and exon 3 sequences (Fig. 1). The 5' sequence flanking the pseudogene was identical to that of mule deer [5'-(aa)gaaaattcctgaga-3']. This sequence was identified at the 5' end of the white-tailed deer pseudogene. Because of the similarity with the mule deer pseudogene, it is very likely that this flanking sequence is a part of a repeat also found at the 3' terminus of the pseudogene. The PRNP sequence in white-tailed deer was identical to that of the most common allele in mule deer and lacked the heterogeneity of the mule deer PRNP (Brayton et al., 2004). No single base pair changes were identified among the white-tailed deer PRNP sequences. Variation was observed in the octapeptide repeat number in the pseudogene, with either five (n=29 deer) or six (n=6 deer) repeat units observed. The longer allele had a 24 bp insertion after the second repeat unit; the other five repeat units were identical to those in the shorter pseudogene allele and in the functional gene. All functional gene alleles encoded serine (S) at codon 138 and all pseudogene alleles encoded asparagine (N), as observed in mule deer..

Deer either haploid (2=6 52, 1 df, P=0 01) or diploid (2=9 36, 1 df, P < 0 01) for the QGAS allele were more frequently affected by CWD compared with deer lacking this allele.

The post-translational change from PrPc to PrPd is thought to be a two-step process of PrPc/PrPd aggregation (Horiuchi  and  Caughey, 1999) followed by conversion of PrPc to the -sheet-enriched protease-resistant protein (Cohen  and  Prusiner, 1998). Amino acid substitutions that contribute to the efficiency of the aggregation step or the stability of the disease-associated isoform (Supattapone et al., 2001) are expected to be associated with increased susceptibility or decreased incubation time. In ruminant herbivores with naturally occurring TSEs, susceptibility to natural challenge is estimated from the proportion of affected and unaffected animals of each genotype in populations with a presumed uniform exposure to the disease-causing agent. The low prevalence of CWD in free-ranging populations of deer and elk complicate a similar analysis of genetic susceptibility to CWD. We identified a group of wild deer, confined to a single large area, with CWD diagnosed in approximately 50 % of the animals.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	29	The ORF of the PRNP gene was more variable in this group of deer than was reported previously for free-ranging elk (O'Rourke et al., 1999) or mule deer (Brayton et al., 2004) and was duplicated in the cervid prion pseudogene PRNP as described previously in mule deer (Brayton et al., 2004). The presumed wild-type allele (QGAS) and three alleles with coding changes at codons 95 (H), 96 (S) or 116 (G) were identified in the functional gene. In addition, a coding change at codon 138 distinguished PRNP (138S) from PRNP (138N) in this sample set. Both the location and potential charge shift of the three amino acid replacements in the functional gene are of interest. The H/Q polymorphism at position 95 results in substitution of a neutral for a polar residue but is commonly reported in the deduced amino acid sequences from the PRNP gene among and within a large number of species (Schatzl et al., 1995; Van Rheede et al., 2003; Wopfner et al., 1999). Residue 96, encoding G or S, is adjacent to the final octapeptide repeat in a region poorly conserved among the mammalian species examined, with insertions and single base changes reported (Van Rheede et al., 2003). Although there was no evidence for resistance to disease in deer with any of the major genotypes in this study, deer lacking the QGAS allele and carrying one or two copies of the allele encoding 96S (QSAS) were less likely to be found in the CWD population than deer with the QGAS allele on one or both chromosomes. This finding is consistent with data from deer in Wisconsin (Johnson et al., 2003), although in that study universal prion primers were used and the functional genotype could not be determined for some animals from the data shown. The sample sizes in both studies are relatively small (26 in Wisconsin, 67 in this study). If larger sample sizes support these observations, however, the pattern of genetic susceptibility in white-tailed deer would be similar to that observed in Rocky Mountain elk, in which a predisposing genotype is reported (O'Rourke et al., 1999), although all major genotypes are susceptible to CWD (Spraker et al., 2004). In contrast, PRNP polymorphisms in sheep result in the lack of disease in virtually all sheep with resistant genotypes (Belt et al., 1995; Bossers et al., 1996; Clouscard et al., 1995; Goldmann et al., 1994a, b; Hunter et al., 1992, 1994, 1997; O'Rourke et al., 1997; Westaway et al., 1994)..
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	30	The ORF of the PRNP gene was more variable in this group of deer than was reported previously for free-ranging elk (O'Rourke et al., 1999) or mule deer (Brayton et al., 2004) and was duplicated in the cervid prion pseudogene PRNP as described previously in mule deer (Brayton et al., 2004). The presumed wild-type allele (QGAS) and three alleles with coding changes at codons 95 (H), 96 (S) or 116 (G) were identified in the functional gene. In addition, a coding change at codon 138 distinguished PRNP (138S) from PRNP (138N) in this sample set. Both the location and potential charge shift of the three amino acid replacements in the functional gene are of interest. The H/Q polymorphism at position 95 results in substitution of a neutral for a polar residue but is commonly reported in the deduced amino acid sequences from the PRNP gene among and within a large number of species (Schatzl et al., 1995; Van Rheede et al., 2003; Wopfner et al., 1999). Residue 96, encoding G or S, is adjacent to the final octapeptide repeat in a region poorly conserved among the mammalian species examined, with insertions and single base changes reported (Van Rheede et al., 2003). Although there was no evidence for resistance to disease in deer with any of the major genotypes in this study, deer lacking the QGAS allele and carrying one or two copies of the allele encoding 96S (QSAS) were less likely to be found in the CWD population than deer with the QGAS allele on one or both chromosomes. This finding is consistent with data from deer in Wisconsin (Johnson et al., 2003), although in that study universal prion primers were used and the functional genotype could not be determined for some animals from the data shown. The sample sizes in both studies are relatively small (26 in Wisconsin, 67 in this study). If larger sample sizes support these observations, however, the pattern of genetic susceptibility in white-tailed deer would be similar to that observed in Rocky Mountain elk, in which a predisposing genotype is reported (O'Rourke et al., 1999), although all major genotypes are susceptible to CWD (Spraker et al., 2004).

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	31	The polymorphism at codon 116 of the functional gene is of interest. The alanine (A) residue at this position is conserved across a large number of eutherian orders (Van Rheede et al., 2003) and previously reported to be variant only in the tenrec, an insectivorous mammal found only on the island of Madagascar. Residue 116 (human 113) is in a potential membrane-spanning domain (Hegde et al., 1998) of PrPc, immediately adjacent to a proposed cleavage site for cytosolically derived protease but protected from proteolysis by its insertion through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (Hegde et al., 1998). The AG mutation at residue 116 in white-tailed deer results in replacement of a hydrophobic, aliphatic residue with a polar residue and may affect the intracellular processing and transport of the PrP precursor. However, in this study, the 116G allele was found in 13 CWD-positive heterozygous deer, demonstrating that the allele does not provide protection under these conditions. Two 116G homozygous animals were identified (one adult and one fawn), arguing against an early lethal effect of the mutation. Neither homozygous deer had detectable PrPd or neurodegenerative changes..

PRNP was characterized by a polymorphism not detected in the functional gene and heterogeneity was limited to a variable octapeptide repeat number. The low frequency and lack of heterogeneity of the white-tailed deer pseudogene could be due to inbreeding within this confined herd, to polymorphisms in the primer binding sites resulting in detection of a limited subset of alleles or to a relatively recent introduction of the pseudogene into the genome of white-tailed deer. Although the founder group in the study herd was estimated at fewer than 20 animals, loss of heterogeneity in the pseudogene due to inbreeding is an unlikely explanation because all functional alleles identified in the Wisconsin (Johnson et al., 2003), Mississippi (unpublished data) and Wyoming (Heaton et al., 2003) groups are represented in this herd. Furthermore, using the 138N polymorphism as a marker for PNRP in the Wisconsin and Wyoming studies, pseudogene frequencies are similar among the groups. Polymorphisms in the PCR primer-binding sites cannot be ruled out. However, the pseudogene was detected with two primer pairs in all deer in which the 138N mutation was detected with the universal prion primer pair, suggesting that failure to amplify a novel PRNP allele is not likely. The third explanation is the appearance of the pseudogene in O. hemionus (mule deer and other black-tailed deer) after divergence from white-tailed deer, with limited and relatively recent introgression into the white-tailed deer genome through hybridization of ancestral sympatric populations. Although the evolution and taxonomy of the dozens of subspecies of white-tailed and black-tailed deer in the Americas are complex, examination of mitochondrial DNA and Y-linked genes supports the model that white-tailed deer and black-tailed deer diverged on the North American continent during the Pleistocene, with subsequent hybridization of sympatric populations resulting in appearance of mule deer (reviewed by Geist  and  Francis, 1999). Subsequent hybridization between mule deer and white-tailed deer probably occurred (and continues to occur) infrequently, with a low level of introgressive hybridization of maternal DNA from mule deer and black-tailed deer into white-tailed deer populations within limited geographic areas (Cronin, 1991)..

These changes were not seen in the functional gene, leaving unresolved the question of whether the changes occurred in the ancestral functional gene before the duplication event or in the processed pseudogene after duplication. The substitution of N for S in the prion protein is common within and among species and functional alleles encoding 138N are common in fallow deer (Dama dama) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (unpublished data). Likewise, a variable octapeptide repeat number is common in some breeds of cattle. There are several dozen subspecies of Odocoileus in the Americas and genetic examination of additional populations should demonstrate whether the changes noted in the pseudogene in this study are characteristic of the processed pseudogene or are found in functional alleles as well. No evidence of the pseudogene was found in small populations of New World moose (Alces alces), holoarctic reindeer, Old World Rocky Mountain elk (C. elaphus) or captive Asian fallow deer (unpublished data). If PRNP arose after evolutionary radiation of Odocoileus species in the New World, this pseudogene is not likely to be found in more distantly related members of the order Artiodactyla such as sheep, cattle or goats. Novel pseudogenes may yet be found in some populations of domestic livestock through judicious selection of primer pairs optimized for pseudogene discovery. However, processed pseudogenes are not typically transcribed or translated (Mighell et al., 2000) and are therefore not expected to affect susceptibility to a protein-based disorder..

We addressed the possibility of genetically controlled differences in incubation time (the period from infection until accumulation of detectable PrPd in the brain) by examining fawns (animals under 1 year of age) for late disease (PrPd in the brain). Using this crude measure, we identified three fawns (QGAS QSAS and QGAS QGGS genotypes) with late disease, demonstrating an extremely rapid course in those animals. PrPd is thought to accumulate first in the lymphoid tissues of the alimentary tract (Sigurdson et al., 1999), with subsequent neuroinvasion and transport through the splenic or vagus nerves to the brain. In experimental rodent models, the incubation time and neuroinvasion rate are associated with a number of variables, including PRNP polymorphisms (Dickinson  and  Outram, 1973), innervation and PrPc production in lymphoid tissues (Mabbott et al., 2000; Glatzel et al., 2001), and route of infection (Bartz et al., 2003). Transgenic mice with cervid PRNP genes may be an appropriate laboratory model for examining the extremely rapid neuroinvasion seen in some genotypes..

W. Miller, personal communication). In spite of an infection rate of nearly 50 % in this herd, no clinical evidence of CWD was noted in live deer by the property owner or hunters or at necropsy. Losses to intercurrent viral diseases were extensive during some years and the terrain provided adequate cover for sick animals to evade detection prior to death, possibly masking the presence of a TSE in this herd. Alternately, the clinical course in these white-tailed deer may have been more acute than described in mule deer due to differences in the biology of the cervid host, the strain of TSE agent in this herd or the dose of the disease-causing agent in this confined facility. Additional observations on clinical CWD in white-tailed deer held in captive settings will be necessary to address the spectrum of phenotypes of TSE infection in cervids..
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	40	PRNP alleles and diploid genotypes of white-tailed deer with CWD identify those associated with CWD susceptibility. In contrast, disease resistance is considerably more challenging to define in free-ranging populations for several reasons. First, equivalent exposure to the disease-causing agent cannot be demonstrated across the population. Although the deer in this study were removed from a single fenced area, it is likely that the herd spent part of the year in small maternally related groups, congregating at feed plots and at natural watering areas. CWD transmission routes are not known and the relative efficiency of transmission through deer-to-deer contact or through shared feed and water sources cannot be determined. Microsatellite analysis of DNA from the affected animals needs to be performed to determine whether maternal contact increases the probability of infection. Secondly, some of the alleles are relatively rare and additional study populations from the endemic areas or from selectively bred captive white-tailed deer will be needed to increase the sample size in these genotypes. Thirdly, the interval from infection to the accumulation of detectable PrPd levels is not known. CWD was diagnosed in deer at 8 to 10 months of age in this herd, establishing a minimum incubation period. The maximum incubation period cannot be identified if infection times occur outside the perinatal period (Miller  and  Williams, 2003). Some older adult deer had detectable PrPd restricted to the lymphoid tissue. If the temporal pattern of PrPd accumulation in white-tailed deer is similar to that in sheep (Hadlow et al., 1982) or experimentally infected mule deer (Sigurdson et al., 1999), this observation indicates that white-tailed deer can be infected as adults, as reported in mule deer (Miller  and  Williams, 2003) or that the incubation period can be as long as 5 years. Failure to detect PrPd in some deer is less likely to be due to genetic differences than to the termination of the entire herd for regulatory reasons while some or all deer were in the very early stage of the disease, before PrPd is detectable. Long-term observations of heavily exposed herds or direct oral challenge of captive deer will be needed to establish relative disease resistance in deer with the rare genotypes. However, the presence of a relatively resistant but rare genotype may not confer a selective advantage sufficient to reduce the prevalence of CWD in free-ranging herds..

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Introduction Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results and Discussion References   Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal `scrapie' isoform of the prion protein called PrPSc in the brain (Prusiner et al., 1998). According to the prion hypothesis, the infectious isoform PrPSc can trigger the autocatalytic conversion of the normal `cellular' prion protein PrPC into PrPSc (Prusiner et al., 1990). However, certain cofactors, such as protein X or laminin-receptor precursor might also play a role in the conversion process (Kaneko et al., 1997; Leucht et al., 2003). Currently, no treatment is available to cure TSEs. A number of chemical molecules, targeting PrPSc itself or PrPSc replication, were discovered either serendipitously, such as branched polyamines (Supattapone et al., 1999), phtalocyanines and porphyrin derivatives (Caughey et al., 1998), or by using a more rational approach with the help of structure-based drug design, such as the identification of compound 60 (Perrier et al., 2000). These molecules were able to cure scrapie-infected cells of their infectivity, they were, however, poorly efficient on mice once the clinical symptoms had developed. Because PrPC is a major cellular requirement for the propagation of infectivity (Bueler et al., 1993), it represents an attractive therapeutic target. Recent studies on conditional Prnp knockout mice, showing that the inhibition of the PrPC production in neurons was able to prevent or stop the development of the disease, emphasized the importance of therapeutic strategies targeting PrPC (Mallucci et al., 2003)..

Sheep carrying the polymorphisms Q/R or R/R at codon 171 of the PrP protein were resistant to different isolates of scrapie, whereas sheep harboring the Q/Q alleles developed prion disease (Belt et al., 1995; Bossers et al., 1996; Goldmann et al., 1994). Human genetic studies revealed that the gene encoding the prion protein has a large repertoire of polymorphisms and mutations. Studies among the Japanese population found that, 12% carried the polymorphism E/K at codon 219 of the PrP protein, whereas the remainder carried the E/E alleles. Because E/K-heterozygosity at codon 219 was not reported on the 85 autopsied cases of patients with sporadic CJD, this therefore suggests that the polymorphism E/K protects humans from prion diseases (Shibuya et al., 1998). Kaneko et al. introduced the Q171R sheep mutation and E219K human mutation in the mouse Prnp gene (MoPrPQ167R and MoPrPQ218K respectively) (Kaneko et al., 1997). These mutated PrPs could not be converted into the abnormal PrPSc isoform and, significantly, they also inhibited the formation of 3F4-tagged mouse PrPSc molecules during co-transfection experiments (Kaneko et al., 1997). The substitutions Q167R and Q218K in MoPrP were therefore described as dominant negative mutants because they block the replication of their wild-type counterparts (Kaneko et al., 1997). Recently, Perrier et al. analyzed the dominant negative inhibition effect in transgenic mice (Perrier et al., 2002). Transgenic mice carrying PrP with Q167R or Q218K substitutions on a Prnp to / to  background, were unable to replicate and propagate prion diseases. In transgenic mice, whose wild-type (wt) Prnp gene was re-inserted, the conversion of wt PrPC into PrPSc was dramatically slowed down and correlated with an increase in the incubation time in these animals. This dominant negative effect seemed to depend on a particular ratio of the mutated PrP molecules produced by the transgene and the endogenous wt PrP molecules..

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	36	   Results and Discussion Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results and Discussion References   Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer provides a potentially useful tool for therapeutic strategies because it can transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, such as neurons, in a stable and long term fashion (Blomer et al., 1997; Blomer et al., 1996; Marr et al., 2003; Naldini et al., 1996). This system also allows the transfer of genes without any selection process, preventing an eventual undesirable clonal effect. We therefore developed FIV-derived vectors to evaluate a gene transfer therapeutic strategy by using the inhibitory properties of PrP dominant negative mutants against prion replication. We prepared VSV-G and pseudotyped FIV vectors containing the mouse Prnp gene in which the Q167R or Q218K mutations were generated by PCR mutagenesis. To identify the transduced cells and measure the efficiency of transduction, the gene of interest in these vectors is followed by an IRES sequence and a reporter gene coding for GFP. Virion particles were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with a three-plasmid expression-system (Fig. 1): the gene transfer vector carrying the mutated Prnp genes, the FIV-derived packaging plasmid coding for structural proteins of virions and the VSV-G envelope plasmid that determines the cellular pseudotyping. Virions produced in the culture medium were filtrated and concentrated by successive ultra-centrifugations (Curran et al., 2000). The viral titers were determined by counting the number of GFP positive fluorescent cells using FACS analysis after transduction of HEK293T cells with different dilutions of the virions. These titers were about 3.5x108 to 8.8x108 TU/ml..

The similar levels of PrPC detected agree with the identical viral titers used for the transduction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence of these cells also showed that the mutated proteins were correctly exported at the cell surface, which suggests that dominant negative mutations do not affect the cellular trafficking of the PrP protein (Fig. 2C)..

This N2a58/22L cell line provides a model for prion replication because it constitutively produces high levels of PrPSc proteins (Nishida et al., 2000). The cells were transduced with the different preparations of virions using a MOI of 1.

Every four days, the cellular lysates were collected and proteinase-K-treated to analyse the inhibition-kinetic of the endogenous MoPrPSc levels by immunoblotting. After 8 and 12 days, the N2a58/22L cells expressing the dominant negative MoPrPQ167R and MoPrPQ218K mutants showed a strong reduction in endogenous wt MoPrPSc levels (Fig. 3B). After 15 days of culture, the majority of PrPSc was cleared (Fig. 3C). To confirm the elimination of PrPSc, we performed a SAF61 immunocytofluorescence of the PrPSc after 20 days. We used a standard guanidinium thiocyanate protocol that allows PrPSc staining by promoting antigen retrieval of the PrPSc and elimination of PrPC staining (Mange et al., 2004). This method also showed a large decrease of PrPSc in cells containing the dominant negative construct (Fig. 3D); the inhibitory effect was reproduced in three independent experiments (data not shown). Generally, these results show that the virions harboring the PrP dominant negative mutants are functional and that they are efficient to inhibit the endogenous wt PrPSc-conversion. These results are in accordance with those obtained in previous studies (Kaneko et al., 1997; Perrier et al., 2002) who showed that inhibition of wt MoPrPSc-formation can occur with MoPrPQ167R and MoPrPQ218K mutants. In addition, the lentiviral gene-transfer method allowed us to amplify the inhibitory effect of these dominant negative mutants in scrapie-infected cells. The transient transfections of prion-infected cells performed by Kaneko et al. (Kaneko et al., 1997), resulted in only a minority of cells expressing the PrP mutants, which had an inhibitory effect only on the conversion of 3F4-tagged MoPrPC but not on the conversion of endogenous wild-type PrPC into PrPSc. In our case, and because the majority of the cells expressed the PrP mutants, we were able to obtain a strong inhibition of the conversion of the endogenous wt PrPC into PrPSc. Our results show that the delivery of dominant negative PrP mutants through lentiviral vectors, can not only provide a strong expression of the transgene, but also transdominantly inhibit the accumulation of the endogenous wt MoPrPSc in chronically scrapie-infected N2a58/22L cells..

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	45	Lentiviral vectors possess the ability to transduce post-mitotic cells such as differentiated neurons as well as the cells of the lymphoreticular system in a prolonged and stable manner (Aguzzi et al., 2003; Blomer et al., 1997; Blomer et al., 1996; Glatzel et al., 2004; Mabbott and Bruce, 2003; Mangeot et al., 2002; Naldini et al., 1996). To analyse whether our lentiviral vectors had the potential to deliver the gene to the brain or the peripheric organs, we performed ic and iv injections of lentivirus expressing the ss-galactosidase gene in mice. For ic delivery, we used a stereotaxic frame to inject the lentiviral preparation in the right lateral ventricle or in the thalamus of adult C57BL/6 mice. ss-galactosidase expression was assessed by direct X-Gal staining of the entire brain. Following the intrathalamic injection, we observed a ss-galactosidase activity mainly in the injection site (Fig. 4A,B,E), which demonstrated the capacity of our lentivirus to transduce neural cells. Following intraventricular injection, X-Gal-blue coloration was limited all along the syringe trajectory and around the lateral ventricle (Fig. 4C,D). This was probably owing to the diffusion of the lentiviral particle in the whole ventricle. However, close examination of the brain by immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to detect ss-galactosidase staining in the area of striatum, the cortex and in some more distant sites as well as the area of the cerebellum (Fig. 4I-K). After systemic lentiviral injections, ss-galactosidase was observed around the blood vessels in the spleen of the mice and in some dispersed liver cells, probably due to the iv injection (Fig. 4L-Q). The spleen localisation in the vicinity of the vessels is somehow very pertinent because these structures are innervated by the noradrenergic peripheric autonomous nervous system implicated in the neuroinvasion process (Aguzzi et al., 2003; Bencsik et al., 2001; Haik et al., 2004; Prinz et al., 2003). These data showed that our lentiviral vectors can be used to transduce cells in the brain and in the spleen. Because neurons are the main cells targeted in prion disease, the use of lentiviral vectors carrying dominant negative PrP mutants could slow or even prevent prion replication, at least in the brain area transduced with the virion particles. In addition, the first stages of prion diseases are characterized by an increase of the PrPSc levels in the lymphoreticular system and in the spleen (Lasmezas et al., 1996; Maignien et al., 1999). Thus, lentiviral vectors could be useful effectors for the development of a gene therapy through repeated peripheral injections, with the aim of slowing down or preventing prion replication during the very early stages of disease, at least before neuroinvasion. Moreover, a gene therapy strategy was recently evaluated by Marr et al., as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Marr et al., 2003). Lentiviral vectors expressing neprilysin, a major Ass-degrading enzyme identified in the human brain and implicated in the clearance of Ass amyloids, was tested in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis. A single lentiviral injection decreased the number and size of amyloid plaques by about 45%. Altogether, these data have encouraged us to further evaluate therapeutic strategies based on injections of the lentivirus carrying dominant negative PrP mutants, by both ic and peripheral routes. Moreover, the recent and promising results of the neuroprotective cell-therapy treatment have prompted us to consider an approach combining both cell therapy and gene therapy using these dominant negative PrP mutants (Bachoud-Levi et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2001; Brustle and McKay, 1996; Lindvall, 2003; Lindvall and McKay, 2003). Indeed, neural precursors obtained after in vitro differentiation from embryonic stem cells could thus be transduced with the dominant negative PrP virion preparations before injection in the prion-infected brain. The recent description of soluble dimeric PrP (Meier et al., 2003) or RNAi interferences (Daude et al., 2003) that, antagonize prion replication may also be engineered in lentiviral vectors to extend the inhibitory effect..

Using DNA sequences from 363 deer, dimorphisms at codons 20 (aspartate/glycine) and 225 [serine (S)/phenylalanine (F)] were found; silent changes occurred at codons 131 (tyrosine) and 247 (isoleucine). The remaining samples were surveyed for codon 225 genotype and all were characterized for chronic wasting disease (CWD) infection status. A total of 112 deer with the genotype 225SF or FF were found, of which one was CWD-positive; 1370 were 225SS, with 289 positive for CWD. Among CWD-negative deer, the frequency of 225SF/FF genotypes was 9 3 % but among CWD-positive deer it was only 0 3 %. For all samples combined, CWD status was not independent of codon 225 genotype (P < 0 0001). The odds that a deer of the 225SS genotype was CWD-infected were 30 times greater (95 % confidence intervals=4 to 213) than for a 225SF deer. The proportion of 225SF animals in sampled subpopulations varied from 0 to 18 %; the CWD prevalence varied from 0 to 25 %. However, no relationship was observed between genotype frequency and CWD prevalence in different areas. The PrP sequences of experimentally infected mule deer were analysed from pre-existing projects and 10 animals were found with 225SF genotypes, all of which were positive for CWD. Data available from some of these animals suggest that the 225SF genotype could be associated with longer incubation periods in CWD infection compared with the 225SS genotype..

0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	7	Although CWD is not perceived as an immediate major threat to deer or elk populations, it is of concern and interest for several reasons: (i) the possibility that wild herds could be gradually destroyed by CWD (Gross  and  Miller, 2001) due to the persistence of the infectious agent in the environment (Miller et al., 1998, 2004; Williams et al., 2002) and the lethality of the disease; (ii) the unknown nature of circumstances, if any, under which this disease could affect a human; (iii) the greater understanding of human TSEs that could accrue by knowing more about related mammalian prion diseases that have not been well understood before; (iv) the economic impact of CWD on game farming; and (v) the possible spread of CWD to other members of the cervid family worldwide through unregulated commerce and transport of captive animals (Williams  and  Miller, 2003)..
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	8	In other acquired prion diseases, notably scrapie of sheep and variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, amino acids encoded at certain key positions in the endogenous host prion protein (PrP) are strongly associated with susceptibility to TSE infection (Goldmann et al., 1994; Hunter et al., 1994; Collinge et al., 1996; O'Rourke et al., 1997). A study of CWD in Rocky Mountain elk (O'Rourke et al., 1999) suggested that the PrP sequence at position 132 influences likelihood of infection in that species. To what extent similar influences affect deer (Odocoileus spp.) has been unclear (Johnson et al., 2003; Brayton et al., 2004; O'Rourke et al., 2004). If heritable characters influence susceptibility to CWD in free-ranging mule deer, which are the most abundant of the three natural hosts within the Rocky Mountain endemic area (Miller et al., 2000), it could have important implications for understanding the epidemiology of this disease..

To that end we determined PrP polymorphisms in select populations of free-ranging mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado, and estimated the relative abundance of one particular polymorphism among CWD-infected and uninfected animals. Specifically, we tested whether CWD status (positive or negative) was independent of genotype at codon 225, and constructed a regression model to test whether there was a population-level relationship between CWD prevalence and 225 genotype among the herds sampled. We also retrospectively analysed experimentally infected deer for PrP genotype to look for possible effects of genotype during the course of the disease in these animals..

The complete open reading frame (ORF) plus 25 bp of 5' flanking sequences and 53 bp of 3' flanking sequences in the PrP-coding region were amplified using PCR in 50  microl reaction volumes containing 200  microM each dNTP, 2 5 units Taq polymerase (Qiagen), 200 nM each of a forward (MD582F, 5'-ACATGGGCATATGATGCTGACACC-3') and a reverse (MD1479RC, 5'-ACTACAGGGCTGCAGGTAGATACT-3') primer, 2 5 mM MgCl2, 1x Qiagen PCR buffer and approximately 70 to 150 ng total genomic DNA. Reactions were thermal-cycled in a PTC 200 (MJ Research) at 94  degrees C for 5 min and then 32 cycles of 94  degrees C for 7 s, 62  degrees C for 15 s, 72  degrees C for 30 s and a final cycle of 72  degrees C for 5 min, and kept at 4  degrees C until inspected for successful amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis before being submitted for DNA sequencing with reverse sense primers 12 (5'-TGGTGGTGACTGTGTGTTGCTTGA-3') and 3FL1 (5'-GATTAAGAAGATAATGAAAACAGGAAGG-3') (Amplicon Express). In order to find recurring (5 % allele frequency) polymorphisms in deer over a widespread area, we examined sequences of the complete PrP ORF (Fig. 2a) from 363 samples that included 244 mule deer (95 CWD-negative, 149 CWD-positive) from throughout the south-eastern quarter of Wyoming, and 119 mule deer (105 CWD-negative, 14 CWD-positive) from the Estes Valley, Colorado.

The mature peptide is deduced to include aa 25 through 234. Features and their positions are based on similarities of mule deer PrP sequence (GenBank AY228473) to published analyses (as cited) of prion proteins of other species. The signal peptide cleavage site is as predicted by SignalP 3.0 (Bendtsen et al., 2004); the octapeptide repeat region was determined by inspection of translation of DNA sequence AY228473; 1 and 2 are residues that form a short, two-stranded antiparallel -sheet; -1, 2 and 3 are helices (Billeter et al., 1997; Gossert et al., 2005); CHO are sites of N-linked glycosylation (Kornfeld  and  Kornfeld, 1985; Haraguchi et al., 1989); S-S is a disulfide bond (Turk et al., 1988); and GPI is a deduced site of cleavage and attachment of glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchor (Stahl et al., 1987; Coyne et al., 1993).

To increase sample size for statistical analysis, PrP genotypes of 1119 additional samples selected from HUs in the study areas were analysed by EcoRI restriction digestion of the PCR-amplified PrP region, produced as described for samples to be sequenced. This assay detects only the codon 225 polymorphism, which is the only one we found in mule deer PrP that encoded different amino acids in the mature polypeptide. Aliquots (10  microl) of completed PCR reactions were incubated with 10 U EcoRI (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 12  microl containing 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0 025 % Triton X-100 (pH 7 5) at 37  degrees C for 2 to 16 h followed by the addition of 2 5  microl 6x concentrate gel loading solution (Sigma-Aldrich) per sample, and the inspection of products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Occurrence of the phenylalanine (F) codon TTC at position 225 creates the EcoRI recognition sequence and cleavage site GAATTC from codons 224 to 225, whereas the serine (S) codon TCC creates the DNA sequence GAATCC, which is not cut by EcoRI. When PCR products were incubated with EcoRI, the presence of a TTC codon at position 225 resulted in cleavage fragments of predictable sizes, and a search of the PrP ORF DNA sequence verified that no other sites were potentially transformable to GAATTC with one base change, supporting the use of this as a valid genotyping method. Samples that showed evidence of cleavage were sequenced to verify the change..

The 1482 deer that were genotyped and tested for CWD were a subset of deer tested from the 2001 to 2003 CWD hunter harvest surveys in Wyoming or from 2002 to 2004 field studies in north-central Colorado (Wolfe et al., 2002, 2004). For Wyoming data, tissues from sampled deer were screened for CWD infection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Miller  and  Williams, 2002) at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, Laramie, WY (2001 and 2002 samples) or by CWD-ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at the Wildlife Disease Laboratory of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department with IHC confirmation of ELISA-positive samples (2003 samples). For Colorado data, IHC was performed on tonsil biopsies from live deer sampled from Estes Park during 2002 to 2004 (Wolfe et al., 2002, 2004). CWD prevalence for Wyoming mule deer HUs was estimated using data obtained from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (H. Edwards, personal communication); CWD prevalence for Colorado DAU 10, which includes Estes Park, were from harvest samples taken during 2001 to 2003 by the Colorado Division of Wildlife (http://wildlife.state.co.us/CWD/)..

Because this was essentially a case to control study, we used odds ratios rather than relative risk to analyse statistically the association between CWD status and genotype. In these analyses, we used diploid genotypes rather than allele frequencies to avoid artificially inflating sample sizes and potentially biasing estimates of 2 and odds ratio statistics (Agresti, 1996; Sasieni, 1997). We combined genotype 225SF with 225FF due to the low proportion of the latter genotype in our samples (0 2 %). We used 2x2 contingency tables to test whether CWD status (positive or negative) was independent of 225 genotype (PROG FREQ; SAS OnlineDoc 8, SAS Institute). If we failed to reject the null hypothesis, it would conclude that genotype was unrelated to CWD status. We conducted the analysis for all data combined and then for Wyoming and Colorado separately. We did not analyse the data by individual HU or DAU because we lacked sample size at that level and could not meet the assumptions of the 2 analysis..

Of these, only codon 225 [serine (S)/phenylalanine (F)] encoded different amino acids in the mature polypeptide (Fig. 2a). A single base change in codon 20 created a substitution polymorphism (aspartate/glycine) in the amino-terminal signal sequence that is removed during membrane translocation (Bendtsen et al., 2004). Variations in codon 131 (tyrosine1/tyrosine2) and codon 247 (isoleucine1/isoleucine2) did not change the encoded amino acid. At all four loci, one allele was more abundant and one was infrequent [Fig. 2b(iv to v)]. A comparison of the genotypes found in CWD-positive and CWD-negative samples showed only one 225SF among the CWD-positive group. This suggested that the 225F allele might be under-represented in CWD-infected deer, but the low frequency of 225F among all samples (allele frequency 0 033; SF/FF genotype frequency 6 3 %) and the non-random nature of the sample set made these data insufficient to determine if a significant bias existed. We therefore analysed 1119 additional samples from all units in the study area and categorized them according to CWD infection status.

Our data show a large deficit of the 225SF genotype among CWD-infected mule deer in the wild, demonstrating that genotype and CWD infection are strongly associated and also implying a low probability of CWD infection among free-ranging 225SF deer. It cannot be ruled out that this might reflect a low probability of exposure to CWD for 225SF animals due to possible distribution characteristics of mule deer population units in the endemic area such as chance clustering of related 225SF deer away from highly localized infectious sites or animals. The low percentage of 225SF genotypes relative to 225SS genotypes combined with a possibly limited total area actually containing infection sources could also reduce exposure probability. Alternatively, the lower than expected occurrence of 225SF genotypes among free-ranging CWD-infected animals could be due to a lower susceptibility of those deer to natural CWD. Although 225SF deer are fully susceptible to experimental challenge, orally exposed captive mule deer with the SF genotype were slower to develop clinical symptoms of CWD, and neuroinvasion by PrPCWD took place later than in 225SS deer. This SF genotype effect could manifest as slower disease development (lengthened incubation period) in experimental CWD, and as lower probability of infection in the wild, although these may not necessarily be manifestations of the same phenomena. Lengthened survival times and apparently slower disease development have also been observed in experimentally infected elk with PrP codon 132ML and 132LL genotypes (T. J.

Comparable observations are difficult to make for natural infections among free-ranging animals, and a test of the relative susceptibility of 225SF deer to CWD, in the sense of amount of infectious agent required for infection, have not been carried out..

0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	39	Nevertheless, the precedent of genetic factors affecting susceptibility to infectious prion diseases is well-established (Prusiner et al., 2004). The high odds ratios reported here for a possible genetically linked differential susceptibility to CWD in mule deer are consistent with the high degree of influence of genotype reported for scrapie in sheep (Hunter, 1997; Detwiler  and  Baylis, 2003). Some differences between genetics of scrapie in sheep and CWD in cervids are notable: CWD is unique as a TSE that occurs in wild populations subject to genetic drift and natural selection, rather than in selectively bred domestic animals. Also, the number of polymorphic codons in deer and elk PrP [two in mule deer, one in elk and three in white-tailed deer, all dimorphisms (Raymond et al., 2000; Heaton et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2003; O'Rourke et al., 2004)] is low compared with the number of different amino acid positions that vary and the number of alleles that occur at these positions in domestic sheep breeds worldwide (Bossers et al., 2000; Baylis  and  Goldmann, 2004). It should be noted that the odds ratios relating 225 genotype and CWD in mule deer stand in contrast to the low odds ratios previously reported by O'Rourke et al. (2004) for genetic susceptibility to CWD in white-tailed deer based on the three different polymorphisms found in that species..

Increased survival time for infected, asymptomatic animals might increase the period during which infectious agent is shed into the environment, although it should be pointed out that all but one of the 225SF deer in this study were not infected, rather than undergoing an asymptomatic, protracted subclinical phase. The possibility of  dormant infections' or carrier state in TSEs has been raised in connection with scrapie (O'Rourke et al., 1997) and more recently with inapparent vCJD infections in PrP codon 129VM heterozygous humans and 129VV transgenic mice (Carrell, 2004; Wadsworth et al., 2004). Alternatively, slower development of CWD could mean 225SF deer require longer times of infection to reach the shedding stage. This situation could be neutral for transmission in the wild, or it could lead to a decrease in CWD prevalence due to infected deer dying of other causes before becoming infectious. This issue will remain unresolved until we learn when the infectious agent is shed during CWD infections and are able to measure its specific infectivity..

Experimental infection of 225SF deer appears to take place readily at the oral doses typically administered. In addition, we detected one free-ranging infected 225SF deer from Wyoming in our analysis, and subsequent genotyping of 234 additional CWD-positive samples from north-central Colorado revealed five 225SF individuals (M. W. Miller, unpublished data). It is also important to note that 225FF homozygous deer are not resistant, as evidenced by two 225FF deer also found among the additional positive samples genotyped. The 225F allele is present in such low frequencies in the deer herds sampled that free-ranging 225FF deer are not often found in surveys (e.g. only three of the 1482 samples used in this analysis were 225FF), and accurate assessment of their relative susceptibility to CWD will depend on work with animals currently being bred in captivity..

Alternatively, selection against the 225SS genotype by high CWD prevalence could produce areas of both high disease prevalence and high frequency of the SF genotype. On an overall basis we saw no relationship between the proportions of SF animals estimated in HUs and the prevalence of CWD, but it may be necessary to compare proportions of SF and CWD prevalence in the same unit over time to detect such trends. Whether the time scales required for such observations would be feasible is not known. CWD is estimated to have been present in wild cervids for 50 years or more (Miller et al., 2000), so the time over which such effects could have been at work in CWD endemic areas may be too short to show reduced disease prevalence in areas of high SF frequencies. Also, the effect could be small compared with drift or mutation if CWD exerts only a low level of genetic selection because of its normally long incubation period, which allows for continued reproduction or genetic replacement, despite disease status. The fact that we did not observe a relationship may also be due to the scale at which our observations have been made (i.e. HUs), which are large relative to the population units most affected by variations in factors involved in the disease, including genetics (Conner  and  Miller, 2004)..

To address these issues, we have investigated the effects on steady-state gene expression of chronic copper overload in a cell culture model system using cDNA microarrays. For this study we utilized cells from genetic models of copper overload: fibroblast cells from two mouse mutants, C57BL/6-Atp7aMobr and C57BL/6-Atp7aModap. These cell lines accumulate copper to abnormally high levels in normal culture media due to a defect in copper export from the cell. We identified 12 differentially expressed genes in common using our outlier identification methods. Surprisingly, our results show no evidence of oxidative stress in the copper-loaded cells. In addition, candidate components perhaps responsible for a copper-specific homeostatic response are identified.

Acute copper poisoning is not frequent but is usually the consequence of consumption of contaminated foodstuffs or beverages, or from accidental or deliberate ingestion of high quantities of copper salts. Acute copper poisoning is characterized with nausea, vomiting, and gastric pain.

Nutritional studies of chronic copper overload in both mice and rats have shown copper-induced liver damage in these animals (1, 19, 38). In addition, WD, a human genetic disorder of copper overload, is characterized by a gradual hepatic accumulation of copper that eventually results in liver cirrhosis (7). Other copper overload disorders in humans include Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis (ETIC), and idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT). These diseases result in abnormal hepatic copper accumulation and can result in chronic hepatitis and hepatic failure (36). Although the liver injury in each of these cases is copper induced, the mechanisms by which excess copper results in cellular toxicity have not been fully elucidated. The increase in copper levels, especially in WD, occurs over a period of many years, and phenotypic consequences are not reported until copper levels are extremely elevated. The lack of appreciable pathological changes from ever increasing copper levels until late in the disease process suggests that compensatory homeostatic mechanisms must exist..

0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	12	Toxicity resulting from copper overload has long been hypothesized to result from the redox cycling Haber-Weiss reaction in which cuprous ions react with H2O2 to form highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn catalyze the oxidation of biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (reviewed in Refs. 22 and 15). The suspected role of ROS in copper overload is supported by observations of increased generation of lipid peroxidation products, as well as evidence of DNA damage in hepatocytes reacted with ionic copper (6, 59). In vivo studies have shown that markers of lipid peroxidation are increased in mitochondria from livers of WD patients (55). There is also evidence of lipid peroxidation in livers of rats chronically fed very high copper diets (38, 54)..

Most studies that indicate that copper causes oxidative stress have tested very high levels of copper (38, 54). Indeed, a study in which a diet with moderately high levels of copper was fed to rats showed no lipid peroxidation (1). DNA damage, often a consequence of oxidative stress, has been observed in copper overload in vivo, however, only in the cirrhotic livers of WD patients (21). Nevertheless, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with WD is not higher than that in the general population (50). This raises the question of whether copper, at moderately elevated levels, results in oxidative damage, and if not, what effects, if any, these levels have on cells. Clearly, the cellular mechanisms that protect the cell are vigorous, and only at very high levels do they become overwhelmed. We currently have only a limited understanding of the protective systems that operate in cells chronically exposed to copper. Additionally, the limits of homeostatic regulation are not known, making it difficult to define the milder effects of copper excess (3). Currently no early, biologically relevant markers of copper excess exist.

The microarray experiments were carried out four times for each mutant (i.e., 4 arrays for Mobr vs. control, and 4 arrays for Modap vs. control). The four replicates are technical replicates. Several different plates of each cell line were grown simultaneously and then pooled prior to RNA extraction.

The intensity of hybridization values was determined using GenePix Pro 3.0 (Axon) image analysis software for each probe in both channels (Cy5, 695 nm; Cy3, 595 nm). All intensity values are background-subtracted, normalized by median of channel intensity (to account for dye bias), and log (base 2)-transformed. We have recently developed a novel approach to identify differentially expressed genes between the two mRNA samples based on identification of outliers as candidate differentially expressed genes (27). The majority of data points after appropriate normalization lie in the vicinity of the line of equivalence in the scatter plot of log2(Cy5) vs. log2(Cy3) intensity values. Other data points, outliers, lie outside the vicinity of the line of equivalence and are considered to be data points of greatest interest since they correspond to genes having noticeably different hybridization intensity. We apply robust scatter plot smoothers to quantify and take into account the distortion of the data set by heteroscedasticity (if any). We consider outliers from this analysis to represent candidate differentially expressed genes. We assign a confidence (P value) for each outlier by calculating simultaneous prediction confidence intervals. (Please see Ref. 27 for more details on data analysis methods.).

For Northern blot analysis, 10  microg total RNA was electophoresed in a formaldehyde-containing agarose (1%) gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham) by a standard capillary method. For the detection of App mRNA, the membranes were probed with an 896-bp fragment of App cDNA. The primers used to amplify the probe were designed using Primer3 software (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi), and the sequences were as follows (5'-3'): AAGAACTTGCCCAAAGCTGA (forward), GTGATGACAATCACGGTTGC (reverse) (896-bp amplicon). The probe was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by a random priming method (Prime-It II, Stratagene) and hybridized to the membrane at 42 degrees C for 20 h. After hybridization the membranes were washed under stringent conditions and exposed to BioMax film (Kodak) at  to 70 degrees C. Autoradiograms were evaluated by densitometry (AlphaEase, Alpha Innotech)..

Validation of changes in Prnp and App gene expression was carried out by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (sq-RT-PCR). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) was used as a control. The G3pdh primers were obtained from a commercial source (Clontech), and the Prnp primers were designed using Primer3 software. The sequences (5'-3') of the Prnp primers were as follows: GCATTCTGCCTTCCTAGTGG (forward), GAGAATGCGAAGGAACAAGC (reverse) (860-bp amplicon). Primers for App were the same as those used in the Northern blot. Primers for Gcl and Gpx have been described elsewhere (13, 29); they are: for Gcl (427 bp), GATTTGGTCAGGGAGTTTCC (forward) and AATGCAGTCAAATCTGGTGG (reverse); for Gpx (537 bp), GCTCATTGAGAATGTCGCGTC (forward) and GAGTGCAGCCAGTAATCACC (reverse). Three micrograms of total RNA from Mobr, Modap, and control fibroblasts were reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primer (Operon). PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase as directed by the supplier (Takara Shuzo). PCR conditions were chosen such that none of the transcripts analyzed reached a plateau at the end of the amplification protocol and that the two sets of primers used in each reaction did not compete with each other. An amplification cycle, of 95 degrees C for 45 s, 62 degrees C for 45 s, and 72 degrees C for 2 min, was performed in a 100- microl volume. Following 18 to 35 cycles, 5  microl of the reaction was removed, and the product was separated and visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Scanned gel images (ChemiImager 4400, Alpha Innotech) were imported into image analysis software (AlphaEase, Alpha Innotech), and the density of amplified products (in the linear range of the DNA amplification for each product) was calculated; all values were normalized against the G3pdh housekeeping gene control values..

Gene expression in two chronically copper-overloaded fibroblast cell lines (Mobr and Modap) were compared with a control fibroblast cell line (control) using cDNA microarrays containing 10K different genes. We carried out four replicate hybridizations for each comparison. Exploratory data analysis was done to provide an assessment of the quality of the data set (27). Distortions in the data are readily apparent when using these exploratory tools but can be overlooked if not utilized. For example, a multimodal distribution suggests that the data are drawn from several populations that are behaving differently such as data arising from nonhomogenous hybridizations. The results of four exploratory data analysis tools for one of the hybridizations (Modap vs. control) are shown in Fig. 1. The results for the eight individual microarrays can be found in the Supplemental Figs. S1 to S4 (the Supplementary Materials are available online at the Physiological Genomics web site).1 Inspection of the box plots (Fig. 1A) show that scale, location, number of outlying observations, and asymmetry are similar for both channels (Cy5 and Cy3) for this data set. Similarly, the average shifted histograms (Fig. 1B) provide information on the empiric distribution of a random variable and reveal that the data resembles samples from univariate normal distributions for both channels. The QQ normal plot (Fig. 1C) compares the quantiles of the empirical data distribution with the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. The majority of points in QQNP for both channels of our data conform closely to a standard normal distribution except for longer tails. These deviations may be due to random fluctuations and/or systematic variation. Finally, each point on a scatter plot (Fig. 1D) corresponds to one bivariate observation after appropriate normalization and log transformation. These results show that the red and green channel intensities in the data sets are highly correlated having approximately symmetric distributions and are appropriate for further analysis for the determination of candidates for differentially expressed genes..

We identified differentially expressed genes from each hybridization by our outlier identification method (see MATERIALS AND METHODS and Ref. 27). We were interested in those genes that were significantly changed (either up- or downregulated) in the copper-overloaded cells compared with a control. As shown in Fig. 2, the majority of the data points lie in the vicinity of a robust linear regression line of the scatter plot of log2(Cy5) vs. log2(Cy3) intensity values. These data points signify genes with similar transcript behaviors in the two samples, whereas other data points lie outside the scatter plots and correspond to genes having noticeably different hybridization intensity values. We determine statistics log2(Cy5/Cy3)/s(I) to estimate statistical significance (P values) for every gene to be a candidate for differential expression [s(I) is a robust scale estimator dependent on intensity] and use it to build simultaneous prediction intervals for graphical representation that genes outside the intervals are most likely outliers. Robust scatter plot smoothers are used to account for heteroscedasticity (e.g., variation in residual variance with intensity) in each data set. Red outliers on the top of the graph in Fig. 2 represent candidate upregulated genes, whereas the outlying spots of blue color, on the bottom, represent candidate downregulated genes. Individual outlier plots for each data set can be found in the supplementary data (Supplemental Figs. S5 and S6). We considered data outliers with P  <  0.05 as candidate differentially expressed genes. We then compared the candidate genes identified for each experiment and selected genes identified (i.e., outliers with a P  <  0.05) in three or more repeat hybridizations as likely differentially expressed genes. In the Mobr vs. control experiments, there were 101 genes that were upregulated and 80 genes that were downregulated in, at least, three of the four experiments. In the Modap vs. control experiments, there were 115 up- and 25 downregulated genes that were similar in at least three of the four experiments. The lists of genes can be found in the supplementary data (Supplemental Tables S1 to S4).

A surprisingly high number of genes related to cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion were found to be differentially expressed in both the Mobr and the Modap experiments. The majority of these genes were upregulated, but several of them were downregulated. Cell adhesion genes comprise 15% and 16% of the upregulated genes with known functions, in the Modap and Mobr cells, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B, pie slice a). Fifteen percent and 8% of the upregulated genes with known functions, in the Modap and Mobr cells, respectively, are involved in cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis (Fig. 3, A and B, pie slice d).

We investigated two independently derived genetic models of copper overload containing mutations in the same gene to discriminate between cell-specific effects and the effects of copper. Both of these mutations result in severe loss of function in the Atp7a gene (33). Both mutants result in a cellular defect in copper efflux that leads to similar levels of intracellular copper accumulation in cultured cells. These mutant cell lines represent well-characterized models of cellular copper overload (12, 32); thus we expected that genes differentially expressed in both mutant cell lines would likely represent copper-specific changes. We acknowledge that further validation of any potential biomarkers would be needed to confirm their utility as biomarkers of chronic copper overload of other etiologies.

0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	59	An investigation into the functions of the differentially expressed genes led us to some surprising results. Copper is thought to be toxic if allowed to accumulate in excess of cellular needs because of its ability to generate free radicals (6). Indeed, there are reports of copper-induced oxidative damage at high doses of exposure (55). Hence, we expected that many of the differentially expressed genes would be those that encoded proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress. Surprisingly, both mottled cell lines, despite being chronically copper overloaded, show no differential expression of oxidative stress genes besides the upregulation of MT1. MT1, long known to be induced by copper (and other heavy metals) and to be elevated in the cultured fibroblasts (and other nonhepatic cell lines) from both Menkes patients (25, 49) and mottled mice (41), was upregulated in the Mobr cells, (it was not on the array and, therefore, not assayed in the Modap cells). In contrast, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), one of the main intracellular antioxidants, and -glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL), a regulator of glutathione synthesis, which previously has been shown to be upregulated under oxidative stress (13, 35), were not induced in either of the two cell lines. In support of our findings is a recent study that showed that fibroblasts from Menkes patients, despite having intracellular copper levels five times that of control cells, had decreased basal oxidative stress and a more efficient protection toward free radicals than fibroblasts from controls (18). Their results, which included measurements of redox metal content, antioxidant equipment, and oxidative stress markers, showed that the activity of catalase and GPX, TBARS (a marker of lipid peroxidation), and the production of hydrogen peroxide were all decreased in the Menkes (MNK) cells. Metallothionein production was also increased in the MNK cells. Together, these data suggest that chronic exposure to moderately elevated intracellular levels of copper does not induce oxidative damage to cells; instead, we observe evidence of an adaptive response to copper..

0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	61	A large number of differentially expressed genes in both the Mobr and Modap cell lines are involved in cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion (Table 2). The relationship between cytoskeletal organization and copper metabolism is not known. It is possible that copper may be affecting the cytoskeleton directly. Polymerization/depolymerization of actin and tubulin is regulated in part by divalent metal-ion-binding sites, generally for Ca2+ and Mg2+; thus other divalent metals may act as potential toxic interferers (58). Whether copper or other metal ions actually compete with or displace Ca2+ or Mg2+ in the cytoskeleton is not known, but there is evidence that zinc, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium can disrupt actin and microtubules in intact cells (58). Another possible explanation of the expression changes could be an indirect effect secondary to lysyl oxidase (LO) deficiency. LO is a copper-containing protein that is responsible for the formation of lysine-derived cross-links in connective tissue, particularly in collagen and elastin (52). LO activity has been shown to be decreased in fibroblasts from patients with Menkes disease (17, 51). Hence, alterations in the extracellular matrix could have a downstream effect on the cytoskeleton and lead to the observed changes in gene expression. Additionally, amyloid precursor protein, induced in our models of copper overload and whose function is still undetermined, has been shown to interact with collagen, sharing common binding sites with heparin, and has been proposed to be a mediator of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions (56). The changes we observed could also be due to changes in function of this protein. Furthermore, defects in the trafficking of the ATP7A protein may be leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization. Normally, the ATP7A protein traffics between the TGN and the plasma membrane and is vesicle mediated (45, 42). The molecular mechanisms responsible for membrane trafficking of ATP7A have recently been under extensive investigation and may involve cytoskeletal factors that have yet to be identified..

The identification of copper binding sites on both of these proteins suggests a possible role in copper homeostasis (61). APP is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and, although the function is unknown, is likely to play an important role in normal cell physiology. APP contains two copper-binding sites and is able to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) in vitro (37). APP is the precursor of the ss-amyloid (Ass) peptide, which constitutes the characteristic amyloid plaques of AD. The homeostasis of copper is significantly altered in the AD brain (57). Copper inhibits ss-amyloid production by stimulating the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP (5); however, in vitro, copper induces aggregation of the soluble amyloid peptide, suggesting a role in both the processing of APP and amyloid plaque assembly and may contribute to AD development (24).

PAH2 has been shown to interact strongly with the Sin3 interacting domain (SID) of the tumor suppressor Mad. This PAH2/Mad complex has been studied extensively by NMR, but the molecular determinants that dictate the specificity of interaction remain to be elucidated. To uncover residues that convey the specificity of interaction between PAH2 and Mad, PAH2 residues contacted by the Mad-SID were introduced into the PAH1 domain of mSin3b and tested for gain-of-interaction in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid setting and further confirmed in a cell-free system. This approach led to the identification of PAH2-Phe-7 as a critical residue. Stabilization of the interaction between PAH1-Phe-7 and the Mad-SID was achieved by introducing Val-14 and Gln-39 into PAH1. Substitution of PAH2 residues contacted by the Mad-SID with their respective residues in PAH1 corroborated and extended the critical role of Phe-7 and the stabilizing role of Val-14 and Gln-39. We conclude that Phe-7 is the critical determinant and provides the molecular specificity for the association between Sin3 and Mad in regulating cell growth and differentiation..

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The ordered and specific/selective recruitment of multiprotein complexes with intrinsic chromatin remodelling or histone modifying activities to cis-acting DNA elements has emerged over the last decade as one of the major mechanisms to regulate transcription and cell fate determination (1). A plethora of studies have collectively shown that acetylation of specific N-terminal lysine residues of core histone tails by histone acetyl transferases (HATs)1 creates a chromatin state which results in transcriptional activation (2). Removal of the acetyl moiety by histone deacetylases (HDACs) restores the compact state of chromatin, resulting in transcriptional repression. One of the players in this mechanism is the evolutionary highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed co-repressor Sin3. Sin3 acts as a scaffold protein in many complexes and presumably contributes to repression of transcription by interacting with human class 1 or class 2 histone deacetylases, HDAC1 or HDAC2, or the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog Rpd3 (3-9). Purification of Sin3-containing complexes has revealed a core complex containing HDAC1/2, the pocket binding protein RBP1, Sds3, the histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, and accessory proteins such as SAP30 and SAP130 (9-13)..

These include: Pf1, TIEG2, Opi1, Mnt, Mad family members, and S. cerevisiae Ume6 (6, 14-23). The interaction between Mad and Sin3 is of great interest as it targets deacetylation and repression of transcription to genes required for proliferation of cells. Mad belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein family and is part of the Myc/Mad/Max network. The tumor suppressor Mad and the proto-oncogene Myc independently heterodimerizes with Max to form complexes capable of targeting the hexanucleotide core sequences 5'-CACGTG-3' enhancer box present on specific promoters such as cyclin D2, htert, and Id2 (24-29). The Myc/Max heterodimer can recruit the TRRAP/GCN5 complex containing HAT activity in proliferating cells, as opposed to the Mad/Max heterodimer, which recruits the Sin3 complex triggering deacetylation of histones in differentiation (30-32)..

So far, PAH3 has been shown to interact with SAP30. Recently glycosylation was linked to transcriptional repression by showing interaction between PAH4 and O-Glc-NAc transferase (35). A minimal conserved binding motif consisting of the N terminus residue 8-20 of Mad1 was established to interact strongly to PAH2 (36). The interaction between the PAH2 domain of Sin3 with the SID of Mad has been characterized in detail by NMR. PAH2 folds as a wedged four-helix bundle structure that is stabilized upon complex formation with the Mad-SID, which adopts an amphipathic -helix (37, 38). Although the four domains have a high degree of homology, they seem to interact with distinct subsets of factors. Structural prerequisites of PAH interactors for a stable interaction with a PAH domain seem to be -helicity and amphipathicity, but the structural studies do not shed light on the role of individual residues in binding and specificity..

Incubating equal amounts of GST-PAH1 and GST-PAH2 with decreasing amounts of ProtG-Mad, i.e. creating a competitive setting, indicated that Mad-SID binds preferentially to PAH2 in vitro. To ascertain this differential interaction in vivo, we performed yeast two-hybrid experiments. The PAH1 and PAH2 domains of msin3b were fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (G4DBD) and used as baits. As a prey, a constrained Mad-SID displayed in the active-site loop of E. coli thioredoxin (TRX) molecule was used, fused to the gal4 activation domain (G4ADTRX-Mad). PAH2 expression in combination with Mad resulted in a robust -galactosidase level, whereas PAH1 yielded background levels (Fig. 1C). This activation mediated by G4DBDPAH2 was strictly dependent upon the presence of the Mad-SID, as TRX alone resulted in background levels.

This revealed Glu-6, Phe-7, Ile-11, Val-14, Asn-15, Ile-17, Arg-29, Leu-35, His-36, and Gln-39 as potential selective modifiers. Therefore, we performed a systematic mutational analysis, replacing the respective PAH1 residues with the potentially selective PAH2 residues. Each mutant was then fused to the G4DBD and tested in the yeast two-hybrid setting..

To identify additional residues, a second cycle of single amino acid substitutions was performed this time in the context of M35L. Some combinations, such as K36H with M35L, yielded reduced levels, whereas others seemed neutral. A significant enhancement of the interaction was observed with the double mutant containing V7F (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, two-hybrid assays performed in the absence of Mad or in the absence of a prey showed that PAH1-M35L had gained intrinsic transcriptional activity. On top of this, intrinsic transcriptional activity displayed by PAH1-M35L, the double-mutant PAH1-V7F/M35L yielded a significantly higher -galactosidase level that was dependent upon the presence of the Mad-SID. Apparently, the intrinsic activity of PAH1-M35L had elevated the overall activity into a measurable range, thereby facilitating detection of the V7F effect in the yeast two-hybrid assays. As observed in Fig. 3A, the interaction of PAH1-V7F with Mad-SID was not sufficient to boost -galactosidase levels above background..

Combining PAH1-V7F with L14V and, to a lesser extent, K39Q, significantly boosted -galactosidase levels, whereas all other combinations remained at background levels (Fig. 3, C and E). Control experiments showed that the -galactosidase level was strictly dependent upon the presence of Mad-SID. To test whether the affinity of the mutated PAH1 for the Mad-SID could be further improved, third-site mutations were introduced, this time in the context of PAH1-V7F/L14V (Fig. 3, D and E). As expected from the second screen, K39Q increased the -galactosidase level (L11I and K36H showed modest effects). Interaction of PAH1-V7F/L14V/K39Q with Mad yielded -galactosidase activity up to 30% of that obtained with PAH2 and Mad in this yeast two-hybrid setting. Remarkably, PAH1-L14V/K39Q yielded background levels of -galactosidase, thus reinforcing the critical role of Phe-7 and suggesting that Val-14 and Gln-39 contribute to the strength of the interaction, but do not represent the strongest determinants..

Strikingly, PAH2-F7V completely abolished the interaction with Mad-SID, further substantiating its critical role (Fig. 4). Single mutations of V14L and Q39K displayed only a reduced but appreciable level of interaction between PAH2 and Mad (17.49 and 8.71%, respectively, of PAH2/Mad wild-type activity). Remarkably, the double-mutant PAH2-V14L/Q39K still supported a low level but substantial interaction. When tested in the context of F7V, the V14L or K39Q alone or combined remained at a background level.

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	40	  Structural Determinants of the Mad-SID: Constraints versus Helical Propensity In our assays, the Mad-SID was conformationally constrained by insertion into the surface loop of the TRX that is between two cysteines. In its native context, Mad-SID is located at the N terminus of Mad and can freely adopt any structure. Therefore, we evaluated the interaction properties of the PAH domains with the Mad-SID when displayed in a more flexible environment. To achieve this, a stop codon was inserted downstream of the Mad sequence before the second cysteine, thus creating a C terminus. In this C-terminal, "flexible" context, Mad-SID strongly interacted with PAH2 but not detectably with PAH1, and hence the specificity of interaction was not altered in this context (Fig. 5A). The single-mutants PAH1-L14V and PAH1-K39Q remained at background levels (Fig. 5B), whereas a modest but reproducible interaction was obtained with PAH1-V7F. This modest gain of interaction is probably due to unleashing free helical properties. Similarly, the double-mutants PAH1-V7F/L14V and V7F/K39Q displayed a 3-fold higher activity, as compared with the constrained context. The PAH1-L14V/K39Q, lacking the critical V7F, remained at background level. The flexible triple mutant displayed roughly equal -galactosidase activity (to 30%) as compared with the constrained version. These results show that free helicity plays an important role in establishing an interaction with Mad, but without a phenylalanine at position 7, unleashing of free helical properties is insufficient to support an interaction..

PAH1 and PAH2 mutants were fused to GST, purified, and incubated with fixed amounts of immobilized ProtG-Mad bound to IgG-Sepharose beads (Fig. 5D). In the context of PAH1, Phe-7 partially facilitated binding to Mad-SID, which was further enhanced with the inclusion of Val-14 and/or Gln-39. Val-14 in the context of PAH1 displayed some binding to the Mad-SID, whereas Gln-39 was unable to support an interaction. Overall, the in vitro data show that Phe-7 is the residue that contributes most for binding, followed by Val-14 and Gln-39. In the reverse situation, mutation in PAH2 of Phe-7 abolished the interaction in vitro, as observed in the yeast two-hybrid setting. Mutating Gln-39 in PAH2 slightly affected the interaction, whereas no effect could be observed when Val-14 was mutated. Combining Phe-7 and Gln-39 mutations yielded background levels as observed in vivo. Mutations combining Phe-7 and Val-14 in PAH2 resulted in a substantial interaction, whereas no effect could be observed from combining Val-14 and Gln-39.

Primary cultures of murine Prnp-/- brain cells were more sensitive to CVBs than corresponding cells from wild-type mice. The viral susceptibility of a Prnp-null cell line (HpL3-4) derived from the murine hippocampus was compared with that of two established cell lines (HeLa and HEp-2) that are widely employed for CVB3 studies. After infection with CVB3, HpL3-4 cells showed a very rapid and complete cytopathic effect (CPE). CPE developed earlier and viruses replicated at higher titres in HpL3-4 cells compared with HeLa and HEp-2 cells. Under a semi-solid medium, plaques developed rapidly in CVB3-infected HpL3-4 cells. To confirm the effect of Prnp on virus infection, a Prnp-/- cell line and a Prnp-transfected neuronal cell line were analysed. The replication and release of infectious particles of CVB3 in Prnp-/- cells were significantly more effective than those of the Prnp-transfected cell line. Levels of type I interferon (IFN) after CVB3 infection were higher in the Prnp-transfected cell line than in Prnp-/- cells, whereas apoptotic cells were more obvious in the Prnp-/- cells than in those of the Prnp-transfected cell line. These findings suggest that the absence of Prnp retards the induction of CVB3-induced IFNs, resulting in an enhanced CVB3 production and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, our data indicate that the HpL3-4 cell line may provide a novel and sensitive system for isolation of CVB3 from clinical specimens..

0.25954077.14645931.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrPC, is encoded by a single gene corresponding to about 250 amino acids and is highly conserved among vertebrates (Prusiner et al., 1998; Zanusso et al., 1998). PrPC is expressed in neurons and glia of the brain and spinal cord, as well as in several peripheral tissues and leukocytes. PrPC mRNA can first be detected in the brains of mice and chickens in early embryogenesis and its level increases with development (Harris et al., 1993; Manson et al., 1992). In the adult central nervous systems (CNS), PrPC and its mRNA are widely distributed, with particularly high concentrations in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells and spinal motor neurons (DeArmond et al., 1987; Kretzschmar et al., 1986). Although the PrPC localization on the cell surface may be consistent with roles in adhesion and recognition, ligand uptake or transmembrane signalling, its function remains to be defined..

A recent report shows that murine leukaemia virus replication accelerates the infectious process of scrapie (Carp et al., 1999), suggesting possible in vivo interactions between viruses and PrP. These findings prompted us to analyse the effects of PrP expression on virus replication in CNS cells..

Most CVB infections are asymptomatic, but different organs may be affected (e.g. myocardium, pancreas, CNS). Some acute and persistent infections are especially severe in infants (Woodruff, 1980). Despite the accumulation of virological and molecular data, the mechanisms of acute and chronic tissue damage induced by CVBs are not well understood..

0.25954077.14645931.html.plaintext.txt	10	Two observations prompted us to investigate the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in CNS cells: (i) CVBs are known to have affinity for newborn tissues and may cause encephalomyelitis in infants (Woodruff, 1980); and (ii) PrPC displays RNA-binding and chaperoning properties that may influence virus replication and assembly (Gabus et al., 2001). Since CVB3 replication occurred more rapidly in primary cell cultures derived from prion protein gene (Prnp)-deficient (Prnp-/-) mice than from Prnp+/+ animals, we investigated whether PrPC expression would influence the susceptibility to CVB3 infection. Here we report that an established Prnp-/- hippocampal cell line is more susceptible to CVB3 infection than two human cell lines (HeLa and HEp-2) commonly used for the detection and titration of these agents. Furthermore, the role of PrPC in CVB3 resistance was studied following the reintroduction of Prnp into a Prnp-/- cell line..

The neonatal mouse brain is one of the most susceptible organs to CVB3 infection. Several studies have shown that CVB can induce severe infections in the CNS of newborns (Rotbart, 1995; Xu  and  Crowell, 1996). In this study, we observed that CVB3 infection of primary cultures of brain cells from Prnp-/- mice was followed by a rapid and intense development of CPE. The expression of MCAR is known to play a major role in the cellular tropism of CVB3 (Selinka et al., 1998). MCAR transcripts have been detected at high levels in cells cultured from the neonatal murine brain. In primary cultures of murine Prnp-/- brain cells, the expression level of MCAR appeared to decrease with age (data not shown). Considering these in vivo data, it was expected that primary brain cells from newborn mice would be highly susceptible to CVB3. Recently, PrP has been demonstrated to have RNA-binding properties analogous to those of certain retrovirus gene products (Darlix et al., 1995). The difference in CVB3 susceptibility between the Prnp-/- cells and wild-type cells indicates a possible relationship between PrP expression and susceptibility to virus infection in neurons. In the present experiments, PrP-deficient HpL3-4 cells were more susceptible to CVB3-induced CPE and produced higher virus titres than the HeLa and HEp-2 cell lines used for comparison. Similarly, this susceptibility and high level of virus production were also observed in an assay using VSV (data not shown). HpL3-4 cells were also able to form plaques after CVB3 infection. Comparative studies with Prnp+/+ cells indicate that viral susceptibility of the HpL3-4 cell line not only reflects the high-level expression of MCAR (a feature common to all neuronal cell types investigated so far) but also the lack of the PrP gene product. Although further studies are warranted to define the relationship between PrP and susceptibility to CVB3, the described Prnp-/- cell line may represent a useful tool for detecting and titrating these agents in human and animal samples..

Although genetic variations affect short-term memory in humans, it is unknown whether genetic variability has also an impact on long-term memory. Because prion-like conformational changes may be involved in the induction of long-lasting synaptic plasticity, we examined the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the prion protein gene (PRNP) on long-term memory in healthy young humans. SNPs in the genomic region of PRNP were associated with better long-term memory performance in two independent populations with different educational background. Among the examined PRNP SNPs, the common Met129Val polymorphism yielded the highest effect size. Twenty-four hours after a word list-learning task, carriers of either the 129MM or the 129MV genotype recalled 17% more information than 129VV carriers, but short-term memory was unaffected. These results suggest a role for the prion protein in the formation of long-term memory in humans..

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	10	In contrast to short-term memory, long-term memory (i.e. the ability to retain information for several hours, days and even years) depends on de novo protein synthesis and on long-term changes in the molecular components of the neuronal synapse (5). However, little is known about the cell biology and molecular mechanisms that initiate and maintain these structural changes. Recent experiments in yeast and Aplysia suggest that a prion-like protein switch might help to maintain long-term synaptic changes required for the formation of long-term memory. Specifically, it has been shown that a neuronal isoform of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates local protein synthesis and stabilizes synapse-specific long-term facilitation in Aplysia (6). In addition, Aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties when expressed in yeast and it is the self-perpetuating prion-like form of CPEB that has the capacity to activate translationally dormant mRNA (7). These studies led to the radically new notion that prion-like conformational changes may be a key event for the maintenance of structural synaptic changes underlying long-term memory. If the conversion of proteins into a self-perpetuating state represents a mechanism for long-term memory storage, genes encoding proteins with prion-like properties are excellent candidates for association with human long-term memory capacity..
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	11	In humans, the only protein with well-characterized prion properties is the prion protein PrP, encoded by the PRNP gene on the short arm of chromosome 20. PRNP is polymorphic with intronic, 5'- and 3'-UTR SNPs as well as a common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 (M129V), which modulates the folding behavior of the protein (8,9) and controls susceptibility to prion diseases (10). Human genetic variation is often organized into population-specific haplotype blocks, i.e. areas of the genome with substantial correlations among neighboring alleles (11). In populations of Caucasian origin, genetic variability of PRNP is represented by a haplotype block spanning 25 kb including the M129V SNP (www.celera.com). On the basis of the recent experimental observations related to the mechanisms of long-term memory formation (6,7), we hypothesized that human genetic variability of PRNP might be related to long-term memory and, therefore, investigated the influence of polymorphic sites within PRNP on memory capacity in 354 healthy young subjects (Table 1)..

Demographic and behavioral data of the study population      RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Influence of PRNP SNPs on human long-term memory All investigated SNPs in the genomic region of PRNP (n=3) were significantly associated with long-term memory performance (free recall 24 h after learning; logistic regression analysis) (Fig. 1), whereas none was associated with short-term memory (free recall immediately or 5 min after learning). The M129V polymorphism displayed the highest level of significance (P=0.001, Fig. 1 and Table 2). To improve the estimation of the type I statistical error, we performed permutation analysis and used Monte Carlo simulations in addition to the logistic regression analysis. The association remained significant both after 50 000 permutations and Monte Carlo simulations (100 000 random samplings; P=0.006 for both methods). Although the three PRNP SNPs were tightly linked [For multi-locus linkage disequilibrium (LD) P0.00001], extended haplotype analysis did not increase the significance. In addition, the 5'-UTR SNPs failed to show any association with long-term memory performance when statistically controlled for the effect of the M129V polymorphism. Conversely, the significant effect of the M129V polymorphism was not affected when controlled for the 5'-UTR SNPs. Therefore, we conclude that the M129V polymorphism accounted fully for the association of the PRNP region with long-term memory. The significant effect of the M129V polymorphism on long-term memory performance was present in both the academic group (n=240; P=0.006) and the non-academic group (n=114; P=0.05; Table 2). Analysis of covariance showed that subjects homozygous or heterozygous for the 129M variant exhibited 17% better memory performance in the 24 h recall than valine homozygotes (Fig. 2, Tables 3 and 4). Importantly, values for 24 h recall performance in each of the genotype strata were normally distributed (P > 0.1). Forward and backward logistic regression analyses in the entire sample revealed that, besides the M129V polymorphism, 5 min delayed recall performance and gender significantly influenced long-term memory performance (Table 2). Exclusion of these covariates from the regression model did not influence the effect of the M129V polymorphism on long-term memory. Importantly, immediate and 5 min delayed recall were not affected by the M129V polymorphism (Table 3), indicating that the genotype-dependent differences in 24 h recall are unlikely to be caused by confounding factors such as motivation or attention..

Influence of PRNP and adjacent polymorphisms on long-term memory (24 h free recall of words) in the entire sample and the two subsamples   Exclusion of nearby genomic loci Next, we investigated whether the observed association of the M129V SNP with long-term memory was due to linkage disequilibrium with a nearby genetic variation. In the 3' flanking region of PRNP, we analyzed the T174M substitution of the PRND gene, which is located 25 kb 3' to the M129V SNP and encodes the PrP homologue doppel (Fig. 1). Twenty five kilobases 5' to the M129V SNP we analyzed SNP rs1029273 which has been previously shown to confer susceptibility for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) independently of the M129V polymorphism (12). Consistent with existing data in the populations of Caucasian origin (www.celera.com), the three PRNP SNPs and the 5'-flanking SNP rs1029273 were part of a haplotype block in our study population (multi-allelic D'=0.82, P < 0.000001) with the PRNP SNPs exerting the highest LD values. The T174M SNP of PRND was not part of the haplotype (D'=0.05, P=0.4). Of note, none of the examined SNPs deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P0.2). Neither T174M nor rs102973 showed significant association with long-term memory performance (Fig. 1 and Table 3). Therefore, we conclude that the codon 129 polymorphism fully accounts for the association between the PRNP locus and long-term memory..
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	19	Exclusion of non-random genetic heterogeneity Association studies in outbred populations such as the present one may be prone to false-positivity because non-random genetic heterogeneity within the study sample (i.e. population structure) can lead to spurious associations between a candidate marker and a phenotype (13). Therefore, we calculated the structure of genetic heterogeneity in our study population by genotyping each subject for 318 SNPs located in both genic and non-genic regions and distributed over all autosomes. Structured association analysis (14) revealed a low allele-frequency divergence in our population (Kullback-Leibler distance=0.23). The individual genetic background values were normally distributed (P=0.6, Fig. 3). Ten subjects were identified as outliers (i.e. beyond the 25 or 75% limits of the normal distribution curve). Importantly, our findings remained unchanged after exclusion of these subjects from the statistical analyses. In addition, we included each subject's genetic background value as a covariate in each analysis. Again, the results remained unchanged. Therefore, we conclude that the significant association of the M129V SNP with long-term memory is independent of the observed genetic heterogeneity levels of our population..

In humans, but not in any other mammalian species (16), PRNP displays the common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129. Approximately 40% of our population was heterozygous for this polymorphism, which is in line with reports in middle European populations (17). However, 129MM and 129VV homozygotes are heavily over-represented in sporadic CJD and iatrogenic CJD (10). In addition, all victims of variant CJD, which is thought to result from infection with bovine prions, were found to be 129MM homozygotes (18). Therefore, 129MV heterozygosity appears to be protective against prion infection (10,19). We observed that the methionine allele correlated dominantly with better long-term memory, because we were unable to discern any difference between the 129MM and the 129MV subgroups. Therefore, the association of the PRNP locus with human long-term memory seems to be unrelated to the susceptibility for prion diseases..

Also, the Sup35 translational termination factor may act as a useful evolutionary buffer for infected yeast (23). Finally, the CPEB protein which is involved in the maintenance of long-term synaptic changes (6) has been shown to possess prion-like properties when expressed in yeast (7).

This population consisted of two independently recruited and tested groups of 240 university students and 114 non-academic employees/trainees (Table 1). After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained. The ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland approved the study protocol..

On the first day, subjects viewed six series of five semantically unrelated nouns presented at a rate of one word per second with the instruction to learn the words for immediate free recall after each series. In addition, subjects underwent an unexpected delayed free-recall test of the learned words after 5 min and again after 24 h. Both delayed recall tests reflect episodic memory (25). In contrast to the 5 min recall, the 24 h recall additionally requires long-term synaptic changes (5). To control for type I statistical error and for effects of educational level on memory, we recruited two independent populations of either university students (academic group) or non-academic employees/trainees (non-academic group)..

Here we report additional novel fish genes found in public databases, including a duplicated SPRN gene, SPRNB, in Fugu, Tetraodon, carp, and zebrafish encoding the Sho2 protein, and we use comparative genomic analysis to analyze the evolutionary relationships and to infer evolutionary trajectories of the complete data set. Phylogenetic footprinting performed on aligned human, mouse, and Fugu SPRN genes to define candidate regulatory promoter regions, detected 16 conserved motifs, three of which are known transcription factor to binding sites for a receptor and transcription factors specific to or associated with expression in brain. This result and other homology-based (VISTA global genomic alignment; protein sequence alignment and phylogenetics) and context-dependent (genomic context; relative gene order and orientation) criteria indicate fish and mammalian SPRN genes are orthologous and suggest a strongly conserved basic function in brain. Whereas tetrapod PRNPs share context with the analogous stPrP-2 to coding gene in fish, their sequences are diverged, suggesting that the tetrapod and fish genes are likely to have significantly different functions. Phylogenetic analysis predicts the SPRN/SPRNB duplication occurred before divergence of fish from tetrapods, whereas that of stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 occurred in fish. Whereas Sho appears to have a conserved function in vertebrate brain, PrP seems to have an adaptive role fine-tuned in a lineage-specific fashion. An evolutionary model consistent with our findings and literature knowledge is proposed that has an ancestral prevertebrate SPRN-like gene leading to all vertebrate PrP-related and Sho-related genes.

Physiologically, PrP exhibits environment-dependent conformational flexibility, with one isoform, PrPC, undergoing refolding into a compact, amyloidogenic isoform, PrPSc, during prion disease pathogenesis. Both isoforms are encoded by the same PRNP gene. PrP mutations determine disposition or resistance to human familial and infectious forms of prion diseases and determine their phenotype in human, mouse, and sheep (Prusiner and Scott 1997). The normal functions of PrPs are still unknown, although evidence for a bewildering number of functions, often contradictory, has been presented (Aguzzi and Hardt 2003)..

First, all these proteins are extracellular and predicted to be GPI-anchored and, with the exception of the most divergent PrP-like proteins, are also actually or potentially N-glycosylated. In addition, PrPs and stPrPs do, or can be predicted to, contain a disulfide bond. Next, all mature proteins have basic regions and, except for frog PrP, repeats. The most characteristic feature of all PrPs and fish proteins related to PrP is a middle stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, which in mammals is essential for the pathogenic PrP isotype conversion (Prusiner 1998). Sho protein shares with these PrPs this unique property of a middle non to membrane-spanning hydrophobic region (fig. 1). In contrast, the Dpl sequence lacks both repeat and hydrophobic regions and shows homology only to the C-terminal folded domain of PrP..

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	20	Genes in different species defined as orthologous by their derivation from a common ancestor generally lie in the same genomic context and perform the same function; this property is the basis for prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes (O'Brien et al. 1999; Waterston et al. 2002). Although this comparative genomics approach is a powerful tool for understanding biological function, the appropriate evolutionary distance of species in a comparison depends on the biological question addressed (Frazer et al. 2003). For example, a comparative study of custom-sequenced genomic data for four yeast species that diverged 5 to 20 MYA allowed a complete analysis for gene identification, determination of gene structures, estimate of rapid/slow evolutionary changes, detection of regulatory elements, detection of combinatorial control of expression, and identification of the key regulatory elements determining gene activity (Kellis et al. 2003). However, there are limitations in the depth and extent of possible mammalian comparative genomic analysis, which parallel availability of eutherian, marsupial, and monotreme lineage representatives (O'Brien, Eizirik, and Murphy 2001; Graves and Westerman 2002). The most comprehensive targeted comparative genomic analysis reported to date included 13 vertebrate species (one human, eight other mammals, one bird, and three fish) and allowed identification of conserved coding and noncoding sequences as well as insight into the genome dynamics (Thomas et al. 2003)..

This analysis comprises both homology and nonhomology criteria for assessing gene orthology (Eisen and Wu 2002). Apart from identification of gene similarity (homology criteria), we tested whether homologous rearrangement events have occurred in the intergenic regions (nonhomology criteria). Conserved order and transcription orientation with respect to adjacent gene or genes, also dubbed "conserved contiguity," implies that there has been no rearrangement in the intergenic regions and that the genes share common evolutionary history. This is suggested to be a strong indication of orthology (Comparative Genome Organization Workshop 1996; Gilligan, Brenner, and Venkatesh 2002)..

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	23	Our analysis is based on sequence data available in public databases. Apart from human, only two vertebrate genome sequences are available in draft form: those for mouse (Waterston et al. 2002) and tiger pufferfish Fugu rubripes (Aparicio et al. 2002). Substantial data for the rat genome is also available (http://www.ensembl.org/Rattus_norvegicus/). Rodents are separated from human by 75 Myr of independent evolution, and mouse and rat (separated by 30 Myr) are the major mammalian models for genetic and immunological research and physiological research, respectively. Data from the recently reported dog genome, which is at only 1.5x sequence coverage (Kirkness et al. 2003), is not yet available in searchable form. Fish are at the root of vertebrate diversification, and extant fish are separated from mammals by 450 Myr of independent evolution. The compact vertebrate genome of Fugu rubripes was proposed as a tool for discovery of vertebrate genes and their regulatory elements (Brenner et al. 1993), and, indeed, its draft genome sequence showed significant conservation of protein-coding genes, intron-exon structures, and gene arrangement with human (Aparicio et al. 2002). Partial genomic sequence information is also available for green pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/), which diverged from Fugu 20 to 30 MYA, and also for zebrafish Danio rerio (http://www.ensembl.org/), which diverged 100 to 150 MYA from pufferfish and is a popular experimental model in developmental studies. The availability of genome information has led to increased recent interest in zebrafish as a model system for human disease (Ward and Lieschke 2002)..

The compact vertebrate genome of Fugu rubripes was proposed as a tool for discovery of vertebrate genes and their regulatory elements (Brenner et al. 1993), and, indeed, its draft genome sequence showed significant conservation of protein-coding genes, intron-exon structures, and gene arrangement with human (Aparicio et al. 2002). Partial genomic sequence information is also available for green pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/), which diverged from Fugu 20 to 30 MYA, and also for zebrafish Danio rerio (http://www.ensembl.org/), which diverged 100 to 150 MYA from pufferfish and is a popular experimental model in developmental studies. The availability of genome information has led to increased recent interest in zebrafish as a model system for human disease (Ward and Lieschke 2002)..

We provide detailed descriptions of the mammalian PRNP, PRND, PRNT, and SPRN genes, and performed "phylogenetic footprinting" on the aligned human, mouse, and Fugu SPRN genes to define possible regulatory regions and transcription factor to binding sites. We present evidence for novel fish genes related to PrP that we identified in public databases: stPrP-2 from Tetraodon and stPrP-3 from zebrafish. We derived the SPRN sequence coding for Sho experimentally from Tetraodon, and for Fugu, Tetraodon, carp, and zebrafish, we found in silico a duplicated SPRN gene (SPRNB) encoding the related Shadoo2 protein (Sho2). We have assessed orthology of the mammalian PRNP and fish genes related to PrP and the mammalian SPRN and homologous fish genes, respectively, and have inferred evolutionary patterns for the mammalian PRNP and SPRN genes. We have developed an evolutionary model consistent with our various findings, as well as information available in the literature, and propose it as a framework for investigating gaps in knowledge in these genes, particularly in fish and tetrapod lineages..

(2003). By using its terminal 200-bp sequence as search query and the BlastN program on the Web service, we identified overlapping clone FS_CONTIG_31029_1. Using the same strategy, the next overlapping clone FS_CONTIG_37429_1 was identified. These sequences were assembled into a virtual contig of 19,029 bp (Tetraodon virtual contig 2; we used a 10-kb sequence containing the SPRN gene from this virtual contig in further analyses). We verified this assembly by using the PiPMaker program to align it to the orthologous Fugu genomic sequence and annotated it by using the NIX interactive Web tool. As the low quality of the FS_CONTIG_4144_1 sequence does not allow translation of the Sho ORF, we used its sequence to design primers (5'-CTAAGACATCCGCCATGACACG-3' and 5'-AGCATCTGCTGCACATCCACAC-3') flanking the Sho ORF, using the MacVector version 7.0 program (Oxford Molecular Group 2000). DNA was extracted from Tetraodon cells using standard procedures (Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis 1989) and used as the template for PCR amplification using FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche) according to the PCR procedure using GC-RICH solution. The PCR product was cloned using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). The cloned fragment was sequenced by using universal primers M13 forward and M13 reverse and the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).

In the first experiment, we aligned human (chr20: 4,558,866 to 4,938,939 bp), mouse (chr2: 132,862,228 to 133,103,751 bp), rat (chr3: 112,821,949 to 113,040,637 bp), Fugu (chr_scaffold_155: 247,572 to 271,811 bp), and Tetraodon (Tetraodon virtual contig 1 [see above]) genomic sequences containing either the PRNP or the stPrP-2 gene, its whole upstream intergenic sequence, and adjacent genes (gene for PrP-like protein in fishes, PRND in mammals, PRNT in human, and RASSF2 and SLC23A1 in both mammals and fishes). In the second experiment, we aligned human (chr10: 134,322,741 to 134,374,165 bp), mouse (chr7: 130,335,510 to 130,371,625 bp), rat (chr1: 199,669,758 to 199,704,156 bp), zebrafish (assembly_203: 4,494,411 to 4,519,077 bp), Fugu (chr_scaffold_28: 384,496 to 394,338 bp), and Tetraodon (Tetraodon virtual contig 2 [see above]) genomic sequences containing the SPRN gene, its whole upstream intergenic region, and adjacent genes (gene encoding GTP-binding protein in all species, amine oxidase (AO) to coding gene in mammals and pufferfish, and long-chain fatty-acyl elongase to coding gene in zebrafish). Before submission to VISTA, transposable elements in the mammalian sequences were masked by using RepeatMasker as above. Human sequence and its annotation were always used as the base sequence. Pairwise sequence comparisons were calculated with a threshold of 50% identity in a 50-bp window. The minimum identity shown in the VISTA plots is 30%..

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	39	Phylogenetic Footprinting and Promoter Analysis Phylogenetic footprinting of the human, mouse, and Fugu genomic sequences containing the SPRN/Sprn gene was performed by using the FootPrinter program as a Web service (Blanchette and Tompa 2002; http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/blanchem/FootPrinterWeb/FootPrinterInput.pl). We used sequence upstream to the Sho ORF and the whole intergenic region in this experiment. The orthologous rat, Tetraodon, and zebrafish sequence data were not used in this analysis because of gaps in the sequence (rat and zebrafish) or low quality (Tetraodon). We used a conservative approach in this analysis, accepting only motifs detected in all three species and setting low parsimony scores: score 0 for 6-bp and 7-bp motifs, score 1 for 8-bp and 9-bp motifs, and score 2 for 10-bp, 11-bp, and 12-bp motifs. A 13-bp motif (score 2) was identified after inspection of the 12-bp motif sequences. Potential transcription factor to binding sites in these same human and mouse genomic sequences were analyzed by using the MatInspector program available as a Web service (Quandt et al. 1995; http://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin/eldorado/main.pl). Again, we used a conservative approach in this analysis: motifs were identified with core similarity 1 and matrix similarity score above the optimized matrix similarity score. Motifs predicting transcription factor to binding sites deposited in the TRANSFAC database (Wingender et al. 1996) were identified..

The sequences of these two protein sets were aligned independently using ClustalW (Thompson, Higgins, and Gibson 1994), and the result was subsequently refined using genetic data environment (GDE) (Smith et al. 1994). From the PrP and Sho alignments, 118 and 149 sites, respectively, were chosen for phylogenetic analyses using the maximum-likelihood program package MOLPHY (Adachi and Hasegawa 1996). The two alignments were analyzed using ProtML (Adachi and Hasegawa 1996) with the JTT-F model of amino acid substitution. Initially, every possible tree was assessed to produce a set of 2,000 near-optimal trees (using the -jfen 2000 option). This set of trees was then analyzed more rigorously without, and with, nearest-neighbor interchanges (using the -jfu and -jfRu options). Local bootstrap probabilities (LBP) were estimated using the resampling estimated log-likelihood method for internal edges in the tree examined. Trees were compared statistically using the Kishino-Hasegawa test (Kishino and Hasegawa 1989), and topological model uncertainty (Wolf et al. 2000) was considered using model averaging (Jermiin et al. 1997); when considered, we used the class V weighting scheme with = 0.05 to produce (1) a majority-rule consensus tree and (2) relative-likelihood scores (RLS) for internal edges in the inferred phylogeny..

Genomic sequence of Tetraodon containing stPrP-2 and PrP-like proteins was derived by detecting overlapping genomic clones in the Genoscope database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/) and assembling them into a virtual genomic contig (Tetraodon virtual contig 1 [see below]). In figure 2, we present gene order and relative orientation in the local genomic regions of mammalian PRNP genes and fish genes encoding stPrP-1, stPrP-2, stPrP-3, and PrP-like proteins. In mammals, genes adjacent to PRNP and PRND are RASSF2 and SLC23A1. The PRNT gene is present in humans but not in rodents (fig. 2A [see also below]). In pufferfish, genes encoding stPrP-2 and PrP-like proteins are also adjacent to Rassf2-coding and Slc23a1-coding genes (fig. 2C). The stPrP-2 to coding gene is in the same position and relative orientation with respect to the adjacent genes as is mammalian PRNP, suggesting an evolutionary relationship..

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	47	  In contrast, the stPrP-1 to coding genes from Fugu and zebrafish are located in different genomic environments (fig. 2D and E). In the Fugu genome, stPrP-1 is flanked distally by TA-PPC2 (T-cell activation protein phosphatase 2C) and EPI-64 (epi64 protein). Proximally, it is arranged head-to-head with a gene that appears to be a homolog, SPRNB, of the gene, SPRN, which we recently discovered encoding the protein Shadoo (Sho) (Premzl et al. 2003); SPRNB, in turn, is flanked by KCNIP3 (calsenilin) (see also below). In the zebrafish genome, we detected stPrP-1 adjacent to sprnb, also head-to-head, but flanked, interestingly, by the rassf2 gene proximally and the slk gene (STE20-like kinase) distally (i.e., a different genomic environment from that in Fugu). The proximity in fish of the two genes, stPrP-1 and SPRNB/sprnb, is very interesting, suggesting an evolutionary and possible functional link between stPrP-1 and Sho2 proteins. We have not found the SPRNB gene in mammalian sequence databases. There are several possible explanations; for example, the gene has been lost from the mammalian lineage, or it is so diverged that searches cannot recognize it. The most obvious possibility, that the gene was duplicated after divergence of mammals and fish, is not consistent with phylogenetic results we present later..
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	48	We found another stPrP-like gene, we here call stPrP-3, in zebrafish in the Ensembl genomic contig NA3274.1. Its proximal flanking gene is unknown, but its distal flanking genes code for green cone photoreceptor (gcp) and annexin a6 (anxa6)..
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	49	We observe some major differences between the PrP-related genes in the mammalian and fish genomes. First, neither PRND nor PRNT genes were detected in fish. Although the similarity in position and orientation of PRNT in human and the PrP-like gene in pufferfish might suggest orthology, sequence comparison shows no similarity (i.e., they are different genes). Obversely, no PrP-like protein to coding genes were found in mammals. Suzuki et al. (2002) correctly noted that the genes encoding Rassf2 and Slc23a1 are in proximity to the PrP-like protein to coding gene in Fugu but reported them in a different gene order and relative gene orientation. Rivera-Milla, Stuermer, and Malaga-Trillo (2003) stated that the genomic environments around the Fugu genes encoding PrP461 and PrP-like proteins seemed to have undergone multiple chromosomal rearrangements, but they did not present supporting data. In the Fugu genomic data, Oidtmann et al. (2003) found the stPrP-1 to coding gene on scaffold_96, and the stPrP-2 to coding gene on scaffold_155, adjacent to the PrP-like protein to coding gene; they concluded it was unlikely that ancestors of the stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 genes evolved directly into present mammalian forms of PRNP and PRND. As supported by our later phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that stPrP-2 shares an ancestor with the fish gene encoding stPrP-1, but the gene duplication giving rise to stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 occurred after the evolutionary separation of fish and mammals. Although stPrP-2 in pufferfish and PRNP in mammals share the same proximity to the Rassf2-coding and Slc23a1-coding genes and are likely orthologous, their sequences have diverged greatly, and they may have evolved significantly different functions. The relaxation of conserved contiguity between the sites with different genes distal to PRNP and stPrP-2 (i.e. PRND and PrP-like genes) suggests independent duplications producing PRNP-PRND and stPrP-2 and PrP-like genes. As shown in figure 1, the C-terminal regions of PrP and stPrP-2 proteins have similar features, but these are not present in the PrP-like protein sequences; hence, the function of the PrP-like protein is likely different from that of stPrP-2..

(2003) found the stPrP-1 to coding gene on scaffold_96, and the stPrP-2 to coding gene on scaffold_155, adjacent to the PrP-like protein to coding gene; they concluded it was unlikely that ancestors of the stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 genes evolved directly into present mammalian forms of PRNP and PRND. As supported by our later phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that stPrP-2 shares an ancestor with the fish gene encoding stPrP-1, but the gene duplication giving rise to stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 occurred after the evolutionary separation of fish and mammals. Although stPrP-2 in pufferfish and PRNP in mammals share the same proximity to the Rassf2-coding and Slc23a1-coding genes and are likely orthologous, their sequences have diverged greatly, and they may have evolved significantly different functions. The relaxation of conserved contiguity between the sites with different genes distal to PRNP and stPrP-2 (i.e. PRND and PrP-like genes) suggests independent duplications producing PRNP-PRND and stPrP-2 and PrP-like genes. As shown in figure 1, the C-terminal regions of PrP and stPrP-2 proteins have similar features, but these are not present in the PrP-like protein sequences; hence, the function of the PrP-like protein is likely different from that of stPrP-2..

Interestingly, we have recently detected an apparent duplication of the SPRN gene in human, about 140 kb downstream, from genomic data (L. Sangiorgio, B. Strumbo, and T. Simonic, unpublished results). We obtained the Tetraodon SPRNA context by finding overlapping genomic sequence reads in the Genoscope database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/) and assembling them into a virtual genomic contig (Tetraodon virtual contig 2 [see below]). (The fish gene is here labeled SPRNA to differentiate it from the related gene in fish, SPRNB, reported in this paper.) Genes adjacent to SPRN in mammals and SPRNA in pufferfish are those encoding the GTP-binding protein (GTP) and AO; both gene order and relative orientation are conserved in the two vertebrate clades, implying orthology. However, in zebrafish, although we found the GTP-binding to protein gene adjacent to sprna in the same tail-to-tail orientation, the proximal adjacent gene is the long-chain fatty-acyl elongase (fae) to coding gene rather than the AO-homologous gene. Because the next proximal genes are not known from the assembly, it is not clear whether the AO-encoding gene is present..

Although often considered as just "junk," it is now recognized that active elements have reshaped genomes (e.g., creating new, modified, or reshuffled genes). Passive elements are excellent markers for mutation and selection analyses (Lander et al. 2001). Differences in the repeat content and distribution denote differences in the gene/genome dynamics (Thomas et al. 2003). Discernable interspersed repeats are reported to comprise approximately 45% of the human genome (Lander et al. 2001) and 37.5% of the mouse genome (Waterston et al. 2002). The lower content in mouse is thought to be caused by a higher nucleotide substitution rate in mouse (4.5 x 10 to 9) than in human (2.2 x 10 to 9), which makes older elements difficult to identify. The depth of the repeat analysis using the RepeatMasker program (http://ftp.genome.Washington.edu/RM/RepeatMasker.html) is 150 to 200 and 100 to 120 MYA for human and mouse elements, respectively (Waterston et al. 2002)..

At two extremes, human Hox gene clusters contain less than 2% repeats in approximately 100 kb, whereas human Xp11 has accumulated 89% of transposable elements in a 525-kb region (Lander et al. 2001). There is also a strong correlation between divergence in noncoding DNA and the amount of repetitive DNA (Chiaromonte et al. 2001): "flexible" genomic regions accumulate many changes, whereas "rigid" regions accumulate fewer. Rigidity of sequence may reflect strong selection on a large number of gene regulatory elements (Lander et al. 2001), or, alternatively, may be determined by the local genomic mutation rate (Chiaromonte et al. 2001).

Makrinou, Collinge, and Antoniou (2002) reported the expression of the PRNT gene exclusively in testis, as for the PRND gene, and noted 50% similarity and 42% identity between a potential 94-residue protein and human Dpl. The absence of a long ORF and its apparently recent origin suggest that human PRNT is a pseudogene arising originally from duplication of PRND. Pseudogenes are often remnants of duplicate genes arising either from tandem duplication or retrotransposition of processed mRNA. Although their sequences show similarities to coding regions of known proteins, they have acquired many stop codons or frame shifts so that they no longer code for full-length protein. They are usually not transcribed but occasionally are resurrected in response to a new organismal need (Harrison and Gerstein 2002), or they acquire additional functions such as a specific regulatory role (Hirotsune et al. 2003). Also, in the intron of the PRNT gene, we detected a processed pseudogene sequence with high homology to the mRNA for isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1, which is disrupted by an Alu insertion..

Again, this implies caution must be applied in interpretation of the tree, this need being reflected also in some low LBP and RLS values (fig. 8). However, again we note we found only 49 "good" trees (i.e., the most-likely tree and the near-optimal trees) out of 2,027,025 possible trees, setting the result in a better light..

Most importantly, the fish Shos cluster with their mammalian homologs, rather than with their fish Sho2 paralogs. This clustering pattern strongly suggests orthology between mammalian and fish Shadoos, an inference previously made on the basis of sequence conservation (Premzl et al. 2003). As noted previously, conserved genomic context and failure to detect SPRNB in mammalian genomes suggests either that the SPRNB gene has been lost between fish and mammals or that it is highly diverged and yet to be found..

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	127	It is established that gene duplication occurred in several fish lineages and that many duplicated fish genes have only one homolog in mammals (Taylor et al. 2003; Aparicio et al. 2002). Two fates of duplicated genes have been proposed. The classical model of neofunctionalization predicts that one of the duplicate loci retains its original function, whereas the other duplicate is fixed only if rare beneficial mutations occur (Ohno 1970). This model fits current knowledge of Shos and Sho2s, with the Sho2 duplicate either deleted in mammals (and other tetrapods?) or so highly diverged by neofunctionalization that its mammalian ortholog is not recognizable. The alternative model proposes that both duplicates are preserved because of subfunctionalization, where proteins encoded by the duplicates complement each other functionally (Force et al. 1999). This model fits the fish stPrPs, which have sequences similar to each other but dissimilar to those of tetrapod PrPs..

The model consists of four regions: a basic region 1, which shows a tendency for insertion of repeat or other sequence (region 2), a hydrophobic region 3, and a C-terminal region 4. Figure 1 and figures S3 and S4 of Supplementary Material online show the model represents a quite dynamic structural scaffold, with substantial differences in the presence, lengths, and sequence compositions of the regions and insertions among the complete Sho/PrP set, particularly taking account of the numerous fish proteins. As we have already compared the sequence features of all proteins in figure 1 except for the ones newly reported here (TestPrP-2, ZestPrP-3, TeSho, FuSho2, TeSho2, CaSho2, and ZeSho2 [see table 1]), we confine attention here largely to the new proteins..

Most of the difference in length between TestPrP-2 and FustPrP-2 is in the large insertion in region 2, whereas the very large ZestPrP-3 protein shows increases of approximately 90 and approximately 45 residues in the region 2 insertion and in region 4, respectively, compared with stPrP-2s. More useful alignment and analysis requires better knowledge of the number of stPrP proteins in individual fish and their variation among the major fish lineages (see also Protein Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis above).

Although there are some local regions of sequence conservation, including around the N-glycosylation site conserved in all Shos and Sho2s, the C-terminal regions of fish Shos and Sho2s are quite diverged; this is also the sequence region most diverged between fish and tetrapod Shos (see above)..

(2002) made the initial suggestion of an evolutionary link between the fish PrP-like protein to coding genes and tetrapod PRNP genes. This was based on both weak "homology" (both encode extracellular GPI-anchored proteins with repeats and an unusual internal hydrophobic region [see figure 1]) and context-based (conservation of genes encoding Rassf2 and Slc23a1 in both genomic contexts) criteria. The report by Oidtmann et al. (2003) of the stPrP-2 to coding gene proximal to the PrP-like protein to coding gene in Fugu, somewhat strengthened the homology argument for an evolutionary relationship between tetrapod PRNPs and this fish gene because the C-terminal regions of the proteins are similar, whereas those of PrP-like proteins are quite different (see figure 1). However, this finding weakened the context-based argument. Although the orientation of the stPrP-2 gene is now the same as that of mammalian PRNP, the two genes are separated from the Rassf2 coding gene by different genes (PrP-like gene and PRND) with different orientations (fig. 2). We have suggested previously that this could be accounted for by independent duplications. Oidtmann et al. (2003) also reported another fish gene, stPrP-1, in another genomic context.

The model then proposes separation of the SPRN and SPRNB genes, by a translocation of half of the gene cluster. The subsequent history of the two branches suggests the genomic environment containing the SPRNB gene was highly recombinogenic, whereas that containing the SPRNA gene was stable, leading to the currently known fish and mammal Sho orthologs. The stability of this gene suggests that orthologous SPRN genes coding Sho protein will be found in the other tetrapod lineages. A further duplication of the SPRNB gene is then proposed, still before the divergence of fish from tetrapods, with the duplicate genes acquiring additional C-terminal coding sequence to produce SPRNB1 and SPRNB2 protogenes with a completed C-terminal domain, as in tetrapod PrP and fish stPrP-1/-2/-3 proteins (fig. 1)..

First, although in the SPRN and PRNP local genomic environments (covering several genes as in VISTA analyses in figure 4 and in figure S2 of Supplementary Material online), we found the percentage of repetitive elements is comparable (tables S2 and S3 of Supplementary Material online), at the single-gene level the picture is strikingly different. The SPRN gene has no transposable elements, whereas PRNP and PRND have up to 46% and 24%, respectively, in human, all in the introns (table 2). Consistent with this picture of gene dynamics, the brain-specific SPRN gene has evolved conservatively between fish and mammals, and Sho is predicted to have a conserved basic function in vertebrate brain..
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	155	Dynamics of Mammalian PRNP and SPRN Genes We observed some interesting differences in the mammalian SPRN and PRNP gene characteristics, which offer some insights into how these genes have been evolving. First, although in the SPRN and PRNP local genomic environments (covering several genes as in VISTA analyses in figure 4 and in figure S2 of Supplementary Material online), we found the percentage of repetitive elements is comparable (tables S2 and S3 of Supplementary Material online), at the single-gene level the picture is strikingly different. The SPRN gene has no transposable elements, whereas PRNP and PRND have up to 46% and 24%, respectively, in human, all in the introns (table 2). Consistent with this picture of gene dynamics, the brain-specific SPRN gene has evolved conservatively between fish and mammals, and Sho is predicted to have a conserved basic function in vertebrate brain..

These features are characteristic of genes evolving under relaxed evolutionary constraints, typical of proteins with rapidly evolving function (Harrison and Gerstein 2002; Kitami and Nadeau 2002). What these functions are has yet to be elucidated. Despite extensive study, the functions of mammalian PrP remain elusive (Aguzzi and Hardt 2003), and no functional studies, or tissue expression profiles, of the other tetrapod PrPs have been reported..

In this context we suggest that PrP and Sho are two components of a complex brain system, with distinct evolutionary histories and functional roles. Whereas the conserved Sho appears to have a conserved role in vertebrate brain ("maintenance"), the relaxed evolution of PrP may have fine-tuned its adaptive role in vertebrate brain in a lineage-specific fashion. The intriguing similarities in the overall structures for PrP and Sho, taken together with our new model for an ancient common evolutionary origin, reinforce our earlier suggestion (Premzl et al. 2003) that the functions may be partly overlapping. However, the fact that our model highlights other lineage-specific PrP-related genes, such as those encoding PrP-like protein, stPrP-1, and Sho2 in fish or Dpl in mammals, suggests PRNP and stPrP-2 genes may have developed lineage-specific functions through coevolution with these genes. It is possible that PrP's functions over vertebrate evolution have been coevolving with several varied partners and that it has acquired, and lost, a range of relatively weak or subtle, but useful, functions. In this sense PrP is "dispensable" (Hirsh and Fraser 2001), which allows its remarkable adaptation..

Similar genetic differences exist in sheep, in which PRNP polymorphisms modify the susceptibility to scrapie. However, the known coding polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP gene have little or no effect on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) susceptibility in cattle. We have recently found a tentative association between PRNP promoter polymorphisms and BSE susceptibility in German cattle (Sander, P., Hamann, H., Pfeiffer, I., Wemheuer, W., Brenig, B., Groschup, M., Ziegler, U., Distl, O., and Leeb, T. (2004) Neurogenetics 5, 19 to 25). A plausible hypothesis explaining this observation could be that the bovine PRNP promoter polymorphisms cause changes in PRNP expression that might be responsible for differences in BSE incubation time and/or BSE susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we performed a functional promoter analysis of the different bovine PRNP promoter alleles by reporter gene assays in vitro and by measuring PRNP mRNA levels in calves with different PRNP genotypes in vivo. Two variable sites, a 23-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism containing a RP58-binding site and a 12-bp indel polymorphism containing an SP1-binding site, were investigated. Band shift assays indicated differences in transcription factor binding to the different alleles at the two polymorphisms. Reporter gene assays demonstrated an interaction between the two postulated transcription factors and lower expression levels of the ins/ins allele compared with the del/del allele. The in vivo data revealed substantial individual variation of PRNP expression in different tissues. In intestinal lymph nodes, expression levels differed between the different PRNP genotypes..

The causative agents of these transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are infectious proteins, the so-called prions according to the widely accepted hypothesis of Prusiner (2). Normal host cellular prion protein (PrPc) changes its conformation due to triggering by inoculated scrapie PrPSC. Ingestion of meat and bone meal from scrapie-infected sheep and BSE-infected cattle initiated the large BSE outbreak in the United Kingdom in the last decade of the 20th century (3). Prions are transported eventually from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, in which spongiform degeneration of brain structure leads to neurodegenerative disorder. There is evidence that the immune system is involved in this process. Specifically, intestinal lymph nodes, B-lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and the spleen are essential for carrying PrPSc to the target organ brain (4 to 9)..

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	7	At least for some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, host genetic factors modulate susceptibility to prion infection. This phenomenon was initially discovered in sheep, in which several mutations within the coding sequence of the prion protein gene (PRNP) are known to lead to increased or decreased scrapie susceptibility (10 to 14). In humans, a polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP coding sequence is strongly correlated with susceptibility to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as all human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients share the homozygous Met129/Met129 genotype, whereas Val129/Val129 and heterozygous individuals have not been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease so far. However, in cattle, none of the known polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP coding sequence seem to have an influence on BSE susceptibility. Alternatively, it has been speculated that the promoter region of the PRNP gene might influence the expression level of the protein and thus the incubation period of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (15)..

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	9	We previously reported the first tentative association of BSE susceptibility with polymorphisms in the PRNP gene promoter (1). In our previous study, the allele frequencies at two linked insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP promoter differed significantly between the 48 healthy and 43 BSE-affected German cattle analyzed. The most common haplotypes at these two polymorphisms contained either both insertions (referred to as ins/ins) or both deletions (referred to as del/del). The frequency of the del/del haplotype was higher in the BSE-affected group. We therefore hypothesized that the observed differences in haplotype frequencies may reflect differences in PRNP promoter activity. According to this hypothesis, the del/del allele, which was over-represented in the affected group, should show stronger promoter activity than the ins/ins allele. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the functional properties of different allelic variants of the bovine PRNP promoter by performing reporter gene assays in vitro and by quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in vivo..

However, reproducible band shifts with nuclear extracts from pRP58-overexpressing cells were obtained (Fig. 3). The experiment showed that the 23-bp insertion allele produced strong and specific band shifts with transcription factor RP58.

In these four instances, no conclusive differences in the binding properties of the different respective alleles were observed. Both allelic POZ probes produced identical band shift patterns with two shifted bands for each probe. In the case of the  to 85G T polymorphism, both allelic probes led to a shifted band of the same size. The shifted band with the G allele had a higher intensity; however, as this allele was predicted to be the non-binding allele for NEUROG1, the polymorphism was not further studied. Both allelic AP2 probes did not produce any band shift, whereas a control oligonucleotide with a perfect AP2 consensus site led to a shifted band of the expected size. In the case of EGR4, both allelic probes produced identical band shift patterns with two bands for each probe. This led to the conclusion that only the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms are involved in differential allelic PRNP promoter modulation and thus in PrPc expression. Therefore, our further experiments focused on these two polymorphisms..

The pInsDel and pDelIns constructs displayed inconsistent expression levels in the two cell lines.

However, in three of four assays with the 23-bp insertion at position  to 1594, the overexpression of SP1 had no significant effect on luciferase expression. SP1 overexpression also led to an increase in reporter gene expression with pInsIns in the PT cell line. Thus, the presence of the 23-bp insertion in the 5'-flanking sequence seemed to reduce the SP1-induced activation of the PRNP promoter. The overexpression of recombinant RP58 also increased luciferase expression in all four constructs with the 23-bp deletion at position  to 1594, whereas the expression level did not change significantly in all four constructs with the 23-bp insertion..

RNA was isolated and used for qRT-PCR experiments measuring the absolute transcript quantities of the PRNP and GAPDH genes by the standard curve method. A relative quantification was performed by dividing the PRNP expression level by the GAPDH expression level. DNA from the same tissue samples was used for genotyping with regard to the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms. Five different genotypes were identified: 23del:12del (n = 27 to 30), 23del:12het (n = 5 to 6), 23het:12het (n = 39 to 41), 23het:12ins (n = 6 to 7), and 23ins:12ins (n = 15 to 16). The results from qRT-PCR were evaluated with respect to these five genotype groups..

The highest PRNP mRNA expression levels were encountered in the brain, followed by the spleen, liver, and intestinal lymph nodes. Within these tissue groups, the brain stem, spleen, and liver showed no significant differences in mean expression levels with respect to the genotypes. In lymph node samples, the 23het:12ins expression levels were lower than the 23del:12del, 23del:12het, and 23het:12het expression levels (supplemental Fig. 3). The raw data were not in a normal distribution. Often, single animals showed dramatic variations relative to the average. Intestinal lymph node expression levels of the most common genotypes are shown in Fig. 5. The liver expression levels were an exception; here, the raw data fit better to a normal distribution, and smaller standard errors were observed compared with the other tissues. The complete qRT-PCR data from all tissues are shown in supplemental Fig. 3..

We hypothesized that mutations affecting the PRNP expression level might have an influence on BSE incubation time and/or BSE susceptibility. We demonstrated a tentative association of BSE susceptibility with respect to the PRNP genotypes at the 23-bp indel polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking sequence and the 12-bp indel polymorphism in intron 1. The 12-bp indel polymorphism and a couple of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the putative promoter region are in strong linkage disequilibrium with the 23-bp indel polymorphism. We presumed that one of these polymorphisms might have an influence on the promoter activity leading to modified susceptibility..

Allelic variants at these six potential transcription factor-binding sites differ with respect to the consensus binding sites, and the involved transcription factors are themselves expressed in relevant tissues for BSE pathogenesis. These putative transcription factors are SP1, AP2, RP58, NEUROG1, EGR4, and POZ. SP1 is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in the regulation of many promoters (24). AP2 plays a role in tissues of ectodermal origin (25). RP58 was named according to its function and is expressed mainly in the brain (26, 27). It includes a POZ domain, which has been described as an interactor with SP1. It has been suggested that the POZ domain represses transcription by interfering with the DNA-binding activity of SP1 (28). EGR4 (also called nerve growth factor-induced clone C) is like neurogenin-1, a protein that is most likely involved in brain function (29, 30). The transcription factor POZ protein BCL6 plays a role in B-cell differentiation and represses transcription, as does RP58 (31)..

All oligonucleotide probes with the exception of the two allelic variants of the AP2-binding site produced band shifts. In the case of the two indel polymorphisms, the observed band shifts differed between allelic PRNP promoter variants. The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was checked by competition with unlabeled probes. In the case of SP1, the identity of the shifted band from the nuclear brain extract was further corroborated by a positive control experiment using purified recombinant SP1. The results of the RP58 EMSA suggest that RP58 had a higher affinity for the 23-bp insertion allele. The weak affinity of RP58 for the 23-bp deletion allele is not surprising, as the RP58-binding site is duplicated with just one mismatch outside the indel polymorphism..

The 12-bp indel polymorphism in intron 1 was deliberately included in the analysis, as it has previously been shown that intron 1 elements are necessary for bovine PRNP promoter activity (17). Our reporter gene assays revealed an influence of the indel polymorphisms on PRNP transcription rates. Surprisingly, in a short construct, the 12-bp insertion alone resulted in an increased expression level, whereas in the long construct in combination with the 23-bp insertion, the 12-bp insertion caused a decreased expression level. These findings are compatible with a model in which RP58 binds to the 5'-flanking sequence of the PRNP gene and represses PRNP promoter activity by an interaction with SP1 bound within intron 1, similar to known RP58-SP1 interactions in other promoters (28)..

The EMSA results certainly hinted at an involvement of RP58; however, the cotransfection experiments with RP58 were inconclusive. A possible explanation for these results is that the recombinant human RP58 used was indeed able to bind to the recognition sequence within the bovine promoter, but not to exert its repressing function in the heterologous bovine system..

We chose tissue samples from the spleen, brain stem, and intestinal lymph nodes because of their importance in the infection route of the prions. The liver was chosen as a control organ because it is supposedly not involved in BSE pathogenesis. Only the lymph nodes showed a significant distribution of the five genotype groups. As the expression level of PRNP in intestinal lymph nodes was very low compared with that in the other organs, this result raises the intriguing question of whether the low PRNP amounts in intestinal lymph nodes are rate-limiting for the conversion of cellular PrPc into PrPSc during the spread of BSE infection toward the central nervous system. The higher expression level of the pDelDel plasmid is consistent with our previous finding that the 23del:12del genotype is associated with higher susceptibility to BSE in German cattle (1)..

The influence of the promoter polymorphism on the expression levels is rather limited in comparison with the observed variance. This might be because we analyzed whole tissue samples, which may have been composed of varying proportions of different cell types. Future analyses should be performed at the single cell level, e.g. by in situ hybridizations, as it has previously been demonstrated that PRNP expression is not completely uniform within lymph nodes (32). Despite the large variance, the observed differences in PRNP expression levels are consistent with the notion that the 23-bp deletion allele is associated with higher susceptibility to BSE in German cattle..
