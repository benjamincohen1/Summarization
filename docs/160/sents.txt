0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	2	On 28 September 2003, a long blackout occurred in Italy, lasting from about 3 a.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	3	 until the morning; it was the largest blackout in Italy outside of wartime.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A few weeks before, a colossal blackout involved the USA and Canada; it was the greatest in history since the diffusion of electricity.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	5	We all know that our small, polluted, violent planet is endangered.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Since 11 September 2001, we feel that globalization is bringing more than the opening up of markets; we now fear terrorist attacks [1].
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The SARS epidemic and mad cow disease confronted us with new, potentially lethal diseases and with the dangers of forcing nature in order to increase food production [2].
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Nevertheless, in daily life we have lost the sense of danger.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	9	In the case of blackouts and other natural catastrophes, one of the crucial problems is the risk of lack of water or of water contamination.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The water purification and distribution systems consume a large amount of electricity and water may not be available during, or safe after, a long electric blackout.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	11	Dialysis, the most widespread chronic life-saving therapy worldwide, requires a large quantity of microbiologically pure, controlled water (500 ml/min of treatment; 120 l for a standard 4 h treatment) [3].
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This is one of the impediments to the diffusion of dialysis in the Third World, but it may also become an acute problem at particular times even in developed countries.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	13	Three years ago, there was a flood in Turin, northern Italy, a city of about 900 000 inhabitants.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The aqueduct water was polluted in some areas and at risk in others.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In such a situation, in which there is the risk of massive microbiological or toxic (metals and biological compounds) contamination, the water depuration systems, targeted to the usually low amount of contaminants present in the aqueduct water, do not guarantee that the water is pure enough for dialysis.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This is both true in the case of large depuration systems, with reverse osmosis, such as those employed in the large dialysis centres, where a water purity problem could endanger hundreds of patients within a couple of days, and, even more so, in the case of home haemodialysis patients, whose water treatment system consists of a small  portable  osmosis kit and a water softener.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	17	Our dialysis centre was able to overcome the emergency and to support the other dialysis centres in Turin because of its policy of maintaining the haemofiltration (HF) technique (the only one that does not require water) as a  rescue treatment  for patients with poor tolerance of conventional dialysis techniques and for patients with acute renal failure in our hospital, mainly in the intensive care unit (ICU).
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In recent years, this technique was, on average, employed in 3 to 5% of hospital dialysis patients, a pool of 65 to 70 cases, out of a global dialysis population of about 200 patients, 45 to 55 on peritoneal dialysis, 18 to 22 on home haemodialysis and the rest in out-of-hospital settings.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	19	Due to the flood, during the week of 16 to 22 October 2000, the dialysis centre of our hospital shifted the bicarbonate and haemodiafiltration dialysis treatments scheduled for 84 outpatients to HF (208 HF sessions performed).
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Another 45 sessions were performed on hospitalized patients.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Home haemodialysis patients of the area were treated in hospital until the end of the flood and returned home after microbiological and metal control of the water.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	22	Our experience during the flood taught us that HF should be considered not only a  clinical rescue  treatment, able to improve dialysis tolerance in a very small percentage of our most fragile patients, but also a  logistical rescue  treatment.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Therefore, our centre chose not to switch to online HF, so as to maintain in clinical use, without rapidly losing the practical know-how, at least one water-independent extracorporeal dialysis technique.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	24	A further example of the use of this  logistical rescue  occurred during the recent eruption of the Mount Etna volcano.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A daily home haemodialysis patient, depending on our centre, who was living in the affected area, was ready to switch to HF in case of water purity problems.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	26	During the Saturday night of the recent blackout, the availability of HF allowed us to safely treat a patient needing dialysis before vascular surgery and to perform the slow HF treatments scheduled (12 h) for three patients in ICUs.
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	27	While our habitat steadily approaches the catastrophic panoramas of science-fiction movies, we should also reconsider natural and man-made catastrophes, almost forgotten by the last two generations of Europeans [1,2].
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	28	 No field of medicine is immune to this need; in ours, the wise use of HF (a technique often considered too slow, too costly and too complex), at least at a level maintaining practical knowledge of its management, may be life-saving in times of emergency [4].
0.09740346.15735256.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Only history will tell if this becomes a new indication for HF.

0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, December 4, 2003 , and in revised form, January 28, 2004.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cellular prion protein (PrPc), a host-encoded, copper- and membrane-bound glycoprotein of unknown function, has a key role in TSE pathogenesis (4).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	5	 There is no agent replication or transmission of infectivity in the absence of PrPc expression (5).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Moreover, an abnormal, partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of PrPc specifically accumulates in the nervous system during infection and represents the hallmark of the disease (4, 6).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The conversion of PrPc to PrPSc is a posttranslational event associated with an increase in -sheet secondary structure in the protein (7, 8).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	8	CJD, like scrapie of sheep, comprises a broad spectrum of clinicopathological variants (9).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In scrapie transmitted to mice, the most extensively studied TSE, the strain of the agent and the host genotype variability determined by polymorphisms in the coding region of PRNP are the major determinants of disease phenotype (10).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Different prion strains transmit diseases to syngenic animals that differ in topography, type of lesion, and intracerebral distribution of PrPSc.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In humans, disease susceptibility and phenotypic expression are influenced by PRNP mutations and by the polymorphism at codon 129 that encodes either methionine (M) or valine (V) (11-13).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Distinct agent strains have been demonstrated (14-17) but remain to be characterized in full.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	13	Although uncertainties remain on the molecular basis of TSE strains and the relationship between strains and PrP, several lines of evidence indicate that PrPSc exists in a variety of molecular subtypes showing differences in conformation, glycosylation, protease resistance, and aggregation state (15, 18-23), which may encode, at least in part, strain-specific properties.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Furthermore, evidence from transmission studies indicates that the different PrPSc types showing distinct physicochemical properties represent genuine biochemical signatures of individual strain-host genotype interactions.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Because the analysis of biochemical properties of PrPSc is much less time-consuming than bioassays in mice, unraveling the physicochemical properties of PrPSc associated with each TSE strain or phenotype (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	16	 PrPSc "typing") has undoubtedly become of crucial importance for strain typing and molecular classification of TSEs, with wide implications for both disease diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	17	Unfortunately, there is a significant disparity in the literature regarding the existence of distinct human PrPSc types (23-27), and this to some extent is also true for animal TSEs (28-30).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Based on differences in gel mobility and N-terminal sequence of the core fragments generated by proteinase K (PK), Parchi et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	19	 (23-25) originally identified two human PrPSc types (named type 1 and type 2).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Type 1 has a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa and the primary cleavage site at residue 82, and type 2 has a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa and the primary cleavage at residue 97.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In other studies, however, the PrPSc type 1 from codon 129 MM subjects was further distinguished into 2 subtypes showing a less than a 1-kDa difference in mobility (26, 27).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (26) the two PrPSc type 1 subtypes, they named types 1 and 2, show indistinguishable fragment sizes only when PK digestion is performed in the presence of 20 mM EDTA, thereby representing two distinct conformations acquired by PrPSc in the presence of metal ions such as copper and zinc.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast, the two putative PrPSc subtypes described by Zanusso et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (27), also named types 1 and 2 although not comparable with those of Wadsworth et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	25	 (26), would represent two distinct protein conformations because of a different response to pH variations (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	26	 one conformation is pH-dependent; the other is not).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The rationale for the study of the effect of metal ions and pH on PrPSc properties lies in the finding that the octapeptide repeat PrPc sequence between residues 51 and 91 is a Cu 2+ binding motif that changes its conformation in the presence of copper and that this copper binding stoichiometry is pH-dependent (31, 32).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	28	In previous studies on PrPSc typing in sCJD, we also reported a certain degree of heterogeneity within both type 1 and type 2 samples, particularly among type 1 samples from codon 129 MM subjects (23, 24).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, these were subtle biochemical differences compared with the type 1/type 2 difference in relative molecular mass and failed to show a consistent reproducibility or a correlation with the disease pathological phenotype, suggesting that they might be related to the experimental conditions rather than to intrinsic differences in strains.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, it is noteworthy that the various protocols that have been applied to define PrPSc properties to date included the use of PK well outside its optimal conditions (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	31	5; optimum temperature above 37  degrees C) (33, 34) and, above all, were not standardized with respect to variables that might affect its activity.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	32	 On the other hand, the characterization of at least five distinct pathological sCJD subtypes (9) argues for the existence of more than two prion strains and two PrPSc types.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, it is conceivable that the application of more sensitive techniques and more rigorous experimental conditions will lead to the distinction between potential artifacts related to sample preparation and disease-specific biochemical differences suitable for a refined classification of CJD PrPSc types.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To reach this goal, shed light on the current PrPSc typing controversies, and further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of TSE strains and phenotypic variability, we examined the effect of different experimental conditions on the characteristics of PrPSc fragments associated with the sCJD subtypes and vCJD using a high resolution gel electrophoresis system.

0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Sarkosyl (1%) prevented the pH-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility seen in PrPSc MM1/MV1 (data not shown).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In addition, an indirect effect on PrPSc digestion by PK was seen with Sarkosyl (1%) or sodium deoxycholate (5%) because in these conditions a higher concentration of PK was needed to obtain a complete PrPSc digestion (data not shown).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	241	We have shown that, due to the lack of sufficient buffer capacities of standard Tris or PBS buffers, there is a significant heterogeneity in pH among CJD brain homogenates even when they are prepared from the same brain.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The homogenate pH in turn influences the size of the PrPSc core generated by protease digestion due to the combination of at least three factors.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	243	 (i) Protease digestion of full-length PrPSc is a step-by-step process yielding fragments with various degrees of resistance, (ii) PK activity is pH-dependent, (iii) in sCJD MM1, MV1, and to a lesser extent in VV1, the size of PrPSc further changes depending on whether protease digestion is performed at a pH below or above 7.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	244	Currently, there is a significant disparity in the literature regarding the existence of distinct human PrPSc types.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	245	 After the original identification by Parchi et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	246	 (24, 25) of two major PrPSc types (named type 1 and type 2) in sporadic human TSEs, two additional classifications of human PrPSc types have been proposed (26, 27).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	247	 (26) PrPSc type 1 from MM subjects can be distinguished into 2 subtypes based on a 0.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	248	5-kDa difference in the relative molecular mass of PrPSc.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	249	 However, when pK digestion is performed in the presence of at least 20 mM EDTA, the two PrPSc subtypes show the same electrophoretic mobility, with an estimated shift of about 1.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	250	650 kDa for the first and second type, respectively.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	251	 (27) also proposed that the Parchi et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	252	 (24) PrPSc type 1 includes two protein subtypes having distinct conformations and strain-specific properties.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	253	 However, at variance with Wadsworth et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	254	 (26), they distinguished the two PrPSc subtypes based on their sensitivity to pH variations rather than on their presumed degree of binding to metal ions.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	255	 According to the study by Zanusso et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	256	 (27), about 60% of type 1 samples show a pH-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility, whereas the remaining 40% appear unaffected by pH variations.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	257	In our original descriptions of human PrPSc types (23, 24) we also noticed a certain degree of PrPSc heterogeneity among subjects belonging to the same sCJD subtype (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	258	), particularly among MM1 subjects.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	259	 However, at variance with the above-mentioned studies, we did not attempt to further sub-classify the human PrPSc types based on the observations that (i) the same degree of variability was also seen in samples taken from the same brain, and ii) this molecular heterogeneity did not correlate with any distinct phenotypic feature.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	260	By demonstrating that the heterogeneity of human PrPSc type 1 within specific groups (MM or MV subjects) strictly depends on pH variations among CJD brain homogenates, the present study provides a reasonable technical explanation for the PrPSc molecular heterogeneity associated with sCJD MM1 or MV1.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Thus, we believe that there is no basis at present for claiming that more than one CJD subtype or CJD strain is associated with the molecular combination codon 129 MM genotype and PrPSc type 1.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Indeed, our results clearly show that, once the experimental conditions (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	263	 homogenate pH, PK concentration, type of detergents) are carefully controlled, the electrophoretic mobility of PrPSc type 1 from MM subjects is highly homogenous.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In this respect, it is also noteworthy that experimental transmission of prions from pure MM1 subjects to non-human primates and mice have given to date homogenous results in terms of incubation time or lesion profile (14, 16, 17).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These results are in keeping with the original classification of Parchi et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	266	 (9) and strongly suggest that only a single major agent strain is associated with the sCJD MM1 subtype.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	267	We cannot provide a definite explanation for the finding of Zanusso et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	268	 (27), who observed a pH-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility in only about 60% of MM1 subjects.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	269	 It is of significance, however, that they did not perform any direct measurement of actual pH in the homogenates.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Thus, they may unwittingly have compared PrPSc core fragments generated at different pHs.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	271	 It is also noteworthy that Wadsworth et al.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	272	 (26), in perfect agreement with our results, reported a shift in electrophoretic mobility in all their sCJD MM subjects with either PrPSc type 1 or type 2 (i.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	273	 corresponding to our type 1) when they were treated with 20 mM EDTA at pH 8 before PK digestion.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	274	 However, according to our results the change in PK cleavage depends on homogenate pH variations rather than on EDTA.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	275	Our finding of decreased pH values in brains from patients with sCJD deserves further comment.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The observation raises the interesting question of whether the acidic pH is somehow related to the disease pathogenesis.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Previous studies document a decline in post-mortem human brain pH values that positively correlate with age at death and agonal state severity (38, 39).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Moreover, we found that in non-human primates experimentally infected with prions who did not suffer from an agonal state, the brain pH was much less acidic (data not shown).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Further studies on brain metabolites in vivo, however, will be required to provide a definitive answer to this issue.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	280	Our data also shed light on the current understanding of the molecular basis of human TSE strains and phenotypic variability.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Several lines of evidence indicate that the pathological heterogeneity of human TSEs is related to the physicochemical properties of protease-resistant prion protein (24, 25).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	282	 However, whether each phenotype is indeed related to a specific PrPSc tertiary or quaternary structure is still unknown.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	283	 In sporadic CJD five phenotypes have been characterized, but only two major PrPSc types have been consistently reproduced based on difference in the relative molecular mass of PrPSc (9).
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	284	 By using gels with improved resolution and different experimental conditions, we have now shown that PrPSc type 1 in codon 129 MM or MV subjects has distinct physicochemical properties from the type 1 in the VV homozygotes.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In addition, only in MM1/MV1 and VV1 samples did PrPSc show a pH-dependent shift in gel mobility.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Our data also show that distinct physicochemical properties characterize the sCJD subtypes associated to PrPSc type 2.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	287	 For example, PrPSc from MV subjects with kuru plaques is clearly distinguishable from the other type 2s because it uniquely resolves as a doublet, even when a relatively high pK concentration is used.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Furthermore, we have shown that PrPSc from VV2 subjects as well as vCJD display a significantly higher protease resistance than the PrPSc from MM2-cortical cases.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Thus, analysis of protease resistance may allow the distinction between VV2 and MM2-cortical cases without PRNP genotyping and further helps, in combination with the study of PrPSc glycoform ratio (36), to distinguish vCJD from other CJD MM2 subtypes.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Taken together, these data demonstrate that there are specific PrPSc properties associated with each sCJD pathological phenotype as well as vCJD, supporting the notion that at least in human TSEs the pathological phenotype is related to differences in PrPSc molecular structure.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	291	By improving the molecular distinction between sCJD subtypes, our data also have important implications for the future epidemiological studies into the etiology of sCJD.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Indeed, the epidemiology of sCJD to date has been analyzed considering sCJD as a single entity, which might have prevented the discovery of risk factors associated with single or subgroups of sCJD subtypes.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Finally, it is reasonable to believe that our study will also contribute to standardizing and harmonizing PrPSc typing among laboratories, which will represent the basis for the new epidemiologic approach.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	294	 In this regard we wish to underline the protocol, which in our opinion gives the best visualization of the heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility (typing) among human PrPSc subtypes (Fig.
0.09852033.14754888.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This includes (i) a homogenizing solution with strong buffer capacity such as our LB with 100 mM Tris, (ii) protease digestion at pH 6.

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	7	In recent years, two major players have emerged as being possibly involved in the pathogenesis of lipodystrophies.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The first is lamin A/C, the nuclear lamina constituent mutated in FPLD and MAD cells (2,3) as well as in progeroid syndromes with lipodystrophy (8 to 11).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, mutations of ZMPSTE 24, the metalloprotease involved in lamin A processing (12), cause diseases featuring a lipodystrophy phenotype such as MAD in humans (13), a MAD-resembling phenotype in knockout mice (14,15) and a HGPS (Markquardt, personal communication).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	10	The second emerging protein in the pathogenesis of lipodystrophy is the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a transcription factor whose localization and transactivation ability appear to be altered in acquired lipodystrophy (7,16).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In this context, it is noteworthy that mutations of PPAR transcription factor, which is transcribed downstream of SREBP1 activation and mediates adipocyte differentiation (17), are responsible for other forms of partial lipodystrophy (6,18).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, a single point mutation in the PPAR promoter has been recently associated with FPLD (19).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	13	Lamins A and C are nuclear lamina proteins obtained by alternative splicing of LMNA and are almost ubiquitously expressed in differentiated tissues (20).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Before being assembled in the nuclear lamina, lamin A undergoes complex post-translational modifications including farnesylation of the C-terminus and protease cleavage (12,13,21).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Farnesylation of pre-lamin A is necessary for the following steps of protein cleavage, as metalloproteases fail to bind non-farnesylated lamin A sequence (15).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mature lamin A forms a heterodimeric complex with lamin C (22), which appears to play structural and functional roles, not completely elucidated (20).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Lamin A/C interacts with lamin B and emerin (23) as well as constituents of the nuclear matrix including lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) 2 alpha (24), nuclear actin (25,26), transcription factor E2F and protein Rb (27).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An increasing number of LMNA mutations give rise to several diseases grouped under the definition of laminopathies, but characterized by different tissue-specific defects (28).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Besides the earlier-mentioned disorders affecting adipose tissue and/or causing pre-mature aging, LMNA-linked disorders include autosomal-dominant Emery to Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (29), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (30), dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system disease (31) affecting skeletal and/or cardiac muscle and other diseases affecting different tissues such as Charcot to Marie to Tooth neuropathy type 2 (32).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The pathogenesis of EDMD and other laminopathies has been extensively investigated in recent years (33 to 37) and there is circumstantial evidence that lamin A/C interaction with either nuclear envelope constituents or chromatin may be affected in the diseases (20,38 to 42).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	21	SREBP/ADD1 was initially cloned from rat adipose tissue (43) and shown to be activated in cultured fibroblasts, adipocytes and liver (44,45).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The human homolog of ADD1, SREBP1, plays a major role in the control of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, whereas a closely related factor, SREBP2, is mostly related to cholesterol metabolism (46).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	23	 SREBP1 is synthesized as an 125 kDa precursor and it is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Depletion of cholesterol causes proteolytic cleavage of the transcriptionally active N-terminal portion of SREBP1 from its position to allow translocation into the nucleus (47).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A number of published data suggest that SREBP1 interacts with the nuclear envelope at an undefined site, while being transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear interior (48).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interestingly, SREBP1 and lamin A/C do interact in vitro (34), suggesting that alteration of their interplay may underlie the pathogenic mechanism of lipodystrophies.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recent evidence shows that impairment of SREBP1 accumulation inside the nucleus occurs in pre-adipocytes treated with an agent employed in HAART and causative of acquired lipodystrophy (7,16).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Retention of SREBP1 at the nuclear envelope is observed under these experimental conditions, concomitant with anomalous accumulation of unprocessed lamin A at the nuclear rim (7).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Downstream of SREBP1 retention at the nuclear envelope, activation of the transcription factor PPAR, which regulates adipocyte differentiation, is impaired (16), indicating a possible pathogenetic pathway for acquired lipodystrophy.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	30	In this study, we evaluated lamin A precursor maturation and intermolecular interactions in LMNA-mutated FPLD, MAD and WS fibroblasts and control fibroblasts.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Our results show that pre-lamin A is processed to a reduced rate in FPLD, MAD and WS cells leading to precursor protein accumulation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Pre-lamin A is bound to SREBP1 at the nuclear rim, thus limiting translocation of the transcription factor to the nuclear interior.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	33	 By using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes as a cellular model, we also show that forced pre-lamin A accumulation reduces the rate of DNA-bound SREBP1 and lowers PPAR expression.

0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	210	The proposed mechanism involves primarily in the accumulation of pre-lamin A and selective binding of the lamin A precursor to the adipocyte transcription factor SREBP1.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In MAD, FPLD and WS cells, we observed an accumulation of the lamin A precursor.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Interestingly, the amount of pre-lamin A was not increased in EDMD2 fibroblast cell lines, indicating that impairment of lamin A precursor maturation is specifically associated with lipodystrophy-linked lamin A mutations.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, the reason why lamin A processing is selectively affected by R482L, R527H and S143F LMNA mutations is not obvious.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	214	 At present, we can rule out the possibility of altered interplay between pre-lamin A and farnesyltransferases.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In fact, mevinolin treatment was effective in increasing mutated pre-lamin A amount in MAD, FPLD and WS fibroblasts, suggesting that farnesylation of pre-lamin A is an ongoing mechanism in these cells (MAD being a recessive disease model, only expressing mutated lamin A).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	216	 On the other hand, altered interaction of mutated pre-lamin A with ZPMSTE 24 endoprotease might affect protein processing.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	217	 It is noteworthy that ZPMSTE 24 mutations lead to accumulation of pre-lamin A due to impaired cleavage of the farnesylated protein and cause MAD (13), HGPS (Markquardt, personal communication) and restrictive dermopathy (49) in humans and a MAD-resembling phenotype in mice (14,15).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	218	We localized pre-lamin A-labeled intra-nuclear structures both in wild-type and in laminopathic cells accumulating the lamin A precursor.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Such structures have been previously shown in wild-type cells induced to accumulate pre-lamin A (21,50).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, additional dominant negative effects of mutations appear to affect differently both number and shape of pre-lamin A-labeled structures in each laminopathic cell line.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In the case of MAD and WS fibroblasts, pre-lamin-A-containing structures mostly protrude through the nuclear interior, as was also observed in control nuclei, whereas in R482L FPLD nuclei they are mostly localized at the nuclear lamina level.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We recently noticed that the number of pre-lamin-A-labeled intra-nuclear structures and the level of lamin A precursor were significantly increased in older MAD patients, though carrying the same R527H LMNA mutation (data not shown).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Noticeably, pre-lamin A-labeled structures may co-localize with emerin in wild-type and EDMD2 nuclei, but not in FPLD, MAD and WS nuclei, suggesting disease-specific changes of intermolecular interactions (42).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	224	Because we had determined a link between pre-lamin A accumulation and LMNA-associated lipodystrophies, we decided to investigate whether pre-lamin A interacted with the transcription factor SREBP1, which mediates adipocyte differentiation (44).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In vitro binding of SREBP1 to lamin A/C had been demonstrated by Lloyd et al.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	226	 (34) and the site of interaction had been mapped between aminoacids 227 and 487 of SREBP1 N-terminus sequence (34).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time in vivo binding of the lamin A precursor to SREBP1.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	228	 As expected, the low-molecular-weight form of SREBP1 interacts with pre-lamin A, indicating involvement of the nuclear lamina protein in the localization of the active transcription factor.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	229	 (34) performed a GST binding-assay with a lamin A peptide spanning aminoacids 389 to 664, which includes pre-lamin A C-terminal sequence.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Thus, our results confirm that the whole unprocessed lamin A molecule is required for SREBP1 interaction in vivo.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The previously suggested reduction of lamin A to SREBP1 binding affinity caused by R482 LMNA mutation (34) does not appear to affect in vivo interaction between pre-lamin A and SREBP1.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This might be related to the increased availability of pre-lamin A in FPLD cells, which could overcome the reduced binding affinity caused by the mutation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that a different aminoacid substitution (R482L instead of R482W) may differently affect protein interplay (42).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	234	By treating pre-adipocytes with farnesylation inhibitors, we obtained a suitable cellular model that reproduced the situation of pre-lamin A accumulation in adipose tissue.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This allowed us to investigate some biological mechanisms downstream of reduced pre-lamin A maturation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	236	We showed that the retention of active SREBP1 at the nuclear lamina occurs in pre-adipocytes accumulating pre-lamin A, as demonstrated by the significantly increased proportion of mature SREBP1 found in the nuclear insoluble fraction following DNase extraction.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Immunofluorescence labeling allowed us to show co-localization of SREBP1 and pre-lamin A in the nuclei accumulating pre-lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In fact, DNA-bound transcription factor disappears from control nuclei after the removal of DNA, whereas lamina-associated SREBP1 is still retained in the nuclei accumulating pre-lamin A and shows a typical nuclear rim staining.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	239	 We suggest that the reduced rate of lamin A precursor processing allows detection of pre-lamin A-bound SREBP1, which is hardly detectable in control cell lines undergoing rapid pre-lamin A maturation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	240	It is noteworthy that SREBP1 nuclear translocation is impaired in Lmna-null mouse cardiomyocytes, but not in the adipose tissue from Lmna null mice (36), indicating that nuclear import of SREBP1 in adipocytes does not require Lmna products.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These data and our present results support the view that SREBP1 to pre-lamin A interplay has a physiological role in the negative regulation of SREBP1 nuclear translocation in adipose tissue, so that excess accumulation of pre-lamin A selectively sequesters SREBP1 at the adipocyte nuclear envelope.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	242	 On the other hand, pre-lamin A might play a positive regulation role for SREBP1 nuclear import in other cell types such as cardiac myocytes (36).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In agreement with this hypothesis, pre-lamin A to SREBP1 interplay, which is potentially disrupted by some LMNA mutations causing AD-EDMD (34), might be involved in the nuclear import of the transcription factor in skeletal muscle cells.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	244	Retention of SREBP1 at the nuclear rim was previously reported in 3T3-F442A pre-adipocytes treated with Indinavir, a drug employed in HAART and causing lipodystrophy as a side-effect (7).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Under these experimental conditions, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts show increased pre-lamin A level and reduced PPAR expression (7).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	246	 These and our results strongly suggest that retention of SREBP1 at the nuclear rim of lipodystrophy cells is associated with the presence of increased pre-lamin A level, irrespective of the occurrence of LMNA mutations.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In fact, the identification of a selective and stable interplay between pre-lamin A and SREBP1 helps to explain the pathophysiology of both acquired and inherited lipodystrophy, the latter due to either lamin A/C or ZMPSTE 24 mutations.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Moreover, it is noteworthy that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (causing pre-lamin A accumulation) have been previously reported to impair adipocyte differentiation (51,52).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Our results help in explaining the biological mechanism underlying this effect.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	250	A key event of adipocyte differentiation is the induction of the transcription factor PPAR which is triggered by SREBP1 (48).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Downregulation of PPAR expression was obtained in pre-adipocytes accumulating the lamin A precursor either by mevinolin treatment or by overexpressing uncleavable pre-lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Uncleavable mutants of lamin A have been shown to assemble and localize at the nuclear envelope with kinetics comparable with that of wild-type protein (53).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The L648R-lamin A mutant did in fact localize at the nuclear envelope, where it could potentially bind SREBP1, as observed for de-farnesylated pre-lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Interestingly, a reduced PPAR level was also observed in adipocytes accumulating wild-type FLAG to pre-lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In the latter case, the increase of pre-lamin A level was directly attributable to overexpression of the exogenous protein.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These results support the view that excess accumulation of pre-lamin A is sufficient to sequester an amount of SREBP1, even in the presence of mature lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Thus, PPAR induction, a key step of adipocyte differentiation, may be altered in laminopathies featuring lipodystrophy, as already proposed for acquired lipodystrophies (7,16).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	258	In fact, adipocyte differentiation was impaired by pre-lamin A accumulation, as determined by oil red O staining of mevinolin- or FTI-277-treated pre-adipocyte cultures.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Given that FTI-277 selectively affects pre-lamin A processing without any interference with ras protein farnesylation or with cholesterol synthesis (54), we conclude that reduced adipocyte differentiation is a direct effect of pre-lamin A accumulation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It should be noted that highly differentiated cultures were not affected by drug treatment (data not shown), in agreement with the evidence that an early event in the adipocyte differentiation pathway, such as PPAR activation, is affected by pre-lamin A.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	261	PPAR expression has been reported to be regulated dependent on the body district (55).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	262	 This important observation suggests that pre-lamin A accumulation may elicit different effects in different fat depots depending on the extent of PPAR activation required in that particular area.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This could, in part, explain the selective involvement of some but not all adipose tissue districts in partial lipodystrophies.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	264	Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells accumulating pre-lamin A with the PPAR ligand TZD elicited rescue of the adipogenic program.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The latter finding gives an important insight into possible therapeutic approaches to lipodystrophy, which have been already reported to elicit some promising effects (56).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	266	As MAD is a recessive disease, one would expect pre-lamin A accumulation even in the heterozygous state, i.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	267	 in a percentage of cells from parents of affected individuals bearing one mutated allele (3).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	268	 We did not observe a significant increase of pre-lamin A amount in those cells.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, this study deserves further deepening, since we found that overexpression of R527H-mutated lamin A in transfected cells causes accumulation of mutated pre-lamin A (but not endogenous pre-lamin A) (data not shown).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	270	 On the other hand, MAD phenotype is not observed in heterozygous individuals, strongly supporting the view that a threshold pre-lamin A level is required to activate the pathogenic mechanism.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Regarding the pathophysiology of MAD and WS, two main questions need further investigation.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The first is the effect elicited by the accumulation of lamin A precursor protein in osteoblasts.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In fact, bone resorption of the extremities is a specific feature of MAD phenotype (3) and osteoporosis is also observed in WS patients (11) (though it might be related to the aging process featuring this disease).
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	274	 We are now addressing this problem by evaluating the effect of high pre-lamin A level in pre-osteocyte differentiation or survival.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The other open question is the pathogenetic mechanism leading to a premature aging phenotype in MAD patients and mostly in WS patients.
0.10063774.15843404.html.plaintext.txt	276	 We suggest that this phenotype could be dependent both on an anomalous amount of pre-lamin A and on altered interaction between mutated lamin A/C and its nuclear binding partners.

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	3	Sequence comparisons demonstrate that HtorA is a member of the HSP100/Clp family of ATP-dependent chaperones that functions in the assembly, disassembly and operation of a variety of protein complexes including those involved in many types of vesicular transport (8).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Immunolocalization of HtorA expressed in transfected cell lines suggests that it is a lumenally oriented protein localized to the intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, expression of E HtorA did not suppress -synuclein aggregation (13).

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These observations suggest that HtorA could function as a chaperone involved in the folding or processing of secreted or membrane proteins.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The effects of the E mutation on HtorA functions are unknown although the dominant phenotype together with other observations suggests that the mutant protein has a dominant negative or gain-of-function mode of action.

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These data suggested that the presence of clusters of E HtorA proteins in neurons or muscles might be not sufficient to induce behavioral abnormalities.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	61	 To explain the 30 to 40% penetrance of the E HtorA mutation in humans, a second-hit model has been proposed according to which environmental factors or other genetic mutations are required to evoke severe behavioral abnormalities (9,15,16).

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The weaker phenotype of the flies expressing E HtorA in dopaminergic neurons compared with the pan-neurally expressing flies suggests that the early onset and more severe phenotype requires E HtorA expression in multiple types of neurons, which may include motor neurons.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	81	Postsynaptic expression of E HtorA in muscles also resulted in an age- and temperature-dependent loss of locomotor control with 90 to 100% of the E HtorA-expressing flies remaining on the bottom of the vials at 38 degrees C after 9 days of age (Fig.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	82	In summary, expression of E HtorA in Drosophila either in neurons or muscles can cause severe motor impairments as a function of age and environmental conditions, and the severity and age of onset of this phenotype vary depending on the spatial pattern of expression.

0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	174	In fact, we have found several phenotypic abnormalities associated with E HtorA expression that are not temperature-dependent and that could underlie the observed behavioral defects at elevated temperatures.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Similar to what has been observed in transfected human cells in culture (9,10), we found that E HtorA forms protein aggregates when expressed in Drosophila neurons or muscles (Figs 1 and 3).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Localization of E HtorA protein clusters at the confocal microscopy level revealed that some of these clusters were associated with synaptic boutons particularly in the region of the SSR or colocalized with endosomal markers (Fig.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In addition to confirming the presence of E HtorA in SSR and in association with endosomes, immuno-EM studies demonstrated that E HtorA was also found associated with synaptic densities and the nuclear envelope (Fig.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The subcellular localization of E HtorA raises the possibility that it could interfere with a signal transduction pathway between synapses and nuclei that is required for proper synaptic development and function.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	179	Detailed confocal and electron microscopic examination of synaptic boutons revealed a number of structural defects in E HtorA-expressing larvae (Figs 5 and 6).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The presence of free dense bodies was particularly intriguing because this phenotype has only previously been reported for mutations that perturb the TGF-ss signaling pathway.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	181	 TGF-ss signaling pathways regulate many developmental and physiological processes both in vertebrates and invertebrates and perturbations in these signaling pathways have been implicated in a wide array of pathological conditions (34).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Recent studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that proper development and plasticity of synaptic boutons in the larval NMJ is dependent on TGF-ss pathway, at least in part, by wit (26,27).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Downregulation of TGF-ss receptors at synaptic terminals via endocytotic internalization appears to be an important mechanism for controlling synaptic plasticity (35).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In addition, experimental evidence suggests that retrograde transport of signaling to endosomes containing the activated TGF-ss receptor/Smads complexes from synaptic terminal or membranes to cell body might also be an essential aspect of the TGF-ss signaling mechanism to control development and function of the synapses (27,36).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	185	The existence of a known signaling pathway from synapse to nucleus via endosomal intermediates that regulates growth and development of synapses was of particular interest in the context of the present work because E HtorA expression perturbs synaptic development and E HtorA protein aggregates are found at precisely those subcellular locations synaptic terminals, endosomes and nuclei where they could most readily interfere with such a signaling pathway.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This possibility was further strengthened with the finding that the production of free dense bodies in motor terminals is associated with E HtorA expression as it is with mutations of components of the TGF-ss signaling (26,27).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	187	To investigate further whether the phenotypic abnormalities associated with E HtorA expression were, in fact, dependent on perturbing the TGF-ss signaling, we asked whether these phenotypes could be modified by overexpression of Mad or dSmad2, the transcriptional effectors of the TGF-ss pathway (26 to 29).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Remarkably, we found that pan-neural overexpression of dSmad2, but not Mad, substantially suppressed the defects in locomotor behavior as well as in synaptic morphology in E HtorA animals.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	189	As the locomotor defects observed in E HtorA flies at elevated temperatures bear some striking resemblance with the phenotype of torsion dystonia patients the possible involvement of common mechanisms does not seem unreasonable.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Moreover, a variety of data demonstrate that, as in Drosophila, TGF-ss signaling is important for the development of the mammalian nervous system and, in particular, plays an essential role in synaptic development and plasticity (34,37).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We also showed that expression of hSmad2 rescues abnormal behaviors as that of dSmad2 in flies (Fig.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Consequently, the possibility that the underlying mechanism of early onset torsion dystonia in humans involves a disruption of TGF-ss signaling merits further investigation.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	193	Early onset torsion dystonia is one of many severe complex neurobehavioral disorders caused by the interaction of multiple genes, or by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors (14,15).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	194	 As there is significant variation in phenotype manifested by human patients, identification of susceptible genes that may be responsible for triggering the severe symptoms is important in seeking an adequate treatment (1 to 5).
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In addition to examining human patients, another strategy is to find susceptible genes by taking advantage of an established animal model.
0.10246989.15269177.html.plaintext.txt	196	 As the studies reported here demonstrate, further studies in this Drosophila model for early onset torsion dystonia should provide unique opportunities to obtain additional novel information about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of this disorder.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, February 17, 2004 , and in revised form, May 4, 2004.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	4	The human PrP gene (PRNP) exists in two major allelic forms that encode either methionine or valine at codon 129, with allele frequencies of 0.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	5	37 in western European and American populations, respectively (8, 9).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This polymorphism is a key determinant of susceptibility to sporadic (10) and acquired (8, 11) prion diseases and may affect age at onset (12 to 14).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Based on the analysis of 300 sporadic CJD subjects, Parchi et al.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	8	 (14) identified six distinct clinicopathological variants of sCJD, which appeared to be specified largely by the genotype at codon 129 and the physiochemical properties of PrPSc.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	9	 More recently, an extensive analysis, which included the metal ion-dependent conformation of PrPSc, of a large number of sCJD cases showed that PrPSc types are associated with the residue encoded at codon 129, the duration of illness, and with neuropathological phenotype (15).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	10	 PrPSc types 1 and 4 have so far been detected only in Met129 homozygotes, type 4 being uniquely associated with vCJD, type 3 in cases containing a Val129 allele, and type 2 in any PRNP codon 129 genotype (16).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The codon 129 polymorphism seemed to modulate the pattern of neuropathology and the extent of lesions in sCJD, as shown in a study that involved 70 patients who died in France between 1994 and 1998 (17).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Codon 129 polymorphism also has epistatic effects on the phenotypic effects of mutations elsewhere in the prion gene.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For example, the Asp178 Gln mutation combined with a methionine at position 129 results in fatal familial insomnia (18).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In contrast, the same mutation with a valine encoded at position 129 results in familial CJD (19).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Similarly, Val129 homozygotes in association with the Phe198 Ser mutation predispose patients to the Indiana kindred variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (20).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, an increased prevalence of genotype Val/Val at the polymorphic site 129 has been described in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (21) and a shift in cognitive decline toward early age in carriers of PRNP129 Val/Val has been reported recently (22).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	17	Despite the clear importance of the polymorphism at codon 129 in the PRNP gene and its link to disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which these effects are mediated remain unclear.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The in vitro, thermodynamic stability of recombinant PrP is not affected by the Met129 Val mutation or by other substitutions related to inherited human prion diseases (23).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Structural studies, however, have shown evidence for hydrogen bonding between residues 128 and 178, which might provide a structural basis for the highly specific influence of polymorphism in position 129 on disease phenotype that segregates with Asp178 Gln (24).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Molecular dynamic simulations of low pH-induced conformational conversion of PrP has provided further clues as to the role of residue 129 (25).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In these simulations, Met129 seems to interact with Val122 leading to the recruitment of more N-proximal residues into an expanding -sheet.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	22	 As a complementary approach, we have chosen to study the folding properties of the two PrP allelomorphs experimentally by examining the misfolding pathway that leads to the formation of -sheet-rich oligomeric isoforms (26).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We show that PrP-Met129 has a higher propensity to form -sheet-rich oligomers, whereas PrP-Val129 has a higher tendency to fold into -helical-rich monomers.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We also provide evidence that the dynamics of maturation of the oligomers differ between the two variants.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The maturation process occurs over time at the expense of the -helical-like monomers at a faster rate for PrP-Met129 than for PrP-Val129.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Once the oligomers from either allelomorph have been formed they show similar proteinase K resistance that does not change throughout the oligomer maturation process.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The observed differences in the misfolding of PrP-Met129 and PrP-Val129 could explain the high susceptibility of individuals that are methionine homozygote to sporadic as well as variant CJD.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The disappearance of aggregated proteins from peak I occurred more rapidly in the Met129 variant than in the Val129 variant, which suggests that, under oligomer-promoting conditions, the aggregated material from PrP-Met129 has a higher propensity to convert into oligomer than aggregated protein from PrP-Val129.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	102	 To test this, we took aggregated proteins from peak I of PrP-Met129 and PP-Val129 from SEC at time 0 and monitored their evolution over time by re-injecting them onto the same SEC.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Time course comparison between the two allelomorphes clearly demonstrated the higher propensity of the Met129 variant to oligomerize than the Val129 variant (see supplementary Fig.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	105	 To investigate the behavior of monomeric species in peak III under the same oligomeric-promoting conditions, we compared the rate of oligomerization of the Met129 variant to that of the Val129 variant collected from SEC at time 0.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Time course comparison between the two allelomorphs clearly revealed that monomeric Met129 has a higher propensity to oligomerize than monomeric Val129.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This difference in oligomerization rates was apparent after 2 days of incubation at room temperature (see supplementary Fig.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	108	From these data we conclude that, under these conditions, the Met129 variant has an intrinsically higher propensity to form oligomer isoforms than the Val129.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The high oligomerization propensity of the methionine variant becomes even more apparent under the highest protein concentration and rapid refolding conditions.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Since this is true for denatured, aggregated, or natively folded monomeric protein, the higher propensity of oligomerization is clearly independent of the starting state of the protein.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	138	  Two important observations can be clearly made from reversed-phase chromatograms.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	139	 First, the proportions of the two forms of PrP-Met129 and PrP-Val129 were different; the proportion of protein eluting in peak IIa was higher for PrP-Met129 after 12 days of incubation (Fig.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	140	 3, A versus B), while for PrP-Val129 there was more protein that eluted in peak IIb.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Second, the proportions of the two peaks changed over time at different rates for Met129 and Val129 variants.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In particular, the proportion of protein eluting in peak IIb decreased at a higher rate in the oligomer of PrP-Met129 (Fig.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Peak IIb of the oligomer from both allelomorphs seemed to have a retention time similar to that of the corresponding -helical monomers.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Because RP-HPLC uses differences in the hydrophobic properties to achieve separation between bio-molecules, it can be concluded that the protein population present in the highly retained peak IIb has more surface-exposed hydrophobic residues than the protein population present in peak IIa.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Furthermore, the protein population present in peak IIb appears to undergo conversion to become recruited into the population that eluted in peak IIa.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Over time, this conversion seemed to occur much quicker with PrP-Met129 than with PrP-Val129 (Fig.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	148	Because of the long storage time of both allelomorphs in SEC elution buffer at room temperature, we have used mass spectrometry to assess the integrity of the samples (see supplementary Fig.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	149	 After 2 and 12 days of oligomerization, both allelomorphs had molecular masses that matched those predicted from the amino acid sequences.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, after 30 days of oligomerization, the deconvoluted mass spectra of both variants showed an additional species with a molecular mass that corresponded to the cleavage of the N-terminal two residues from the proteins (see supplementary Fig.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	188	Our experimental data show that, under conditions that favor rapid formation of oligomers, SEC can be used to partition protein folded into aggregated, monomeric and oligomeric states so that differences in folding of Met129 and Val129 variants become clear.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It has been shown that folding of recombinant, murine prion protein into -helix-rich conformation is extremely rapid (41) and is under kinetic control (28).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We show in this work that the propensity of recombinant human prion protein to fold into monomeric -helical-rich population is increased when residue 129 was occupied by a valine.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, when the same position is occupied by methionine a tendency for oligomerization can be observed, with comparatively little monomeric -helical-rich population.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These differences in folding behavior can be explained by a fundamental event in protein folding, which is driven by a small number of specific residues involved in the formation of a well defined, specific nucleus that then allows the rest of the structure to coalesce efficiently around it (42, 43).
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The high -sheet propensity of valine residues as compared with methionine residues (44, 45) makes PrP in which valine is present at residue 129 more favorable to adopt the native local -sheet that would temporarily stabilize the Val129 allelomorph in the monomeric -helical PrP.

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Over the course of several weeks of incubation, the oligomerization process in both variants occurred at the expense of the -helical-like population that became a substrate for oligomer recruitment (28, 46).

0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	210	 We found that once oligomers from both allelomorphs are formed they show similar proteinase K resistance that does not change throughout the oligomer maturation process.
0.10508279.15131108.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This indicates that if one relies solely on PK digestion to investigate PrP conformations, one could miss the detection of dynamic conformational changes influenced by the polymorphism at codon 129 in human PrP during disease pathogenesis.

0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	2	In Portugal, despite the completion of previous scrapie surveillance plans, both at the clinical and histopathological levels, as yet no scrapie cases have been diagnosed.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The absence of scrapie in Portugal cannot be attributed to a genetic basis and the possibility has been suggested for subclinical or other forms of scrapie strains to be present (Orge et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In this study, as a result of the EU active scrapie surveillance plan, we have identified the first cases of sheep with detectable PrPres deposition in the central nervous system (CNS) in Portugal.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	5	Since its implementation in 2002 (according to EU regulation 999/2001 and subsequent alterations) until February 2004, a total of 30 269 sheep over 18 months of age were screened for the presence of PrPres in the brainstem by the Bio-Rad rapid test done according to manufacturer's instructions.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	6	 All the cases that tested positive by the rapid test had been selected for human consumption.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These cases were analysed further for the presence of vacuolation by histopathology, for the deposition of PrPres by immunohistochemistry and for the analysis of the PrPres electrophoretic profile by Western immunoblotting, and the Prnp (codons 136, 154 and 171) genotypes were also determined.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Brainstems were divided sagittally with one half frozen for rapid test analysis, Western immunoblotting and DNA extraction, and the other half fixed in 10 % saline formalin and processed for routine paraffin histology.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	9	 For immunohistochemistry, three anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies, 2G11 (Institute Pourquier-Farmoquil), SAF84 (SPI-bio) and L42 (RIDA; R-Biopharm), were used in three confirmatory independent assays essentially as previously described (Orge et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For 2G11, sections were pretreated with formic acid followed by autoclaving.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the case of SAF84 and L42, sections were, in addition to formic acid treatment, pretreated with proteinase K as described previously (Bencsik et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The specificity of PrPres immunolabelling was controlled using sections from known scrapie-positive [kindly supplied by the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) archive] and scrapie-negative cases.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For Western immunoblotting analysis of PrPres, frozen brainstem tissue was processed according to a new protocol from Bio-Rad developed for ovine tissues.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For Prnp genotyping, genomic DNA extracted from frozen brainstem tissue was subjected to PCR with Prnp specific primers (upper and lower primers: 321 to 340 and 572 to 590 nt, respectively, according to GenBank accession no.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	15	 AF180389) to yield an amplicon that encompassed codons 136, 154 and 171.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	16	 PCR products were then submitted to automated cycle sequencing in both orientations using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer).
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	17	As a result of the rapid test screening, seven sheep slaughtered for human consumption that tested positive for the presence of PrPres (Table 1) were confirmed for the deposition of PrPres in the brainstem at the level of the obex, both by us and the VLA despite the absence of obvious vacuolation.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	18	 All cases showed the same granular PrPres deposition in the neuropil of the spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (STN V) (Fig.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Remarkably, no PrPres deposition could be detected in the neuropil of the dorsal vagal nucleus (DVN) (Fig.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	20	 1a, d, g and j), which is the neuronal nucleus that is always associated with PrPres deposition in scrapie.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In three sheep (Table 1; cases 4, 6 and 7), focal granular immunostaining in the neuropil of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) was also observed (Fig.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This distribution is unusual because of the consistent absence of detectable PrPres in the DVN and the deposition in the STN V.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In scrapie, it has been extensively reported that the DVN is the first CNS nucleus to show vacuolation and PrPres deposition (Andreoletti et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1997), hence, is the elected nucleus used for routine diagnosis.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, the distribution of PrPres deposition obtained with three different anti-PrP specific antibodies was atypical in all seven cases reported here.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently, scrapie cases have been reported that also diverged phenotypically from typical scrapie (Benestad et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In particular, in several atypical scrapie cases that have been reported in Norway, PrPres deposition was observed in the cerebellum, midbrain and cerebral cortex, but no PrPres could be detected in the obex region (Benestad et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In these cases, designated Nor98, although inconsistently, PrPres deposition was also detected in the STN V.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These findings are consistent with those described here in that no PrPres could be detected in the DVN.

0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Specific PrPres signal was visualized with the StreptABC-alkaline phosphatase, New Fuchsin system (DAKO) and tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer's Haematoxylin.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	41	  We next sought to evaluate the electrophoretic profile of the PrPres in the cases reported here.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Frozen brainstem tissue was pretreated with proteinase K and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for the detection of PrPres (Fig.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We have analysed four of seven cases for which we had sufficient frozen brainstem tissue available.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This analysis revealed that the profile of the PrPres electrophoretic mobility was equivalent in all cases and ranged from 30 to 12 kDa.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This result was consistent with the observation that all seven cases presented the same pattern of PrPres distribution in the brainstem.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Moreover, coherent with a putative atypical form of scrapie, the PrPres electrophoretic mobility in all cases analysed ranged from 30 to 12 kDa clearly distinct from that usually observed for scrapie, which ranges from 30 to 19 kDa (Fig.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	47	, 1999) and BSE in experimentally inoculated sheep, which ranges from 29 to 18 4 kDa (Stack et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Significantly, the PrPres electrophoretic profile described here was of the same range and pattern as that described for Nor98 (Benestad et al.

0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	54	 A known scrapie-negative sample was used as negative control (neg).
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	55	  Notably, four of seven cases reported here had genotypes rarely associated with scrapie, including one animal homozygous for ARR (Table 1).
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Susceptibility to clinically apparent scrapie is determined by polymorphisms in Prnp, particularly at codons 136 (A, V or T), 154 (R or H) and 171 (Q, R, H or K).
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Genotypes with VRQ and ARQ alleles are linked to a higher susceptibility to scrapie, whereas, genotypes with AHQ and ARR alleles are linked to a lower susceptibility and increased resistance to scrapie (Billinis et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Under experimental conditions, polymorphisms in Prnp have also been shown to influence the transmission of BSE to sheep, with the allele ARQ being associated with a shorter incubation period and ARR with increased resistance (Foster et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, successful transmission of BSE by the intracerebral route to homozygous ARR sheep has been reported recently (Houston et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	60	, 2003) and other recently reported scrapie cases in Europe (Buschmann et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	61	, 2004), the cases reported here can also be considered as atypical.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Thus far, all cases of sheep with PrPres deposition in the CNS identified in Portugal are from sheep with no apparent clinical disease and came from flocks dispersed throughout the country.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Notably, of the 30 269 sheep tested none showed a pattern of PrPres deposition coherent with typical scrapie.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This finding is consistent with the fact that to date no clinical scrapie has been diagnosed in Portugal.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Thus, it is not clear if the cases described in this study represent an endemic form of a prion disease in sheep not previously identified and not linked to any specific Prnp genotypes or represent a recently acquired new form of scrapie.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	66	In order to gain further insight into the epidemiological and public health relevance of this apparent atypical scrapie, it is extremely important to show if it is transmissible and assess if it constitutes a new scrapie strain like Nor98.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The occurrence of such a putative atypical scrapie strain, independently of the Prnp genotype, may be of significance for current EU sheep breeding programmes for selection of non-susceptible haplotypes.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Furthermore, given the recent BSE epidemic in Portugal (Donnelly et al.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	69	, 1999), and thus the geographical risk of transmission of BSE into sheep, a possible link to BSE cannot be excluded.
0.11211797.15483267.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Although, we cannot rule out the possibility of adaptation of BSE in sheep following natural transmission, the fact that the PrPres electrophoretic profile described for this putative atypical scrapie strain is distinct from that observed in BSE experimentally infected sheep, makes this link less probable.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	4	The c-myc gene encodes a transcription factor, c-Myc, that dimerizes with Max to serve as a master regulator of cell growth, cell division, and cell differentiation in all metazoans (reviewed in Ref.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Mutations that disrupt the regulated expression of c-myc (or the related N-myc and L-myc genes) are common, causative lesions in many human and animal cancers (2).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In addition to its prominent link to cancer, myc is also required for timely progression through the cell cycle and is an essential downstream effector of mitogenic signals (3-5).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The Myc family proteins function as transactivators when assayed on reporter constructs containing consensus binding sites or when the Myc N terminus is tethered to DNA through a heterologous DNA binding domain (6, 7).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recognition of specific chromosomal targets primarily involves the basic region, which forms an extended -helix with helix 1 in the Max homodimer crystal structure (8, 9).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Myc/Max heterodimers recognize a preferred consensus site ACCACGTGGT, although other related sites are also bound with varying affinity (10-12).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains dictate the highly specific dimerization of Myc with Max, which prevents dimerization with numerous other transcription factors that have related HLH1 and/or leucine zipper motifs (13).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	11	 An increasing number of cellular targets for Myc/Max heterodimers have been defined (14) with compelling evidence that Myc protein can be cross-linked to target sites in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (15-18).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	12	More recently, the Max superfamily was extended to include the Mad and Mxi proteins that form alternate heterodimers with Max (reviewed in Ref.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Unlike Myc, Mad/Mxi proteins function as repressors of transcription and inhibitors of both cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (20-22).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Mad/Max heterodimers recognize consensus binding sites in vitro that are indistinguishable from those recognized by Myc/Max, suggesting that these alternate Max complexes may activate and repress common target genes.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although this is an appealing model, there remains only limited evidence to support it.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Whereas Myc protein is expressed in all proliferating cells, Mad protein expression is more restricted and primarily found in terminally differentiated cells (23-26).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus, in mitogen-deprived cells where Myc levels are low, there is no evidence that Mad supplants Myc to repress target genes.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Some specific gene promoters, tert and cyclinD2, have been shown to bind to Mad1 protein in vivo, using HL60 cells, which differentiate and express high enough levels of Mad protein to cross-link (16, 18).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In undifferentiated cells that express Myc rather than Mad, Myc was bound to the same promoters, suggesting that Myc and Mad can bind sequentially to common promoters.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, these are isolated examples so far, and no other promoters were examined.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Further support for antagonistic functions of Myc and Mad/Mxi comes from mouse gene knockout experiments in which Mad and Mxi knockouts exhibit minor hyperproliferative disorders or occasional tumors, suggesting that these genes can function as tumor suppressors (27-29).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, no homozygous mutations in mad or mxi genes have been found in human or animal cancers to establish any direct role for these proteins as tumor suppressors.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	23	Previous studies compared Myc and Mxi/Mad binding with cellular promoters through either the introduction of Mad/Mxi1-specific amino acid substitutions into the Myc basic region or the complete substitution of the Mad1 basic/HLH/LZ region into Myc (30, 31).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Since the basic region is responsible (when dimerized with Max) for the recognition of DNA sequence elements at chromosomal sites, it was suggested that these mutants would offer insight into Myc versus Mad/Mxi target gene recognition and biological function.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	25	 One study noted a substantial decrease in the transforming activity of the Myc(Mxi1-BR) exchange mutants and a shift in the spectrum of genes regulated in human fibroblasts (30).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	26	 From this, it was suggested that the biological activities of Myc and Mxi1 involve the regulation of both common and distinct sets of target genes governing diverse biological processes.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A second study with a complete B/HLH/LZ exchange came to the different conclusion that DNA binding activity and target gene regulation in terms of cell proliferation were similar for the Myc and Mad1 proteins but that the induction of apoptosis was substantially different (31).

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	72	 To dissect the contribution of the basic DNA recognition domain alone, we decided to test the DNA binding activity of the Myc and Mad basic regions through functional assays.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	73	 A comparison of the basic regions of the Myc and Mad/Mxi families is shown in Fig.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The Myc and Mad/Mxi basic regions are both bounded by proline or glycine, which are likely positions for a domain boundary.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Given these structural considerations, we decided to test the Mad basic region function by exchanging 24 amino acids of mouse c-Myc with 21 amino acids of mouse Mad1, using an N-terminal proline as one boundary and an invariant leucine in helix 1 as the C-terminal boundary.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Since the proliferative and oncogenic activities of c-Myc are presumably a manifestation of the complex sets of target genes that it regulates, we infer that all of the critical functional targets recognized by the c-Myc basic domain are also recognized by the Mad basic domain.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	146	In this study, we have conducted a thorough analysis of the DNA recognition properties of the Myc and Mad1 basic regions.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	147	 We conclude that there is no measurable difference in DNA site recognition in vivo between the Myc and Mad1 basic regions, and therefore, that these two domains can recognize equivalent sets of target genes.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The precise fusion proteins that we analyzed and their resulting biological activities differ significantly from two previous reports (30, 31) that addressed similar questions.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	150	Our conclusions differ most significantly from a previous study by O'Hagan et al.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	151	 (30) that attempted to create a Mxi-like basic region within Myc through the mutation of 2-4 amino acids in the Myc basic region to those found at the corresponding positions in Mxi (and Mad) proteins.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The most disruptive mutation in this study was R357S (numbered from the human c-Myc initiation methionine), which changes one of the basic amino acids in Myc into a non-basic residue.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It seems quite possible that target gene recognition by Myc is dependent on an extended set of basic amino acids within this region, and thus, this mutation debilitates Myc function.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The basic region exchange used in our study included two additional basic amino acids farther toward the N terminus.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We speculate that these amino acids provide important nonspecific DNA interactions with the phosphate backbone to increase target gene recognition in vivo.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	156	 It is also possible that other conformational aspects of the Mad1 basic region are preserved in the more extended Mad/Myc exchange.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This interpretation is supported by the partial restoration of transforming activity in the Myc(R357S/V361E) double mutant, which exchanges two positions of the Myc basic region with the corresponding residues from Mxi1 and Mad1 (30).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The indistinguishable transforming and proliferative activity of the Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) exchange mutant in our study argues that the basic regions of Myc and Mad1 can recognize the same critical target genes in vivo.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	159	Our findings also contrast a more recent report that the Myc and Mad1 B/HLH/LZ domains differ in apoptotic potential but not in proliferative activity (31).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We find that the c-Myc and Myc(Mad-BR) proteins induce indistinguishable levels of apoptosis, implying that these two proteins activate or repress the same target genes that promote apoptosis in the absence of survival factors.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The simplest explanation for the differences between the two studies is the potential contribution of the HLH/LZ domain to biological activity since our study exchanged only the extended basic region and not the entire DNA binding/Max dimerization domain.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Structural studies imply that the helix 1 and loop domains can affect DNA binding activity (37, 38), although no differences in DNA binding between WT c-Myc and the Mad bHZ exchange were found using in vitro assays (31).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Of more interest are reported differences in protein interactions with the HLH/LZ domains, where Myc can bind to Miz1 and Mad1 cannot (39).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We also note a significant difference in the ability of the previously described bHZ exchange protein to rescue the growth defect in Myc-null cells.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We find indistinguishable cell doubling times for Myc and Myc(Mad-BR), whereas the growth rate for the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange was less than for WT c-Myc (31).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Even greater differences were found in the rescue of the cell cycle defect.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In the Myc(MadbHZ) study, 48% of cells were in G1 for the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange when compared with 58% for Myc-null cells and 28-29% for both Myc reconstituted and parental Rat1 cells (31).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Similarly, the S phase fraction was 25% for Myc-null, 43% for WT c-Myc, and 37% for Myc(MadbHZ).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In contrast, we find indistinguishable profiles for G1-S-G2/M between Myc and Myc(Mad-BR), similar to the results for cell doubling time.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Thus, the Myc(MadbHZ) exchange protein only rescues part of the growth defect in Myc-null cells.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	171	 These differences between our study and the bHZ exchange study may be attributable to specific protein-protein interactions with the HLH and/or LZ domains rather than to any differences in target gene recognition.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It is also possible that the defect in apoptosis noted in the Myc(MadbHZ) mutant is coupled to the defect in cell cycle rescue.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	173	The most important question that remains unresolved is whether or not Myc and Mad/Mxi regulate the same target genes under normal developmental conditions.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Our study provides the most extensive evidence to date for the direct binding of Myc and Mad1 to the same target genes in vivo.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Since the endogenous Myc and Mad/Mxi proteins differ in antibody reactivity, it is impossible to provide an accurate quantitative assessment of the relative binding efficiency of each protein at individual targets, and it is also difficult to assess the activity of each protein once binding has occurred.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, in the differentiating HL60 cells that we studied, Mad1 binds to all of the Myc target genes we tested under the differentiated/growth arrest conditions where Mad1 is induced.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	177	Our data support a model in which Myc/Max and Mad/Max heterodimers recognize equivalent target genes in vivo.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The primary biological difference between these complexes is their precise regulation and their recruitment of nuclear cofactors, i.

0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Mad/Mxi family proteins are mainly expressed at distinct stages of development and differentiation, almost all of which are associated with growth arrest.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	181	 An exception to this is the nearly ubiquitous expression of Mxi1 and the S phase-specific expression of Mad3.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In addition, Mxi1-deficient primary cells have a higher colony-forming ability when plated at low density, suggesting an enhanced proliferative capacity (27).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In contrast, Myc proteins are expressed in all dividing cells and repressed under virtually all growth arrest conditions.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Thus, in many cells, target genes will be down-regulated in non-dividing cells by the absence of Myc activation but not through active repression by Mad/Mxi.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Furthermore, we note that most Myc target genes are still expressed basally even in the complete absence of Myc, such as in Myc-null fibroblasts (33, 40).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This Myc-independent target gene expression is likely due to promoter elements that bind other nuclear factors, and the Myc-dependent induction of its targets is usually quite modest (3-fold) in log phase cells (33, 40).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	187	 One factor with a potential role in this system is Mnt, which is simultaneously expressed in dividing cells with Myc.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Mnt can bind the Sin3A corepressor and block Myc function (41), and Mnt/Max complexes are significantly more abundant than Myc/Max complexes in nuclear extracts (26, 42).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It is not known whether Mnt/Max heterodimers constitutively repress Myc target genes and act to down-regulate their expression when Myc is repressed.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Moreover, induction of Mad/Mxi under conditions where Myc is already down-regulated may recruit additional repressive cofactors to shut down target gene promoters below their level of basal transcription.
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Yet another complication in this system is the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) transcription factor, which has been shown to bind to many Myc/Max binding sites under conditions when Myc is not expressed (43).
0.11612061.12538578.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Our data are consistent with a model in which all Myc target genes can be suppressed by Mad/Mxi when the latter proteins are induced in development and/or differentiation.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, there is concern that some sCJD cases could be secondary to environmental exposure, case-to-case transmission, or unnoticed food chain contamination, as suggested by the occurrence of atypical phenotypes, spatiotemporal disease clusters (12), and the increased incidence of the disorder recently observed in Switzerland (13).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Because of the variability in clinical presentation, signs at evolution, and neuropathological changes, the disorder with the double eponym Creutzfeldt-Jakob should be properly called syndrome rather than disease.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Different sCJD phenotypes largely correlate with the PRNP codon 129 genotype, a site of methionine or valine polymorphism, and distinct PrPSc types (14) currently classified according to the molecular mass of their PrP27-30 core fragment in turn reflect the tertiary structure of PrPSc.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, controversial results have been obtained by different authors who have proposed the classification of sCJD PrP27-30 into two (14) and four types (15).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Two main limitations of these studies are (i) the use of a relatively crude technique of protein separation, such as SDS-PAGE, and (ii) the detection of PrP species with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal 109-112 epitope, which precludes the recognition of PrP molecules lacking this region.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	12	Here we studied 32 subjects, with definite sCJD of all genotypes at PRNP codon 129 and with different PrPSc types, to characterize C-terminal PrPSc fragments in distinct disease phenotypes and host genotypes.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	45	 1B, lanes 1 and 3); a band with similar electrophoretic mobility was barely detectable also in MM cases with type 2 PrPSc (MM2) (data not shown).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The 16-17-kDa C-terminal fragment was found in untreated brain homogenates and partially recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These biochemical features, combined with the absence of this fragment in normal brains, suggest that this truncated form is mainly generated by an aberrant endogenous PrPSc cleavage.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	48	In marked contrast, following PK digestion and immunoblot with 6H4, sCJD brains from subjects MV and VV at codon 129 and with type 2 PrPSc contained only the PrPSc triplet (Fig.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	54	 1C, lane 3), whereas in MV2 and VV2 subjects (Fig.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	55	 1C, lane 2), fewer truncated fragments were seen, migrating at 18- and 12-kDa zones after PNGase and PK treatment (Fig.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	56	Effect of pH on PrP27-30 and on Truncated PrP Fragments In a previous study, we observed that one type of PrPSc, detected in the classical form of sCJD, changes its conformation after exposure to acidic and basic pH values (18).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	57	 This property, likely dependent on the presence of octapeptide repeats in the PrPSc molecule, enabled us to distinguish two PrPSc types that share an identical electrophoretic mobility after solubilization in lysis buffer at pH 7.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Following immunoblot with 3F4, the PK-resistant fragment of 21 kDa, detected in 9 MM subjects and in 1 VV case, migrated slower at pH 5 as compared with the migration observed when samples were solubilized at pH 8 (Table I).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In contrast, PrPSc migration was not consistently modified in 6 MM, 1 MV, and 1 VV cases with type 1 PrP27-30 and in all cases with type 2 PrP27-30.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	60	 To further clarify the influence of the octapeptide region in determining sensitivity to pH, brain homogenates from each single case of the group sensitive to pH were exposed to consecutive PK digestions, first to acidic and subsequently to basic pH.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	61	 As expected, the immunoblots with 6H4 showed that, at acidic pH, the main fragment migrated at 22.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	62	5 kDa, and following further digestion at pH 8, it was detected in a 20-kDa zone because of the effect of an additional cleavage.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Immunoblots with SP-214, recognizing the 214-231 C-terminal sequence of human PrP, showed similar results (data not shown) thus suggesting that the 22.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Conversely, the electrophoretic migration of the C-terminal fragment of 16-17 kDa was unaffected by serial acidic and basic digestion procedures (Fig.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	66	 1D, lanes 1 and 2), confirming the role of the octapeptide region in conferring PrPSc susceptibility to conformational changes.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	67	Two-dimensional mapping of PrP isoforms in control and sCJD brains Recently, we provided a detailed two-dimensional mapping of PrPC glycoforms by using the 3F4 antibody, recognizing a linear epitope expressed in the full-length PrPC and in the C2 fragment (17).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	68	 When analyzing PrPC in two dimensions, the customary di-, mono-, and unglycosylated bands of the protein, obtained after SDS-PAGE, are separated in several spots according to two independent features: the isoelectric point (which reflects the net charge) and the mobility (determined by the molecular mass).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, after two-dimensional separation, each spot can be assigned to glycosylated or unglycosylated species based on its shape, configuration, tail, and smear.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Although the 6H4 antibody was unable to detect PrPC molecules after two-dimensional separation of control brain homogenates, the SP-214 monoclonal antibody revealed several glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP forms with faster migrating species being detected at 18 kDa, corresponding to unglycosylated C1 isoforms (Fig.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Negative results obtained with 6H4 suggest that this antibody recognizes a conformational rather than a linear PrP epitope and that this epitope is lost after solubilization of PrP in high molar urea.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	72	 After PNGase treatment, truncated PrPC glycoforms were all reduced into several spots migrating at 20- and 18-kDa zones (Fig.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	73	 2B), corresponding to PrP fragments referred to as C2 and C1, respectively.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Differing from controls, each single homogenate of cortical areas, subcortical nuclei, and cerebellum from sCJD brains showed increased amounts of C2 (migrating at 21 kDa in cases with type 1 PrPSc and 19 kDa in those with type 2 PrPSc) and the presence of additional acidic PrP glycoforms and low molecular mass unglycosylated species.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Immunoblot with SP-214 of PK-resistant PrP molecules shows additional unglycosylated PrP spots migrating at 16-17 and 12-14 kDa, in all sCJD subjects with type 1 PrP27-30 (B, D, F); barely detectable spots with an identical migration pattern as those associated with type 1 PrP27-30 are also seen in MM2 subjects (H).

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	112	  In the MM2C group, the 3F4 antibody showed differently glycosylated forms of PrP27-30 (Fig.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	115	Finally, in the MV2 and VV2 groups, major 3F4-positive glycoforms of 29, 25, and 19 kDa (Fig.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	120	These results indicate that in MV2 and VV2 cases, glycosylated C1 isoforms acquire PK-resistance, although the possibility that C1-sized fragments are generated upon protease treatment cannot be ruled out.

0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	129	Using sensitive protein separation techniques and Western blot with antibodies recognizing the C-terminal globular domain of prion protein, we have identified new protease-resistant PrP species in brain homogenates from sCJD subjects.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	130	 These new fragments, detected in the mass interval between 16 and 18 kDa, showed two distinct and highly reproducible electrophoretic patterns, each segregating preferentially with type 1 or type 2 PrP27-30.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The electrophoretic migration of these newly identified PK-resistant PrP products is, therefore, intermediate between the unglycosylated PrP27-30 fragment (which is currently used to classify molecular PrPSc types) and the 12-14 kDa PrP molecules observed in all sCJD subtypes and named CTF 12/13 (9).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The immunoblot detection of low molecular mass PrP fragments in untreated whole brain homogenates from sCJD subjects indicates that such fragments are generated by an endogenous proteolytic mechanism.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It should also be emphasized that the detergent insolubility of these molecules and the lack of shift in their apparent molecular weight after PK digestion support the view that these PrP species adopt a fully protease-resistant conformation in vivo.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	134	Taken together, the present findings point out that multiple abnormal PrP conformers are expressed during the spreading of sCJD strains.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This could result from diverse subcellular sites of formation or, alternatively, from the generation of PrP conformers from full-length and N-terminally truncated PrPC precursors.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Furthermore, the identification of the 16-17- and 12-14-kDa forms in subjects of all genotypes with type 1 or MM with type 2 PrPSc suggests that the mechanism involved in the formation of these forms is not influenced by codon 129 and by the type of PrP27-30.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Although the three classes of PrP fragments characterized in the present study show biochemical properties of pathological PrP, it remains to be determined if they maintain all of the biological properties of PrPSc.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	138	A further implication of the identification of 16-17-kDa forms is related to the molecular classification of PrPSc types encountered in sCJD.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The influence of several experimental conditions, including pH and EDTA concentration, on the conformation of type 1 PrPSc and, therefore, on its electrophoretic migration is well known (18, 19).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	140	 On this basis, we propose the use of conventional Western blot with 6H4 antibody, which is able to detect an accompanying fragment of 16-17 kDa in all cases with type 1 PrPSc.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Such a standardized molecular classification of sCJD would have major implications for epidemiological studies, whereas more sophisticated investigations, such as two-dimensional mapping and PrP sequencing, should be reserved for atypical cases.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	142	To date, the existence of distinct strains of the agent responsible for human prion diseases has been difficult to explain with just the biochemical findings of two main PrP27-30 conformations and with microsequencing analyses showing two truncation patterns in sporadic, inherited, and acquired diseases (21).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It is well known that glycans may play a role in the phenotypic determination of some prion conditions, and their role has been recently proposed to explain differences between sporadic fatal insomnia and MM2 sCJD, two conditions sharing PrP27-30 type and PRNP codon 129 (22).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, different glycosylation states of PrPSc cannot fully account for prion diversity.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Recent transmission studies of sCJD to transgenic mice show three distinct incubation periods of different sCJD subtypes (23).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In particular, inocula from subjects MM1 and MV1 have the same incubation times, and, therefore, these molecular types appear as a homogeneous group.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	147	 MV2 and VV2 cases, when transmitted to mice with Val at position 129, induce the disease at the same post-inoculum intervals and thus suggesting similar biological properties of these sCJD strains.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	148	 On the other hand, MM2 inocula show heterogeneous transmission properties and incubation times different from the above groups.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	149	Based on the biochemical patterns obtained by combining the PrP27-30 core fragment and lower truncated PrP species, here we show three distinct groups of disease-associated PrP species in sCJD with type 1 PrPSc, MM2 subjects, and MV2/VV2 cases.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Strikingly, similar molecular groups of PrP species are obtained by Satoh et al.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	151	 (8) when combining truncated fragments of 11-12 kDa with type 1 and type 2 PrP27-30.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Whether the present biochemical findings represent a molecular basis for different biological properties of the above sCJD strains remains to be determined.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	153	Despite the recognition of conformational variants of disease-associated PrP species in experimental and naturally occurring prion diseases, little is known about the influence of different molecules on disease phenotype (24).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Although it is commonly believed that PrP27-30 has a major role in modulating sCJD phenotype, it would be of interest to learn whether different truncated PrPs are related to specific clinical and pathological traits.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Previous studies have disclosed that an internal PrP fragment of 7-8 kDa detected in patients with P102L Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (7, 25) and a C-terminal fragment associated with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease due to E200K mutation (26) are toxic to neurons in combination with or in the absence of PrP expression (27, 28).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Here we have found that a fully glycosylated PrP fragment, closely matching the C1 PrPC fragment, was associated with amyloid plaques in MV2 cases and plaque-like PrP deposits in VV2 subjects.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	157	 On the contrary, C1 PrPSc was not observed in sCJD subtypes lacking extracellular PrP deposition.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	158	 It is noteworthy to emphasize that we also determined2 the presence of C1 PrPSc in subjects with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a condition characterized by florid PrP amyloid plaques) as well as in the newly identified bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE) (3) but not in amyloid-free typical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Earlier studies have shown that C1 is a cell surface glycophosphoinositol-anchored protein starting at amino acid 110/111 in human neuroblastoma cells (6) and present under multiple truncation forms in brain tissue (17).
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	160	 According to our findings, it is conceivable that extracellular release of C1 PrPSc could be responsible for PrP deposition and aggregation, as observed in MV2 and VV2 sCJD subtypes.
0.11677446.15247220.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Altogether, these results show that PrP-truncated fragments may influence the disease phenotype of sCJD and that their characterization is important for the molecular definition of sCJD subtypes.

0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	3	These findings are well established and have driven therapeutics research, especially because they have allowed the development of animal models of these diseases as well as defined therapeutic targets (7).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	6	By studying the autosomal dominant forms of these and other diseases, researchers hope to gain insight into the more common, sporadic forms, and from a mechanistic perspective, this has certainly been the case.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, perhaps more surprisingly, over this last 4 years, it has become clear that, in the case of many of these diseases at least, the haplotype of the Mendelian pathogenic locus influences the disease risk for sporadic disease.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	8	In this review, we briefly summarise these data, and then make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	9	 First, though, it is worth noting what a  haplotypic association  means from a mechanistic perspective: in the absence of coding changes, a haplotypic association implies there is genetic variability either in the amount of expression of the protein, or in the alternate splicing of the protein, and that this contributes to disease risk.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	10	Alzheimer's disease Extensive sequencing of the APP gene in late-onset Alzheimer's disease has failed to identify mutations (13).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).

0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	16	 There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	17	 There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	22	Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia Mutations in the -synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, and -synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathognomic feature of Parkinson's disease (25).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Genetic variability in the -synuclein promoter contributes to the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (26,27) with the  associated  promoter allele being a stronger promoter (28).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	27	While these findings were unexpected, perhaps they should not have been.
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	28	 All chemists know the power of the law of mass action, and perhaps it should not have surprised us that it may have profound implications in determining our risks of neurodegenerative disease (36).
0.11926218.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Of course, one therapeutic approach in all cases, therefore, would be to aim to reduce the concentrations of the toxic proteins in the relevant tissue compartment either through decreased production, increased breakdown, or both.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	9	Abbreviations used in this paper: ss-lactoglobulin; ss-LG; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; Treg cell, regulatory T cell.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	10	Decreased robustness of mucosally induced tolerance in "westernized" populations is suggested by the recent striking rise of atopic diseases (4), and some 5 to 8% of children up to 3 yr of age now develop food allergy.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This disorder is associated with serious health consequences and may unfortunately also be the starting point for an "allergic march," i.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	12	, the development of subsequent atopic diseases in the airways.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the immunological mechanisms involved in break of oral tolerance against dietary antigens.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	14	Indirect evidence exists to suggest that the development of food allergy may be controlled by CD4+CD25+ Treg cells.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Patients with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome, or X-linked autoimmunity-allergic dysregulation syndrome lack this T cell subset, and they often develop food allergic reactions and increased specific IgE antibody levels accompanied by severe eczema (5, 6).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further support for a role of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in mediating oral tolerance has been obtained from feeding experiments in mice (7 to 11).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Other T cell subsets possibly involved in oral tolerance, at least in animals, are Th3 cells which produce TGF-ss, Tr1 cells which produce IL-10, and TGF-ss and NK T cells (12 to 14).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, it is not firmly established whether all these subsets represent separate cell lineages or different maturational phenotypes.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	19	A few years after the discovery of naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in mice, a similar T cell subset has been identified in human peripheral blood, thymus, LNs, and cord blood (15).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In mice, the CD4+CD25+ Treg cells reportedly play a role in the control of immune responses to infectious agents, transplants, and cancer as well as in graft-versus-host reactions (16 to 21), whereas in humans CD4+CD25+ Treg cells have been shown to be involved in regulating cancer immunity (22 to 24).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These human cells are typically anergic upon TCR stimulation (25), although recent studies in mice suggest that Treg cells can be expanded both in vitro and in vivo when interacting with the appropriate APC type (26).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This might explain why a constant number of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells is maintained in the circulation.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	23	Common phenotypic markers of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are CD45RO, L-selectin (CD62L), CTLA-4 (CD152), CD25, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (27 to 30), although the same phenotypic profile can also be displayed by other T cell subsets.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Therefore, only functional assays can firmly identify CD4+CD25+ Treg cells.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nevertheless, recent studies in mice and humans have demonstrated that a novel transcription-repressor protein, FOXP3, is exclusively expressed by naturally occurring and induced CD4+CD25+ Treg cells (31 to 38).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	26	Current evidence suggests that human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells employ several mechanisms to suppress immune responses, for instance, via direct cell contact or indirectly by reducing the antigen-presenting capacity of APCs (39).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, at least in mice, suppressive cytokines appear to be involved in the effector function of Treg cells (40, 41).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	28	 It remains an open question whether one or more of these down-regulatory properties may be acquired by any naive CD4+ T cell in a normal peripheral immunostimulatory process.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	29	Cow's milk allergy in children is often a disease of relatively short duration, which makes it an interesting clinical model for the development of oral tolerance.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Using depletion of CD25+ cells as a read-out test for the suppressive effect that the Treg subset exerts on effector T cells, we were able to show that children who had outgrown their allergy (i.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	31	, are now tolerant against cow's milk allergens), developed a population of CD4+CD25+ T cells with regulatory function in their peripheral blood 1 wk after an in vivo milk challenge.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This subset was numerically and functionally reduced in children who remained allergic to cow's milk.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These results suggested mucosal induction of Treg cells in response to cow's milk proteins or, alternatively, that centrally generated Treg cells had become activated and expanded in children with outgrown food allergy.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	34	The original allergy diagnosis had been made at a median age of 5 mo (range 2 to 18 mo) based on the following criteria: persistent gastroenterological symptoms without, or in combination with, extraintestinal symptoms (see next paragraph) reported by the parents, followed by total disappearance of these symptoms on cow's milk-free diet for a period of at least 1 mo, and then followed by reappearance of similar symptoms by at least two open milk challenges observed by the parents (see next paragraph).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Children with a history of anaphylactic symptoms or evidence of cow's milk-specific IgE antibodies were excluded to make the test group as homogeneous as possible.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	36	The patients had demonstrated one or more of the following symptoms (number of cases in parenthesis): bloody and usually loose stools (n = 4), diarrhea (n = 8), failure to thrive (n = 5), eczema (n = 2), vomiting or regurgitation (n = 5), excessive crying (n = 5), and anemia (n = 1).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The symptoms had been observed by the parents from a median age of 3 mo (range 2 wk to 12 mo).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Where suspected, lactose intolerance was excluded by routine lactose challenge test (H2 breath test).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	39	Cow's Milk Challenge Procedure The reintroduction of cow's milk into the diet was done gradually, increasing the amount of milk or cow's milk-based formula to at least 100 ml/day during the first two days, continuing until the parents experienced unacceptable symptoms or until a routine evaluation was performed at the out-patient clinic after 1 wk.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	40	 All these clinical evaluations were performed by the same pediatrician, and 8 children (median age 24 mo, range 16 to 45 mo) were deemed to display persistently active cow's milk allergy, whereas 13 children (median age 24 mo, range 9 to 49 mo) had outgrown their allergy since they were now found to be tolerant to the milk challenge.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	41	 A blood sample was taken just before and 1 wk after the start of cow's milk reintroduction.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	42	Ethics The study was approved by the local Regional medical ethics committee (East Norway, Blindern, pb1139, Norway), and informed consent was obtained from the parents.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We selected our patients to be homogeneously nonatopic, but it would certainly be of interest in the future to also study children with elevated IgE antibody levels against food allergens in a similar experimental set-up.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, we had to design our in vitro experiments on the basis of the limited blood volumes available.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	182	 We also had to take into account that with the large age range of the patients (6 to 56 mo), they had a highly variable immunological history in terms of exposure to antigens from vaccines and the environment.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Importantly, we investigated tolerance induction via the gut, and recent animal experiments have demonstrated that the systemic and local immunization routes provide different results when it comes to dampening of mucosal allergy (46).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In view of this complex scenario, we decided that PHA stimulation, rather than an arbitrarily selected T cell to dependent antigen, would best ensure a consistent base-line response as a reference for the mucosal induction of Treg cells by cow's milk proteins.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	186	The in vitro proliferative activity of PBMCs against ss-LG was presumably a T cell recall response.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This result probably reflected that the patients with active allergy at this time point did not have a substantially larger number of circulating memory T cells specific for ss-LG than tolerant children.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The avoidance of cow's milk proteins for at least 2 mo before the challenge might have reduced this number, and specific T cells activated in GALT and mesenteric LNs would presumably start homing back to the intestinal lamina propria during milk challenge.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Thus, there was a reduced relative frequency of circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells in most allergic children after the challenge (Fig.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	191	It is of note that the ss-LG preparations contained LPS comparable to an endotoxin activity of 5000 EU/ml at 5 mg/ml (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test); but the polyclonal immunostimulation exerted by this contamination did not mask the antigen-specific T cell response elicited by ss-LG in vitro (unpublished data).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Interestingly, the proliferative response of PBMCs against ss-LG was significantly decreased in milk-tolerant compared with allergic children after the in vivo milk challenge.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our findings therefore suggested that in the tolerant children this challenge had resulted in GALT activation and expansion not only of specific effector T cells but also of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, which suppressed the in vitro proliferative response elicited by ss-LG.

0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	195	 1 B) was probably an underestimate due to homing of allergen-activated T cells to the milk protein to exposed gut lamina propria as alluded to above.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	196	Although it was originally believed that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are anergic, at least two independent reports recently showed that mouse CD4+CD25+ T cells initially multiply in vivo after appropriate antigen stimulation (26, 47).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We cannot exclude that the increased frequency of circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells after challenge in tolerant children partly reflected expansion of ordinary memory to effector T cells, but the striking increase (fivefold) of proliferative activity against ss-LG exhibited by PBMCs from these children after depletion of CD25+ cells strongly suggested that their CD4+CD25+ subset contained a substantial fraction of Treg cells.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This homeostatic mechanism most likely explained that they had outgrown their cow's milk allergy.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	199	 For ethical reasons we could not obtain blood at a later time point after the milk challenge, so we have no information with regard to the persistence of the elevated level of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the circulation of the tolerant children.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	200	Expression of integrin 4ss7 and CCR9 on T cells determines their homing into the small intestinal lamina propria (48).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We analyzed the frequency of T cells with these markers, but there were no apparent differences between the two groups of children.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It has been reported that the 4ss7 subset is increased in peripheral blood from children with cow's milk allergy, but that finding was obtained with T cells kept in culture for 1 wk (49).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Also, it might be unrealistic to expect that we should be able to identify a phenotypic change induced by milk proteins in the total circulating pool of T cells with gut-homing properties.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	204	Most functional studies of Treg cells have been performed in animal models for autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease, and transplantation.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The first human studies of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were in fact published quite recently (39, 50 to 52).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Evidence suggests that Treg cells may be antigen nonspecific, at least in the effector phase, and bystander suppression is a well-known phenomenon in oral tolerance (53, 54).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	207	 A nonspecific effect of Treg cells could explain why we obtained a moderate enhancement of proliferation against PHA in PBMCs from tolerant children after depletion of CD25+ cells (Fig.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Altogether, our results implied that mucosally induced Treg cells responding to milk antigens were involved in the observed tolerance induction or, alternatively, that centrally generated Treg cells had become activated and expanded in the children with outgrown cow's milk allergy.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	209	Expression of CTLA-4 has been associated with human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells (55).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This molecule is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm (27, 39), but once the cell is activated via the TcR complex it appears on the surface.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, the mechanistic role of surface CTLA-4 in cell contact to dependent suppression in humans is debated.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Several studies show that blocking CTLA-4 with antibodies does not abolish the suppressive activity of Treg cells (39, 51, 52).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	213	 We did not find any difference in the expression level of this surface marker, either between the two groups of children or the two time points for sampling of PBMCs.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Nevertheless, transwell experiments demonstrated that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells from milk-tolerant children exert their antiproliferative effect via a contact-dependent mechanism.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Regrettably, we had no possibility to study the involvement of other inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 (39, 56).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	216	The role in oral tolerance of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-ss derived from so-called regulatory Th3 cells induced in experimental animals is extensively documented (57).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The reduced production of TGF-ss by ss-LG to stimulated PBMCs after the in vivo milk challenge in the allergic group (Fig.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	218	 6 A) is in line with a recent study by Perez-Machado et al.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	219	 (58) which shows that T cells obtained from duodenal mucosa of food-allergic children had a decreased potential for TGF-ss production compared with healthy controls.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Conversely, we found that PBMCs stimulated by ss-LG 1 wk after the in vivo challenge tended to show increased production of TGF-ss in children with outgrown allergy, which could have contributed to the observed suppressive effect on proliferation.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The major source for IL-10 production in ss-LG to stimulated PBMC cultures in our experiments remains unknown, and the results obtained were inconclusive.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	222	It has been shown in mouse models that the thymic epithelium is important in the generation of naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Treg cells involved in the maintenance of tolerance (59).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Because our study strongly suggests that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells reactive to dietary antigens can be induced via the gut, it will be of considerable interest to investigate whether exosomes released from the intestinal epithelium play a role in the development of such cells.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	224	 We have previously obtained results indicative of a tolerance-inductive function of epithelial exosomes produced in the gut of experimental animals and therefore called these structures "tolerosomes" (60).
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	225	In conclusion, the observations presented here provide new insight into the possible relationship between mucosal induction of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and protection against food allergy in humans.
0.12080864.15197226.html.plaintext.txt	226	 These results may aid the development of better diagnostic tools for such disorders and perhaps contribute to promote a future goal of generating Treg cells in vitro for immunotherapy of allergic diseases.

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	3	Multiple prion strains have been described that are distinguished by their incubation periods and patterns of neuropathology when passaged in inbred lines of mice, and these distinctive phenotypes are preserved on multiple passage in the same host (for review, see Bruce et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The existence of prion strains challenges the protein-only hypothesis of prion propagation.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, it is clear that prion strains are associated with biochemical differences in PrPSc itself including differences in conformation (Hill et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	6	, 1997, 2003; Bessen  and  Marsh, 1992, 1994; Collinge et al.

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	8	, 1996) and overall protease resistance (Kuczius  and  Groschup, 1999).
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	9	 That these strain-associated biochemical differences in PrPSc fragment sizes and glycoform ratios following proteolysis can be transmitted to PrP in an experimental host argues that they may be responsible for encoding strain diversity.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	10	 While the precise nature of the molecular basis of prion strain diversity is unclear, that prion strains may be distinguished by the differing molecular mass of fragments following partial proteinase K digestion and by differing ratios of di-, mono- and unglycosylated PrPSc is clear.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Using this approach, we described four common PrPSc types in humans (Collinge et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	12	 PrPSc types 1 to 3 are seen in sporadic and iatrogenic CJD, while type 4 PrPSc is exclusively associated with variant CJD (vCJD) and is associated with a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot (Collinge et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This characteristic glycoform ratio is also seen in BSE-infected cattle brain and these observations, together with bioassay data from wild-type and transgenic mice and non-human primates, have proved critical in establishing a link between BSE and vCJD (Hill et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This characteristic molecular signature of BSE-derived prion isolates is seen in all UK cattle BSE cases examined and, together with biological strain typing studies in inbred and transgenic mice, suggests that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Hill et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 1996; Kuczius  and  Groschup, 1999; and our unpublished data).
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This molecular pattern, in additional to biological characteristics, is also maintained on transmission to other hosts such as domestic cat, sheep, macaque and other exotic animals, either by natural exposure or by experimental transmission (Bruce et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Recent data from French and Italian screening programmes suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We have also shown that on BSE transmission to a line of transgenic mice expressing only human PrP Met-129, Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35, two distinct molecular phenotypes can be produced: one that mirrors the vCJD phenotype with type 4 PrPSc and an additional molecular phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD with PrPSc type 2 (Asante et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These transgenic mice were generated on a mixed genetic background, and one possibility was that the different patterns were determined by background effects in individual mice (Asante et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This interpretation was supported by the demonstration that vCJD and BSE prions on primary passage to a series of inbred lines of mice were also able to produce two distinct molecular phenotypes on Western blotting, dependent only on the genetic background of the mice (Asante et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These data argued that two distinct strains had been propagated from cattle BSE.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, since the parameters that distinguish prion strains (incubation time, neuropathology and PrPSc type) are also known to be modulated by host genetic background, these cannot be adequately compared after primary passage in different lines of inbred mice (Bruce, 1993; Moore et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We therefore subpassaged these mouse-adapted BSE prions in the same inbred mouse line to determine whether distinctive biological characteristics resulted, indicative of different strains, and whether these correlated with the different PrPSc types propagated in the animals.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	24	For second passage to SJL mice, a single brain from a terminally sick mouse from the primary passage to SJL group (I783) was used to produce inoculum I1590 [cattle BSE (I783)SJL mice (I1590)SJL mice].

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The level and distribution of spongiosis (vacuolation) was similar for both groups (Fig.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Spongiosis was most prominent in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus with some involvement of the brain stem and basal ganglia, while the cerebellum was spared.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, consistent differences were observed with regard to neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus where the granule cell layer of the CA1 region of the dentate gyrus showed significant loss of cells with the C57BL/6-derived inoculum but remained intact with the SJL-derived BSE (Fig.

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	87	 For the C57BL/6-derived BSE (group 1), hippocampus, thalamus and brain stem were all heavily involved but less affected in SJL-derived BSE (group 2).
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In group 1, the cortex had a strongly pronounced  ribbon  of PrPSc, which followed the cortical lamination, but the rest of the cortex was mainly negative.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, in group 2, the cortex had a uniform distribution of diffuse staining for PrPSc (Fig.

0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	104	 However, it will be important to establish whether these strains are stable on further passage in SJL and other strains of mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Both C57BL/6 and SJL mice share the same PrP amino acid sequence and therefore the strain selection must be a feature of other genetic loci.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Within the limits of resolution available from Western blotting, the fragment sizes following proteinase K digestion were the same for the PrPSc associated with both strains, raising the possibility that the differences related to glycosylation and not to gross conformational differences, at least as differentiated by proteinase K digestion.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Additional studies will be required to characterize precisely the conformation and physico-chemical properties of PrPSc associated with these prion strains.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	108	Although recent reports suggest that alternative strains of BSE can be found in cattle, previous studies have suggested that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Bruce et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	109	 301V and 301C represent previously reported independent BSE strains; however, these were propagated in different strains of mice, which not only had very different genetic backgrounds (VM/Dk and C57) but also had two amino acid coding differences in PrP and therefore their  strain  characteristics cannot be directly compared.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	110	 It is possible that MRC2 represents the same strain as 301C; however, formal comparisons will be required to investigate this.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	111	The strain characteristics associated with MRC1 resemble those seen with passage of Chandler/RML scrapie in these strains of mice with respect to incubation time (122 plus or minus 1 days), histology and PrPSc type on Western blotting (unpublished data).
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We are confident that our findings are not the result of contamination with mouse scrapie as these transmissions were performed in accordance with rigorous biosafety protocols for preparation of inocula, inoculations and care of mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Disposable equipment was used for each inoculum and each mouse was identified with a unique transponder.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In addition, the MRC1 strain was also seen on primary passage to RIIIS mice and also on primary passage of vCJD to SJL mice (Asante et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	115	 vCJD is caused by a BSE-like prion strain (Hill et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	116	, 1996); therefore, it is not surprising that the same phenomenon is seen with both vCJD and BSE prions in the same strains of mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Further transmission studies are under way to characterize these vCJD-derived mouse strains.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	118	 A similar bifurcation of the BSE strain characteristics was also observed with independent BSE inocula in transgenic mice expressing human PrP with methionine at codon 129, Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35 (Asante et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	119	MRC2 and MRC1 were derived from different sources of BSE prions, I038 and I783, respectively.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	120	 I038 originated from a pool of five infected cow brainstems.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	121	 However, our extensive transmission studies with these isolates excluded the pooling of material from five cows as the source of the strain variation that we observe in these transmissions.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	122	 I038 gave the  classical  BSE signature and the novel phenotype was derived from I783, which originated from a single cow brain.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	123	 I783 has been used for transmissions in several inbred lines of mice in our laboratory and consistently produces the MRC2 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in C57BL/6JOlaHsd, FVB/NHsd, NZW/OlaHsd, SM/J and SWR/OlaHsd mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, it also consistently produces the MRC1 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in SJL/OlaHsd and RIIIS/J mice (Fig.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	125	 DNA sequence analysis of the bovine Prnp gene in I783 confirmed that the animal was homozygous for PrP amino acids, thereby excluding PrP heterozygosity as the source of the strain bifurcation.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	126	 I038 and other independent BSE inocula have also been shown to produce two  strains' in Tg(HuPrP129M+/+Prnp0/0)-35 transgenic mice, which are on a mixed genetic background.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We therefore believe that the prion strain selection or  mutation  is a feature of the genetic background of the mice and studies are under way to identify the genes involved.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Although recent data suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	129	, 2004), in this study, both I038 and I783 appeared to be the same single strain.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, Western blotting was unable to determine whether a mixed population of strains already existed in either of these brains or whether the alternative strains were generated de novo in the mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The inbred lines studied to date represent only a small proportion of the allelic variation that exists in the mouse genome; therefore, the study of other strains of mice, particularly those derived from unrelated strains such as trapped wild mice, may reveal additional BSE-derived strains.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	132	The human population exposed to BSE has a much more diverse genetic background than can be observed using laboratory strains of inbred mice.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Therefore, it is possible that BSE infection may be revealed not only as the type 4 PrPSc and associated vCJD clinicopathological phenotype seen to date (Collinge et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	134	, 2003), but in future, may also present with alternative PrPSc types, incubation times and neuropathology that may not be distinguishable from sporadic CJD (Hill et al.
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	135	, 2002) or represent additional novel phenotypes (Collinge, 1999).
0.12289999.15269389.html.plaintext.txt	136	 BSE may also have infected sheep flocks in the UK and, given the genetic diversity of sheep breeds, it is also possible that in some breeds BSE propagates as a strain type that is indistinguishable from natural sheep scrapie.

0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	3	 This may seem a minor achievement when compared with the 340 years of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, but I know it is a cause of some satisfaction, if not some surprise, to those present at its birth.

0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Credit is due to Franco Cavalli and those who worked with him to make that barroom banter into a reality and in the space of 10 years made Annals what it is one of the world's leading clinical oncology journals.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	6	It may be worthwhile to remind ourselves how recent 1990 is and how far Annals has come in those 15 years.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	7	 1990 began with George Bush Sr in the White House, Margaret Thatcher in 10 Downing Street and Nelson Mandela in prison.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In Berlin, the Wall began to be taken down and thousands stormed the Stasi's HQ.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In Britain, thousands rioted against the poll tax, and a government minister fed his daughter a beefburger on television to counter rumours of mad cow disease.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In August Iraq invaded Kuwait, precipitating the Gulf War.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In November a computer scientist working at the CERN laboratory in Geneva published a paper describing something he called the World Wide Web.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	12	The contribution of Annals of Oncology to these world events was exactly nil.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	13	 To suggest otherwise would be hubristic nonsense.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	14	 But within clinical oncology Annals has made, and is making, a difference.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Let me give you some numbers: in 1990 Annals of Oncology received 252 manuscripts; last year that figure was nearly 1000.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In 1990 Annals published barely 450 pages; last year that figure was over 1800.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In the last 5 years alone the impact factor of the journal has gone up some 26%, with last year's increase, to 3.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	18	605, the biggest single-year increase on record.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Subscriptions to the journal have grown dramatically, paralleling the growth of ESMO, and with the advent of the online journal (http://annonc.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	20	org) institutional access to the journal has increased from a few hundred paper subscribers to several thousand online.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Last year the Annals web site served over 700 000 full text articles to readers all over the world, including those in not-for-profit institutions in over 120 developing or middle-income countries, who are now able to apply for free or receive greatly discounted online access to the journal through initiatives operated by Oxford University Press (OUP), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	22	This year Annals, with the full support of both ESMO and OUP, will move to a copyright licence system that will allow authors to retain copyright of their published articles.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All concerned agree that this is fair and right, and it will, I believe make a further contribution to expanding access to Annals.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In parallel with this development we will be making changes to the journal's website.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Operation of the website will remain in the inestimable hands of Stanford University's HighWire Press, but we again hope to tweak things to improve the experience and expand access.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Significant among these tweaks will be the move to advance access publication, or publication ahead of print (charmingly shorthanded to PAP by the cognoscenti).
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This will involve an accepted article being published on the journal's website as soon as a finalised, corrected proof becomes available, irrespective of the paper issue to which it has been assigned.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In this way we hope to be able to bring important articles to Annals readers some 4 to 8 weeks ahead of print publication (see http://annonc.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	29	I hope it is clear from all this that I place the support of authors, editors and referees at the heart of the Journal.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Last year we again awarded the Annals of Oncology prizes [1] and, as predicted [2], it proved to be a worthwhile experience, thanks to the support of authors who chose Annals as the place they wanted to publish their research.
0.1233631.15598926.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The breadth and diversity of the science submitted to Annals never ceases to astonish me, from significant phase III randomised trials [3, 4] to early clinical [5] and preclinical [6] studies, from analyses of websites for complementary medicine [7] to important epidemiologic analyses [8].

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, September 22, 2003.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	3	Some clues to further understand PrP-related pathologies might come from a better knowledge of PrPc physiology and putative dysfunctions responsible for the disease.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In this respect, an interesting discussion revolving around cell death is ongoing, opening a new field of investigation.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It is clear that apoptosis accompanies the late stages of the disease.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Following that idea, several groups have set out to investigate the putative role of PrPc in the control of cell death.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	7	 From a theoretical point of view, PrP could be antiapoptotic, and the disease could result in the abolition of this function.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Alternatively, PrPc-related pathologies could be due to the exacerbation of a proapoptotic physiological phenotype associated with PrPc.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Studies carried out on distinct cell types, with various methodologies and approaches, have led to somewhat opposite conclusions (8-12).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of PrPc in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and TSM1 neurons as well as in an inducible cell line (Rov9) leads to increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli, reflected mainly by enhanced caspase-3 activity (13, 14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We further demonstrated that in TSM1 neurons, PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is associated with an up-regulation of p53 expression and transcriptional activity (14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This appears to be due to Mdm2-related post-transcriptional modification of p53 (14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	13	In the present study, we first establish that in HEK293, PrPc-related increased cell death is fully dependent on p53 activity.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Moreover, we demonstrate that p53 deletion in fibroblasts fully abolishes both PrPc-induced caspase-3 and p53 transcriptional activities.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We also show that in addition to our previously described post-transcriptional control of p53 (14), PrPc also enhances the transactivation of the p53 promoter.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	16	Because our TSM1 neurons stably overexpressed PrPc, it was also important to confirm the p53-dependent function of endogenous PrPc.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We therefore examined the physiological contribution of cellular PrPc to the control of neuronal cell death by comparing primary cultured neurons derived from mice harboring (Prnp+/+) or devoid (Prnp-/-, Zrch-1 mice (15)) of endogenous PrPc.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We show that neurons derived from Zrch-1 mice embryos are less sensitive to staurosporine and display lower DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 and p53 activities and expression, and higher Mdm2-like immunoreactivity.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We demonstrate that endogenous PrPc controls neuronal cell death via Mdm2-regulated p53-dependent caspase-3 activation in non-immortalized neurons.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Cells were left overnight at 4  degrees C, and then the propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured as described previously (14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For DNA nick-end labeling, cells were fixed for 20 min in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, left overnight in 70% ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick-end labeling TUNEL technique according to manufacturer's recommendations (kit from Roche Applied Science).

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and -galactosidase activities were measured according to previously described procedures (23).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Mouse p53 promoter was cloned as described (24) except that the same p53 promoter region was cloned upstream of luciferase instead of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The same construct lacking the p53 sequence was used as control.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	43	  We previously documented the fact that PrPc increases p38-like immunoreactivity and controls Mdm2-dependent p53 metabolic stability in TSM1 cells (14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Here we show that besides this post-transcriptional effect, PrPc also exerts transcriptional control of p53.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Thus, 3F4-HEK293 cells display a significantly higher p53 promoter transactivation than mock-transfected cells as indicated by the luciferase reporter activity (Fig.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	51	  We have previously established a link between p53 and the PrPc-induced phenotype using fibroblasts in which the p53 gene harbors a loss-of-function mutation.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To confirm this finding and preclude the possibility of a refolding/restoration of p53 activity after the chaperoning of mutated p53 (25), we have now switched to a fibroblastic cell line in which p53 has been invalidated and examined the phenotype triggered by overexpression of PrPc.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In the absence of p53, there is an important staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Interestingly, this p53-independent caspase activity was not enhanced by PrPc (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	55	 3B), whereas the combination of PrPc expression and p53 complementation led to an additional increase of caspase-3 activity (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Finally, the co-transfection of PrPc with p53 cDNA drastically potentiated the p53 transcriptional activity exhibited by p53 cDNA transfection alone (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Altogether, these data, combined with those observed after pifithrin- inhibition, clearly indicate that the PrPc proapoptotic phenotype is completely dependent on p53 and that the latter is controlled by PrPc at both the transcriptional (Fig.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It was therefore important to assess the contribution of endogenous PrPc.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	66	 We thus measured the staurosporine susceptibility of primary cultured neurons from Zrch-1 mice embryos in which the Prnp gene had been disrupted (15).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	67	 As expected, these neurons do not display any PrPc-like immunoreactivity (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	68	 That PrP-/- neurons exhibit lower staurosporine-induced responses is evidenced by both TUNEL (Fig.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Clearly, the staurosporine-induced increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei observed in PrP+/+ neurons is drastically lowered in neurons devoid of PrPc (Fig.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This was accompanied by a partial but reproducible recovery of the staurosporine-induced caspase activation responsiveness displayed by PrP+/+ neurons (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Thus, although mock-transfected PrP-/- display only 54% of the responsiveness of PrP+/+ neurons to staurosporine, three distinct 3F4MoPrP transfections of PrP-/- neurons consistently restored the staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation to about 81% of the control.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This incomplete rescue is in apparent agreement with the relatively low efficiency of 3F4MoPrP cDNA transfection illustrated by the expression of exogenous PrPc in PrP-/- primary cultured neurons and agrees well with all of the data described above.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Of greatest interest was the observation that p53 expression in the 1-month-old mouse brain was drastically lower in PrP-/- than in wild-type mice (Fig.

0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	120	  PrPc Controls Post-transcriptional Modulators of p53 Activity We searched for post-transcriptional modulators of p53 activity that would be under the control of endogenous PrP in primary cultured neurons.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Mdm2 was recently shown to decrease p53 metabolic stability thereby lowering its activity (20).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	122	 We demonstrate here that Mdm2 immunoreactivity is higher in PrP-/- than in wild-type neurons (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	123	 8D), a phenotype completely opposite from that observed for p53 immunoreactivity (see Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	124	 As p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was reported to up-regulate p53 activity via upstream of Mdm2 expression (26), we also examined the endogenous levels of the active, phosphorylated counterpart of p38 MAPK.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Active p38 immunoreactivity was higher in wild-type than in PrP-/- neurons (Fig.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	126	 8E), suggesting that PrPc also controls p38 phosphorylation at endogenous levels.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	127	Few things really are known concerning the physiological function of PrPc, but several lines of evidence indicate that PrPc could modulate cell death.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	128	 PrP mutations could trigger caspase activation (31), and murine scrapie appears to be associated with cell death (32).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Furthermore, prion infection impairs the cellular response to oxidative stress inducers (33) and triggers apoptosis in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line (34).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Altogether, these data suggest the ability of PrPc to modulate cell death, but whether this is due to an exacerbation of a proapoptotic function or, alternatively, to the alteration of an antiapoptotic phenotype could both be envisioned.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The literature in this field does not really solve the debate, and there are opposing data supporting both possibilities.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	132	 (8) have shown that serum deprivation-induced cell death is exacerbated in hippocampal neurons prepared from Prnp-/- mice.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	133	 On the other hand, PrPc also appears to protect human neurons from cell death triggered by overexpression of the proapoptotic oncogene Bax (9).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Finally, a recent paper indicates that PrPc could be a cellular mediator protecting retinal tissue from anisomycin-induced apoptosis (10).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	135	 From the above data one should expect a drastic deleterious effect of PrPc deletion due to the abrogation of this antiapoptotic phenotype.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This seems not to be the case, as PrPc-deficient mice are safe, healthy, and apparently develop and behave normally (15).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Furthermore, a recent article indicates that post-natal deletion of the PrPc alters the excitability of CA1 hippocampal neurons but does not induce neurodegeneration in adulthood (12).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	138	We had previously established that overexpression of PrPc enhances staurosporine-induced cell toxicity and DNA fragmentation and activates caspase-3 in stably transfected HEK293, TSM1 neurons, or inducible Rov9 cell lines (13, 14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Furthermore, we showed that PrPc-induced caspase-3 activation is mediated by an Mdm2-regulated p53-dependent pathway in TSM1 neurons (14).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	140	 These data are fully in agreement with a previous work demonstrating that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type PrPc could exhibit severe neurodegeneration (11).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	141	 However, it could be argued that the PrPc-related phenotype could be, in both cases, due to overexpression of the protein.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In line with such an hypothesis, a recent study nicely established that in N2A murine neuroblastoma cells, neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration could be associated with cytosolic accumulation of PrPc (35).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These data fully agreed with our demonstration that the manipulation of cytosolic PrPc concentration could indeed affect cell death.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Thus, proteasomal inhibition leads to increased PrPc-like immunoreactivity accompanied by drastic potentiation of caspase activation in HEK293 cells (13).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Conversely, depletion of cellular PrPc by immunosequestration at the membrane precludes the PrPc-induced proapoptotic phenotype (13).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	146	The present study first confirms that overexpression of PrPc enhances staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activity and demonstrates for the first time that in HEK293 cells, all PrPc-related phenotypes are p53-dependent.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	147	 These data have been fully reinforced by our observation that PrPc is inactive in p53-deficient fibroblasts.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Interestingly, we have established that, besides post-transcriptional modulation of p53, PrPc also enhances p53 promoter transactivation.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	149	It was most important to establish that the p53-dependent PrPc-related phenotype was not solely due to an artifactual perturbation of the cell physiology caused by the overexpression of the protein.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In this context, we examined the contribution of endogenous PrPc to apoptotic response by monitoring cell death in primary cultured neurons derived from mice embryos in which the Prnp gene had been abrogated (Zrch-1).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Our data show that deletion of PrPc led to a phenotype fully opposite of PrP overexpression.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Prnp-/- neurons are indeed less sensitive to staurosporine as monitored by TUNEL-positive cells, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activity and immunoreactivity.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Furthermore, this phenotype appears linked to a drastic reduction of p53 activity and immunoreactivity.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Finally, the p53 activator (p38 MAPK) and inhibitor (Mdm2) immunoreactivities are reduced.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This indicates that PrPc likely controls p53, at least in part, at a post-transcriptional level, as we demonstrated in TSM1 neurons by an overexpression approach (13).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Therefore, our current study further demonstrates that PrPc controls caspase activity through a p53-dependent and Mdm2-regulated process and that this proapoptotic phenotype is not caused artifactually by overexpression of the protein.
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	157	We recently established that in Alzheimer's disease, presenilin-2, a protein that when mutated mainly contributes to Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies, also controls cell death response to staurosporine by an identical p53-dependent mechanism (36).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This observation, together with our demonstration that similar proteolytic dysfunctions occur in both Alzheimer's and prion diseases, suggests that several common features could link apparently distinct neurodegenerative diseases (37).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This is also true when one considers Parkinson's disease pathology in which an -synuclein anti-apoptotic physiological phenotype (22) is associated to p53 down-regulation, which is abolished by 60H-dopamine, a toxin associated with this pathology (38).
0.12702371.14570892.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Altogether, these observations suggest envisioning p53 as a molecular target for therapeutic strategies in various neurodegenerative pathologies.

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Besides serving the bugs, this evil intelligence is exploitable for studying cellular physiology, and the bewildering affinity of bacterial toxins for crucial host cell proteins has taught us many a thing on how cells work.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	9	Perhaps Brucella may help teach us the function of the normal prion protein (1).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Brucella species are Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	11	 They invade, resist intracellular killing, and replicate in phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells (2).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	12	 But how does Brucella initiate replication in macrophages? The contact with the bug instructs the macrophage to internalize it; the mode of internalization (Fc and complement receptors vs.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	13	 uptake of nonopsonized bugs) determines the fate of the bug (2).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	14	Brucella actively modulates its own engulfment.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It induces peculiar membrane ruffles at its site of contact with the macrophage and slow "swimming internalization" into a macropinosome.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Then, Brucella takes full control of the macropinosome.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It inhibits its maturation into a degradative lysosome (3) and reprograms it to acquire endoplasmic reticulum markers and mature into a "replicative phagosome" where bacteria start multiplying (Fig.

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	20	 abortus transports Hsp60 via the VirB type IV system onto its surface.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Upon encounter with a macrophage, Hsp60 binds to PrPC, which is embedded in lipid rafts on the macrophage surface.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This is thought to modulate phagocytosis (swimming internalization), mediate macropinosome formation, inhibit lysosome fusion, and steer the macropinosome to the formation of the replicative phagosome.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Other, hitherto unknown effector proteins traveling via the VirB system are also involved (see text; based on the findings by Watarai et al.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	24	  For playing these tricks, Brucella relies on a set of virulence factors, including a bacterial injection organelle termed VirB or type IV secretion system (4 to 8).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	25	 When exposed to macrophages in vitro, virB-deficient bugs cannot modulate phagocytosis and are degraded in the lysosome.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	26	 But what does the VirB system exactly do in this context? According to Watarai et al.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (1), it may be needed for transporting the bacterial heat shock protein Hsp60 onto the surface of the bug.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Unexpectedly, the chaperonin Hsp60, which normally hangs out in the cytoplasm and deals with unfolded proteins (9), turns out to reside on the surface of wild-type Brucella abortus but not virB mutants.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	29	On the macrophage surface, Brucella attaches to cholesterol-rich microdomains called lipid "rafts" (10 to 12).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	30	 There, Hsp60 appears to snatch at an unlikely friend, the cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is encoded by the Prnp gene and resides preferentially in rafts.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	31	 PrPC is apparently recruited to the macrophage's membrane protrusions, which engulf the bacteria, and subsequently to the early macropinosome.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	32	 abortus does not modulate phagocytosis nor phagosome maturation.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This is strikingly similar to the behavior of Brucella virB mutants and suggests that the Hsp60 to PrPC interaction is instrumental for these actions.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	34	The latter presumption is backed up by animal studies.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Wild-type Brucella replicates in wild-type mice, whereas virB mutants do not (13).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In Watarai's (1) experiments, both wild-type and VirB-deficient bugs are avirulent in PrPC-deficient mice.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Hence, the Hsp60 to PrPC connection is important in real infections (Fig.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	38	So, what can Brucella teach us about PrPC? The prion is the infectious agent causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (14).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Its only known constituent is PrPSc, a conformational isoform of PrPC, which is expressed at various levels in most mammalian cells.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The only established function of PrPC in vivo is to enable transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Ablation of Prnp abrogates prion replication (15) and pathogenesis (16).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, the physiological function of PrPC has remained mysterious.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Prnpo/o mice show no obvious developmental defect and live long, happy lives (17).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Subtle changes in circadian rhythms (18) and alterations of hippocampal function (19 to 22) have been described in Prnpo/o mice.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, some of these phenotypes were not reproduced by others (23) and none were clarified in molecular terms.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	46	Biochemically, PrPC was reported to do almost everything, including the opposite of everything.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	47	 For example, PrPC binds copper (24) and was suggested to be a cuproenzyme, but others hold this finding for a red herring (25).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	48	 PrPC may have antiapoptotic properties (26 to 29), but others find that it sensitizes neurons to apoptosis (30).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	49	 PrPC peptides might be neurotoxic (31), or maybe not (32).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Prion toxicity might be due to retrotranslocation of PrPC from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm (33), but maybe retrotranslocation does not occur after all (34).

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	52	And yet reverse genetics shows that PrPC must have some biological function and bind to one or more partners in a functionally meaningful way.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Transgenic expression of amino proximally truncated PrPC mutants causes cerebellar degeneration and early death (35).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This phenotype is only observed in Prnpo/o mice and is fully reverted by substoichiometric coexpression of full-length PrPC.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	55	 It follows that truncated PrP interferes with a physiological function of PrPC and that its effector domain lies in its amino proximal half.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	56	 A similar phenotype is elicited by overexpression of the Dpl protein (36), which resembles truncated PrPC and may therefore represent an endogenous PrPC antagonist (37).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	57	Population genetics provides further evidence that PrPC is doing more than bestowing prion diseases on us.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Protective variations in the human prion gene, which arose recently in evolution, have disseminated much more efficiently among human populations than nonprotective polymorphisms (38).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This provides a compelling case for a role in evolutionary fitness, similarly to globin gene mutations that are protective against malaria.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Selective pressure to maintain heterozygosity might have come from Kuru, a cannibalism-transmitted prion disease that was a prime cause of death in New Guinea tribes.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	61	 One disturbing conclusion is that cannibalism was commonplace among our ancestors (38).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Consequently prion diseases, now exceedingly rare, have probably ravaged human populations in the distant past.

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	68	So, what are the elusive functions and partners of PrPC? Several PrPC binding factors have been described, including the laminin receptor precursor protein (39), heparan sulfate (40), N-CAM (41), and bcl-2 (42), yet none of these interactions were linked to biological functions.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Could PrPC serve as a general Hsp60 sensor? Hsp60 homologues are found in bacteria and all eukaryotic cells, and can induce inflammation and immune responses (43, 44).
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	70	 It will be exciting to test whether PrPC is involved in an Hsp60-dependent common "danger sensing" mechanism for detection of destructed body cells and pathogenic microbes (43, 44).

0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	74	 How is Hsp60 recognized and transported by the VirB type IV system? And how is it retained on the bacterial surface? (b) What is the function of the Hsp60 to PrPC complex? Is it simply slowing down the initial steps of phagocytosis to allow sufficient time for injection via the VirB type IV system and the manipulation of the early macropinosome by other so far unidentified effector proteins? Or does it serve as an anchor for assembling a whole set of host cellular proteins on the macropinosome membrane? (c) The Hsp60 to PrPC interaction is clearly insufficient for proper macropinosome formation and maturation.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Hence, the function of the type IV secretion system must go beyond surface exposure of Hsp60.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Which effector proteins travel via this pathway and what is their function? (d) Bacteria often accomplish their deeds by disrupting specialized cellular functions.
0.12703612.12847133.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Does Brucella interfere with the function of PrPC? If so, what does it get out of it? Answers to these questions may come from analyzing interactions between Hsp60 and amino terminally truncated versions of PrPC.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Laboratory of Genetics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, June 24, 2005 , and in revised form, August 12, 2005.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	3	In contrast, Smad complexes bind to several Drosophila silencer elements without the assistance of a cofactor (11, 12).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	4	 These silencers repress the brinker (brk), bag of marbles (bam), and gooseberry (gsb) genes in response to signaling by decapentaplegic (dpp).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Repression of brk plays a central role in the dpp pathway (13, 14); in addition to direct activation by Smads, Dpp targets are regulated indirectly through repression by the Brk protein (15 to 18).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Repression of brk occurs through a silencer that binds a complex of the Smad proteins Mothers Against Dpp (Mad) and Medea (Med) (11).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Mad is homologous to the BMP2-specific Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 receptor-activated Smads (rSmads).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Med is the homolog of Smad4, the coSmad that forms complexes with rSmads.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Genetic and biochemical analyses confirmed that Mad and Medea are both required for repression of brk (11, 19, 20).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Repression of brk also requires the large zinc finger protein Schnurri (Shn) (11, 19, 20).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Although Shn contains three zinc finger clusters, alone it does not bind to the silencer, and repression requires only a carboxyl-terminal region containing three zinc fingers that confer interaction with the silencer-bound Mad-Med complex (11, 12).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In the gonad Dpp signaling and Shn are also required for repression of bam (21, 22), a differentiation factor that must be kept off in germ line stem cells (23).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A Dpp-responsive silencer is located in the bam 5'-untranslated region just 27 bp from the transcriptional start (24).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Both silencers consist of paired Mad and Med binding sites (12, 25), and binding of the Mad-Med complex in turn allows binding of Shn.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	15	The ability of Mad-Med complexes to recognize the brk and bam silencers without help from cofactors suggests that Smad complexes are capable of greater DNA binding affinity and specificity than had been observed previously.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	16	 One means of achieving this would be for a greater number of MH1 domains to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The number of MH1 domains contained within a Smad complex is determined by the way in which Smad MH2 domains oligomerize (26 to 29).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The tendency of MH2 domains to crystallize as trimers and heterotrimers (30 to 34) suggests that heterotrimers are the principal heteromeric Smad complex in vivo (34).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, work from several groups has provided evidence that Smads also form other types of complexes, including heterodimers (35 to 37).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	20	Here we report that Mad and Med bind to the brk and bam silencers through all three MH1 domains of a Mad-Med heterotrimer.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The results reveal a mechanism by which Smad complexes bind certain regulatory elements with high affinity and specificity.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The arrangement of these sites is critical for silencing, and minor alterations can result in Dpp-responsive transcriptional activation instead of repression.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	75	To investigate the stoichiometry of silencer-bound Mad-Med complexes, we fused one or two copies of eGFP to the amino-terminal ends of FLAG-tagged Mad and of FLAG-tagged Med.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	76	 eGFP was deemed suitable for this approach (43) because it is effectively monomeric (44, 45).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The resulting 1x and 2x GFP fusions to Mad and Med bound to BamSE and BrkS probes in gel shift assays with about the same affinity as their normal counterparts but with slower mobility that was easily distinguishable from the wild-type Mad-Med-silencer complex (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This allowed us to test whether each Smad existed in one or two copies within the DNA-bound complex.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	79	 For example, if only one Mad exists in the complex, coexpression of Mad and 2xGFPMad (together with Med and TkvQD) should give two bands, the normal Mad-Med complex and the slower mobility 2xGFPMad-Med complex.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	80	 If the complex contains two Mad subunits, there should be three bands, Mad-Mad-Med, Mad-2xGFPMad-Med, and 2xGFPMad-2xGFPMad-Med.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Using a BamSE probe, the combination of Mad, 2xGFPMad, and Med resulted in three bands (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	82	 2A), of which the intermediate band was the strongest in intensity, as expected because Mad-2xGFPMad-Med complexes should be twice as abundant as complexes containing only one Mad isoform.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Furthermore, the intermediate band had the same mobility observed for a 1xGFP-Mad + Med complex, consistent with a mobility shift caused by the presence of two copies of eGFP.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The same result was obtained using a BrkS probe (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	85	 2B), and thus we conclude the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains two Mad subunits.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In contrast, we found that lysates containing Mad, Med and 2xGFPMed formed only two bands (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	87	 2, A and B), indicating that the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains only a single Med subunit.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	88	Mad Contacts GRCGNC by Means of the -Hairpin The DNA-binding interface of Smad3 is a -hairpin structure (42) that is completely conserved in all rSmads, with only two amino acid differences in coSmads.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This conservation of the DNA-binding interface suggests that all Smads might bind DNA with the same sequence specificity.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	90	 However, the GC-rich binding sites first described for Mad and later for Smad1 appear to be distinct from the canonical Smad3 GTCT site, and it has been proposed that such sites are bound through sequence-nonspecific contact with the lysine-rich helix 2, which lies adjacent to the -hairpin (46, 47).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	91	Single base pair substitutions in the GRCGNC sites of BrkS and BamSE diminish binding of the Mad-Med complex and repression (12) (data not shown), evidence that binding of the Mad-Med complex to GRCGNC sites is sequence-specific.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To investigate the basis for this sequence specificity, we introduced alanine substitutions at three positions within the Mad -hairpin, Arg-88, Gln-90, and Lys-95, each of which corresponds to a Smad3 residue whose side chain makes direct base-specific contact in the Smad3-DNA structure (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Western blots showed that these mutations and all others described below had little or no effect on the level of Mad or Med in whole cell lysates (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Nonetheless, all three mutations strongly reduced complex formation with BrkS (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	95	 As expected, alanine substitutions at the corresponding positions in Med had a similar effect (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We also tested an alanine substitution for Mad His-93, which corresponds to His-79 in Smad3, a residue that makes indirect base contact through water molecules (47), and found that it caused a less drastic but reproducible reduction in binding affinity for BrkS (Fig.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	105	  Helix 2 Contributes to DNA Binding Although our results indicated that binding of Mad to the GRCGNC occurs via the -hairpin, we went on to test whether residues within or adjacent to helix 2 might nevertheless contribute to binding.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The lysine-rich stretch of helix 2 has been shown to function as a nuclear localization signal (48, 49) but a series of helix 2 lysine to alanine mutations resulted in little or no change in Mad or Med levels in whole cell lysates of transfected 293T cells, as determined from Western blots (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Comparing these lysates in gel shift experiments, we found that Mad-Med-BrkS complex formation was strongly disrupted by Mad R58A, a residue that is just carboxyl-terminal to helix 2, with moderate effects caused with Mad K46A and by Med R66A, K74A and D80A (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The results show that helix 2 and carboxyl-terminally adjacent residues contribute to the DNA binding activity of Med as well as that of Mad, suggesting that helix 2-backbone contact may be a general feature of Smad-DNA interaction and not exclusive to interaction with the GRCGNC site.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Together, these results suggest that Mad and Med both contact DNA via the -hairpin in a configuration that is similar to that of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to GTCT, possibly with helix 2 tilted somewhat closer to the DNA backbone.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Notably, alanine substitutions in helix 2 of Mad and Med had no obvious effect on recruitment of ShnCT (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Because binding of ShnCT requires precise 5-bp spacing between GRCGNC and GTCT (discussed below), the MH1 domains are likely sites for Shn interaction.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	112	 These results indicate that any MH1 contact with ShnCT does not depend critically on solvent-exposed helix 2 side chains.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	113	The stretch of basic amino acids that starts in helix 2 extends further in Mad than in Smad3, and we found that one of these additional residues, Arg-58, is required to form the silencer complex.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	114	 However, from comparison with the Smad3MH1-DNA crystal structure, it is doubtful that Arg-58 would be able to contact the DNA backbone from its position at the end of helix 2.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Indeed, the R58A substitution had little effect on binding of purified maltose-binding protein-MadNL (which binds as a monomer) to probes containing GTCT or GGCGAC, whereas R88A dramatically reduced binding to both probes (data not shown), evidence that Arg-58 is not directly involved in DNA contact.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Rather than directly contacting DNA, Arg-58 may engage in protein-protein interactions that stabilize the DNA-bound Mad-Med heterotrimer.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, when bound as a heterotrimer, the Mad MH1 domain adopts a structure in which Arg-58 contacts the DNA backbone.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	118	The -Hairpin Is Required in Both Mad Subunits The results described above prove only that the -hairpin is required in at least one of the two Mad subunits contained within the heterotrimer.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	119	 To test whether the -hairpin is required in both Mad subunits, we coexpressed Mad R88A, Q90A and K95A mutant proteins with wild-type 2xGFP-Mad and performed a gel shift with a BrkS probe.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	120	 If -hairpin contact was required in only one of the two Mad MH1 domains, we expected to observe an intermediate band containing 2xGFPMad and MadR88A (or Q90A/K95A).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Faint intermediate bands were observed (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	122	 4), but even the strongest of these, Q90A, was much weaker than for wild-type.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We interpret these results as a demonstration that an intact -hairpin is required in both Mad subunits, although presence in just one subunit does allow for some residual binding.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In contrast, changing GTCT to GGCG (mut2 in Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	152	 5A) had only a modest effect on Mad-Med binding but prevented recruitment of Shn (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	153	 5B), transforming the silencer into a Dpp-responsive activating element (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Similarly, a 1-bp increase (data not shown) or decrease (mut3 in Fig.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	159	 These results demonstrate that repression is dependent on a precise (GRCGNC)-(N)5-GTCT arrangement and that trimeric Smad complexes that cannot recruit Shn behave as transcriptional activators.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	160	Our findings contradict a previous report that Mad and Med bind to BrkS as a dimer (12).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Although no documentation was provided for how this was determined experimentally, our own attempts to determine stoichiometry by means of antibody supershift experiments suggest a possible explanation for the discrepancy.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We found that epitope tags at the Mad amino terminus are only readily accessible to the antibody on one of the two Mad subunits (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	163	 1D), possibly because of crowding by the adjacent DNA-bound MH1 domain of Med.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This problem led us to turn instead to the use of protein fusions as a strategy (43) for assessing stoichiometry.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	165	Mad and Med appear to be the only factors that directly contact the bam and brk silencers (11, 12).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This conclusion is based on mutational analysis of the BrkS element, which showed that mutations that disrupt silencing also disrupt binding of the Mad-Med complex.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The only exceptions were mutation of GTCT to GTCG (12) or to GGCG (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	168	 5) and a 1-bp deletion between the Mad and Med sites (12) (Fig.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	169	 5), each of which allowed binding of the Mad-Med complex but disrupted recruitment of Shn.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Overexpression of activated Mad-Med complexes is sufficient to generate these gel shift complexes, and therefore it is unlikely that an unknown cofactor is required because it would presumably need to be expressed at high levels endogenously in both Drosophila and human cells.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The demonstration that binding of the Mad-Med heterotrimer requires all three MH1 domains also weighs against cofactor involvement because it becomes difficult to explain how GRCGNC could be contacted by a cofactor in addition to two Mad MH1 domains (the Med MH1 contacting GTCT).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Nonetheless, it is possible that a cofactor present in Drosophila and human extracts has gone undetected, although the evidence suggests it could not play a direct role in sequence-specific DNA contact.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	173	The apparent ability of a Mad-Med complex to bind silencers without cofactors contrasts with the general reliance of Smads on DNA-binding cofactors for target specificity.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	174	 brk could be considered a special case because it is negatively regulated by Dpp globally (15 to 18), whereas other Dpp targets require tissue-specific regulation (41, 52 to 57).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, bam expression is specific to germ line cells, and thus it is unexpected that DNA contact by Mad and Med would be sufficient for the regulatory specificity of the bam silencer.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The existence of a similar Dpp-responsive silencer regulating gooseberry (12) provides further evidence that these novel arrangements of Smad binding sites provide sufficient specificity for regulation in response to signaling.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Nonetheless, tissue specificity might be augmented by cooperative interaction of DNA-bound corepressors with Smads bound to BrkS/BamSE-like sites.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	178	The high affinity of Mad and Med for these silencers is explained by the trimeric stoichiometry and involvement of all MH1 domains in directly contacting DNA.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The ability of a single Smad complex to engage all three MH1 domains in DNA contact has several implications.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The most obvious is that Smad complexes may in some cases make a greater contribution to target recognition than was previously apparent.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	181	 As in the case of brk, this provides a mechanism by which Dpp, BMP, or even transforming growth factor- signaling might trigger a general response without the need for a tissue-specific cofactor.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Such a response need not be limited to silencing because slight alterations in the silencers transform them into Dpp-responsive activating elements, possibly by allowing CBP to interact with the Mad-Med complex (58) in the absence of Shn.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Conserved sites exhibiting the BrkS/BamSE motif have been identified within BMP-response elements for the Id genes (59 to 61), which as a class are responsive to BMP signaling (62, 63).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Conversely, tissue specificity might be conferred upon such tripartite Smad response elements by adjacent binding sites for other transcription factors.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	185	A second implication is that Smad complexes may have greater flexibility in their ability to recognize binding sites than was previously apparent, particularly for moderate affinity sites to which only two MH1 domains make sequence-specific contact.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The observed flexibility in spacing between the Mad and Med sites in BrkS and BamSE suggests that DNA binding by Med plus just one Mad MH1 domain might be able to occur in a variety of permutations.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, loss of binding when the Med site was reversed (mut1 in Fig.

0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	189	 A moderate affinity site might also consist of just the GRCGNC Mad binding site without an adjacent Med binding site, as appears to be the case for many Dpp-responsive enhancer elements (41, 52 to 54, 57, 64, 65).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	190	3 Such moderate affinity sites would activate transcription in response to Dpp signaling, but only when the necessary tissue-specific cofactor is present.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Some Mad sites serve also as binding sites for the Brk protein, which opposes Dpp signaling by direct competition for Mad binding and by functioning as an active repressor (40, 66 to 69).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	192	The third implication is for complexity in the response to BMP signaling.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In vertebrates that possess three BMP-responsive rSmads, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, BMP signaling might trigger the formation of a variety of trimeric rSmad complexes with Smad4 (e.
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	194	 There is the potential for six such combinations (114, 554, 884, 154, 184, and 584).
0.13232653.16109720.html.plaintext.txt	195	 If such mixed complexes do form, as has been shown for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in activation of p15Ink4B (70), it will be important to determine whether differences exist among them in the range of binding sites that can be bound by means of two or three MH1 domains.

0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	0	Commentary: Shaw s critique of health care is still valid K Srinath Reddy.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	1	All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110 029, India.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	2	The preface provided by George Bernard Shaw to The Doctor s Dilemma1 is a profoundly insightful and deliberately provocative essay on the short-comings of health care, as provided by doctors who are deficient in scientific thought and are driven by petty profit motives.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	3	 It is also an eloquent espousal of an ideal public health system, devoid of those flaws.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Though Shaw was unduly harsh on Pasteur, improperly critical of the efforts to eliminate smallpox and his prototype of an underpaid doctor driven to malpractice no longer exists in many parts of the world, most of the ideas developed in the preface are of great contemporary relevance.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	5	Shaw s consistent demand for credible evidence is the hallmark of a truly scientific mind.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	6	 He expresses despair, and even disgust, at the usual medical practitioner not applying the methods of scientific enquiry and the principles of statistical analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment methods which they espouse with ill-informed enthusiasm and willingly inflict on an unsuspecting public.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The situation has not improved greatly since Shaw s time.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Even as  evidence  constantly accumulates in the pages of prolific research publications, the average practitioner is often distanced from its message.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Even when a part of that message does reach him or her, often through the pharmaceutical industry s sales promoters or through the lay media, the aptitude and the ability to subject that message to serious scientific scrutiny are severely deficient.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	10	Shaw protests against the incorrect use of statistics and the lack of matched comparison groups.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	11	 He argues convincingly that apparent benefits of interventions are easily demonstrable in the absence of a matched comparison group and cautions that such spurious interpretations ought not to guide medical practice.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	12	 He makes out a good case for employing the scientific design of a controlled trial for evaluating medical interventions.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	13	 He is particularly caustic about the ecological fallacies that arise from analyses that depend on time trends and do not take into account the confounding effects of concomitant changes in other determinants.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The example he provides, of the relationship between disappearance of typhus and amputation of the little finger, is particularly telling.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The clarity with which he identifies and describes confounding as a factor which bedevils  causal  associations would do an epidemiologist proud.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	16	He especially emphasizes the role of socioeconomic status as an important determinant of differences in the levels of health and as a powerful confounder which influences the effect of interventions which aim to alter health.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	17	 His socialist ideology and scientific temper blend into a brilliantly incisive analytical tool as he dissects out the contributions of poverty and deprivation to ill health and pours out his convictions in a passionate piece of advocacy urging greater attention to such broader determinants of health.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The adverse health implications of a low socioeconomic status have now been widely documented in virtually all areas of health, from under-nutrition and infectious diseases to many of the non-communicable diseases.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	19	 While a Virchow, a McKeown, or a Marmot may call attention to this from among the public health fraternity, it requires the writing power of a Dickens or a Shaw to stir the conscience of the world to take heed and initiate action.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	20	The issues related to  confidence intervals  and  absolute risk  also come up in Shaw s preface, although the specific terms are not used.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	21	 He questions the validity of drawing conclusions from estimates based on a zero numerator and a denominator which is very small (he uses a sample size of one in the smallpox vaccination example).
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The need to estimate confidence intervals and use them for judging the possible range of the effect size associated with an intervention has been emphasized often enough in statistics.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Yet a substantial section of published research, and clinical practice even more so, have not yet benefited from the statistical lesson that Shaw provides us.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Too often the  zero numerator  exercises a seductive appeal that clouds judgement, as the upper confidence limit is blissfully ignored by those who interpret the numbers.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	25	2 Similarly, published studies too often focus on relative risk to put a  spin  on the results of trials, without informing the practising doctor as to the difference that is likely to occur in the absolute risk of an event.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Thus a measure of risk which is relevant to the study of aetiological associations is substituted, in a pseudoscientific sleight of hand, for a measure of risk which is relevant to decision making on individual management in clinical practice.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The  cruder tricks  which disturbed Shaw continue to dismay us when results of scientific investigations are inaccurately interpreted, either out of ignorance or with deliberate intent to mislead.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	28	Shaw is particularly lucid when he talks of the benefits of  attention  to health, which need to be accounted for, before ascribing the virtue of independent benefit to an intervention.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The beneficial effects of placebos and of the attention bestowed on the participants in a clinical trial have been well described in many recent publications on clinical research methodology.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	30	 That Shaw demanded rigorous proof of a truly independent contribution made by an intervention is remarkable, when we consider that even now policy and practice are all too frequently swayed by the results of uncontrolled or inadequately controlled studies (such as some demonstration projects) wherein the effects of co-intervention and confounding are poorly assessed.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	31	Shaw discusses the influence of demand and supply on the nature of medical practice from two seemingly contradictory but essentially complementary viewpoints.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	32	 On the one hand, he laments (and rightly so) that giving the doctor a pecuniary interest in prescribing costly tests, medication, or surgery motivates him to manipulate the  demand  to suit his interests.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	33	 That such a  supplier driven demand  makes medical care a prime example of market failure is all too evident in the present era of technology-intensive high cost investigations and interventions.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At the same time, he also argues that the laity can reset the nature of the supply, by demanding certain types of care or expressing a preference for hygienic modes of disease prevention.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This too is true, as the growing market for  complementary  or  alternative  systems of medicine demonstrates.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is not surprising that practitioners of  modern  medicine are also now warming up to some of these treatment methods, after many years of scepticism.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The fact that there is now a great scientific and public health interest in the health promoting effects of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as in the merits of a Mediterranean diet supports the contention that doctors recognize the need to respect conventional wisdom and respond to it with research which can confirm or repudiate.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	38	However, the dominance of the profit motive in those who provide or control health care would still lead them to manipulate the demand to the maximal extent they can.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	39	 They would employ reductionist research to seek out the protective phytochemicals, antioxidants or fibre from fruits and vegetables, so that they can be marketed as pills and potions.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The imbalance between a supplier-driven demand and a consumer-generated demand would always be resolved in favour of the provider, till consumers (acting as communities and as individuals) become better informed and more assertive in resetting the demand for the health care they deserve and desire.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	41	Shaw finally suggests a model, wherein pubic health which is protected and promoted by a Public Health Service comprising Medical Officers of Health who are committed to act as benefactors of the community, to replace the petty private tradesmen profiteering from illness.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This is a model that has only been partly developed and insufficiently applied, even in countries with socialized systems of health care, and hence cannot be considered as one adequately tried and tested.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	43	 It is tragic, therefore, that the model is being discarded as a failure and that national health services are being dismantled in a hurry to provide a free rein to privatized and commercialized medical care.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Shaw s vision is even more relevant today than at the time of his writing.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This is because the commodification of health care has proceeded to far more sinister levels of organization than in the days of the  precarious, shabby-genteel, irresponsible  private practitioner whom he perceived as the principal danger.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The Jekyll to Hyde pathway of transformation has proceeded through stages, from the benign family physician to the greedy private doctor to the medical cartels in larger hospitals to the present state where large corporations control the production and distribution of drugs, devices and other technologies for which the individual doctor is only a robotic sales agent.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	47	 As the juggernaut of commercial medicine rolls on, the individual doctor s role too becomes inconsequential and the citizen s health is further forfeit to corporate profits.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	48	It is tempting to speculate on how Shaw would have reacted to the social forces which are shaping global health today as well as to the new threats to public health that have emerged since his time.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The epidemics of non-communicable diseases now sweeping across the world are being driven by some of the undesirable elements of industrialization, urbanization and globalization.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	50	 From tobacco to processed food and from drugs to vaccines, the language of trade threatens to dominate the discourse on public health.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The agents of ill health are marketed aggressively by transnational mega-corporations as they battle to win over the minds and the money of consumers spread over many countries.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Even communicable diseases come in new forms as globalized trade not only speeds up human travel but also promotes livestock farming at an industrial level.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	53	 One wonders what caustic comments would have come from Shaw s critical pen about the factors that led to  mad cow disease  or even sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which may be a byproduct of an expanding animal to human interface in a setting of unhygienic livestock breeding for commercial purposes.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	54	The solutions needed today, therefore, go beyond the creation of a responsive and responsible Medical Officer of Health.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We require a broader and stronger edifice of global public health in which the multiple determinants of health are addressed and influenced from a perspective where peoples  health takes precedence over corporate wealth.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The mould which makes the individual doctor too needs to be recast.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Epidemiology, economics, and ethics which are sadly deficient in modern medical training need to be strengthened, so that the doctor who emerges from the portals of the medical college is endowed with a scientific temper, a spirit of social responsibility, and the ability to utilize available resources more efficiently for promoting better health outcomes.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The role of non-physician health care providers has increased since Shaw s time and needs to be further strengthened.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Well informed involvement of communities in health promotion and of patients in self care are receiving greater emphasis in the participatory models of health care that seek to replace the prescriptive models.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	60	 All of these components must contribute to a more scientific, efficient, and equitable pattern of health care.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Towards the end of this preface, Shaw expresses optimism that public health will get the champions it needs to provide a social solution to the medical problem.
0.13508143.14681245.html.plaintext.txt	62	 I too will end this commentary with the hope that global consciousness will rise to ensure the triumph of public health over the many threats it faces.

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	2	Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders which affect a range of mammalian species.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	3	 In humans they can be inherited and sporadic as well as acquired by exposure to human prions.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Prions appear to be composed principally of a conformational isomer of host-encoded prion protein and propagate by recruitment of cellular prion protein.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Recent evidence argues that prion protein can also encode disease phenotypes by differences in its conformation and glycosylation.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Such molecular analysis of prion strains suggests that new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by BSE exposure.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The novel biology of prion propagation may not be unique to these rare degenerative brain diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	8	The human prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have been traditionally classified into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) and kuru.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	9	 They are rare neurodegenerative disorders affecting ~1 person per million world-wide per annum.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Despite their rarity, remarkable attention has been recently focused on these diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This is because of both their unique biology and concerns that the epidemic of a newly recognised bovine prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), could pose a threat to public health through dietary exposure to infected tissues.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	12	Transmissibility of the human diseases to experimental animals was demonstrated with the transmission, by intracerebral inoculation with brain homogenates into chimpanzees, of first kuru and then CJD in 1966 and 1968 respectively (1 ,2 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Transmission of GSS followed in 1981 (3 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The prototypic prion disease, scrapie, is a naturally occurring disease of sheep and goats, and has been recognised for >200 years (4 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Scrapie was demonstrated to be transmissible by inoculation in 1936 (5 ) and it was the recognition that histopathologically kuru, and then CJD, resembled scrapie that led to suggestions that these diseases may also be transmitted by inoculation (6 ,7 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Kuru is a neurodegenerative condition characterised principally by a progressive cerebellar ataxia which reached epidemic proportions amongst the Fore linguistic group in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea and which was transmitted by cannibalism.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Since the cessation of cannibalism in the 1950s the disease has declined but a few cases still occur as a result of the long incubation periods in this condition (8 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Transmission of CJD from case to case has occurred by a number of routes involving accidental inoculation with human prions as a result of medical procedures.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Such iatrogenic routes include the use of inadequately sterilised neurosurgical instruments, dura mater and corneal grafting, and use of human cadaveric pituitary derived growth hormone or gonadotrophin.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	20	The epidemiology of the human prion diseases encompasses the three aetiological types of prion disease: inherited, sporadic and acquired (Table 1 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Inherited cases constitute ~15% of cases, acquired cases (kuru and iatrogenic CJD) are rare.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Most human cases are sporadic, and their precise aetiology is still unclear.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both human and animal prion diseases share common histopathological features.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The classical triad of spongiform vacuolation (affecting any part of the cerebral grey matter), astrocytic proliferation and neuronal loss, may be accompanied by the deposition of amyloid plaques (9 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These plaques are composed principally of an abnormal, partially protease resistant isoform of a host encoded sialoglycoprotein, prion protein (PrP).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PrP is expressed widely but at much higher levels in neuronal cells as a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored cell surface protein (10 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	27	MOLECULAR GENETICS OF THE HUMAN PRION DISEASES AND A MODEL FOR PRION PROPAGATION.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	28	The transmissible agent, or prion, seems to consist principally of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP), designated PrPSc (11 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	29	 PrPSc is known to be derived from the cellular isoform, PrPC, by a post-translational mechanism (12 ,13 ) and evidence is mounting that this change is conformational rather than covalent (14 ,15 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	30	While PrPC is fully sensitive to proteolysis, PrPSc, which accumulates in the brain during disease, is partially protease resistant.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The human PrP gene (PRNP) is a single copy gene located on the short arm of chromosome 20 (16 ); it spans 16 kb and contains two exons (17 ,18 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The complete open reading frame of 759 nucleotides is contained within the larger second exon which comprises the majority of the 2.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	33	 A key advance in the understanding of prion biology was the identification of mutations in PRNP in the familial forms of the human diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The first mutation to be identified in PRNP was in a family with CJD and constituted a 144 bp insertion into the coding sequence (19 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A second mutation was reported in two families with GSS and genetic linkage was confirmed between this missense variant at codon 102 and GSS, confirming that GSS was an autosomal dominant Mendelian disorder (20 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This genetic variant was not present in the normal population but was rapidly identified in numerous other unrelated GSS kindreds.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These diseases are therefore both inherited in the germline and transmissible by inoculation, and are biologically unique in this regard.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	38	The identification of one of the pathogenic PrP gene mutations in a case with neurodegenerative disease allows not only molecular diagnosis of an inherited prion disease (21 ) [and pre-symptomatic testing of at risk individuals (22 )] but also its sub-classification according to mutation.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Pathogenic mutations reported to date in the human PrP gene consist of two groups: (i) point mutations within coding sequence resulting in amino acid substitutions in PrP or in one case production of a stop codon resulting in expression of a truncated PrP; (ii) insertions encoding additional integral copies of an octapeptide repeat present in a tandem array of five copies in the normal protein (Fig.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The availability of direct gene markers for these diseases has enabled identification of highly atypical cases and has widened the known phenotypic range of these disorders (23 ,24 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Remarkable phenotypic variability may be present in the same family, with phenotypes ranging from classical CJD to atypical dementias with extremely long duration and lacking the typical histological features of spongiform encephalopathy (25 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Clinical and pathological syndromes of the human inherited and other prion diseases are reviewed in detail elsewhere (26 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	43	Genetic susceptibility is also relevant to both the sporadic and acquired prion diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	44	 There is a common polymorphism of the human prion protein, with either methionine or valine present at residue 129.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In Caucasians, ~38% are homozygous for the more frequent methionine allele, 51% are heterozygotes and 11% are homozygous for valine (27 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The large majority of sporadic CJD occurs in individuals homozygous for this polymorphism (28 ) and most pituitary hormone related iatrogenic CJD cases are homozygotes, with a particular excess of valine homozygotes (29 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This protective effect of PRNP heterozygosity is also seen in some inherited prion diseases where the age at onset of disease is 1-2 decades later in heterozygotes at PRNP codon 129 as compared with homozygotes (30 ,31 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	48	Although prion diseases can be transmitted between mammalian species by inoculation, in practice it is difficult to do so, and typically transmission occurs in only a small proportion of inoculated animals and then only after prolonged incubation periods on primary passage.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	49	 On second and subsequent passage of infectivity into animals of the same species, incubation periods are typically much shortened, relatively synchronous as compared with primary passage, and all inoculated animals succumb to disease.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	50	 A key component of this so-called `species barrier' is the degree of homology between the PrP in the donor and recipient species.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Mice transgenic for hamster PrP lose their species barrier to hamster prions (32 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	52	 When such transgenic mice were challenged with mouse derived prions, the infectivity they produced was fully pathogenic for mice but not hamsters, while on challenge with hamster derived prions they produced prions fully pathogenic to hamsters but not mice.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The interpretation of this finding is that a direct interaction between PrP molecules occurs at some stage in the process of prion propagation and that such interaction occurs most easily if the interacting PrP molecules are identical.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Such work led to the idea that replication of prions may occur by PrPSc interacting directly with PrPC and catalysing the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (32 ,33 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Such an effect could then lead to a chain reaction of conversion leading to the progressive conversion of increasing amounts of PrPC to PrPSc.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The pathogenic mutations in the prion protein may result in the production of a protein that converts spontaneously to PrPSc in individuals with inherited prion diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Such a model provides an explanation of how a disease can be simultaneously inherited and transmissible.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The finding that nearly all sporadic CJD occurs in homozygotes with respect to a common and apparently innocent protein polymorphism lends strong support to such a mechanism (28 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Again prion protein interaction would occur most favourably in individuals with two identical copies of the prion protein.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Heterozygotes, producing two different proteins, would be somewhat protected, as if by an internal `species barrier'.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It is possible that the occasional individuals heterozygous at codon 129 who do develop sporadic CJD have a more prolonged illness although more detailed studies are required to investigate this further (34 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	62	 PrP valine 129 and PrP methionine 129 would be expected to differ slightly in their propensity to conversion to PrPSc.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The excess of PrP valine 129 homozygotes amongst human pituitary hormone related cases suggests that PrP valine 129 may be the more susceptible (29 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Pathogenic mutations reported to date in the human prion protein.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	65	The aetiology of sporadic CJD remains unclear.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	66	 It has been speculated that these cases might arise from somatic mutation of PRNP or spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc as a rare stochastic event.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The alternative hypothesis, that such cases arise as a result of exposure to an environmental source of either human or animal prions, is not supported by epidemiological evidence (35 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Since transgenic mice expressing extremely high levels of wild-type hamster or murine PrP develop a spontaneous neuromuscular disease (36 ), that appears to be transmissible, it has also been suggested that some cases of sporadic CJD may arise as a result of PrP overexpression.

0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	70	A high resolution structure of full length PrP has not yet been reported, but an NMR structure determination of a mouse PrP fragment spanning residues 121-231 represents an important step forward (37 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	71	 However, this structure lacks a highly conserved hydrophobic region (106-126), which contains several of the known pathogenic human mutations, as well as the N-terminal octapeptide repeat region, expansion of which by integral numbers of repeat elements results in a group of inherited prion diseases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The conformation of this repeat region has been studied by circular dichroism and appears to form an extended, flexible domain with properties similar to the poly-L-proline type II helix (38 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	73	 It has been hypothesised that this may form a low specificity binding domain.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	74	Despite the wealth of evidence indicating the central role of PrP in these diseases, its normal cellular function remains unclear.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Mice homozygous for PrP null alleles appear to develop and behave normally (39 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Such mice are completely resistant to developing prion disease following inoculation and do not propagate infectivity (40 ,41 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	77	 However, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated impaired GABAA mediated synaptic inhibition in hippocampal brain slices maintained in vitro and also reduced long-term potentiation (42 ), an abnormality independently confirmed in a different PrP knockout line (43 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	78	 However, others have failed to replicate this finding, albeit using different techniques and experimental conditions (44 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	79	 That this phenotype is rescued by expression of human PrP in such mice confirmed its specificity for PrP (45 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	80	 These abnormalities of synaptic inhibition are reminiscent of the neurophysiological abnormalities seen in patients with CJD and in scrapie infected mice (46 ), raising the possibility that prion neurodegeneration may be, at least in part, due to loss of PrP function rather than to a deleterious effect of PrPSc (42 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The relative normality of PrP null mice, which do not develop progressive neurodegeneration, could result from effective adaptive changes during neurodevelopment.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	82	 It is possible that the sequestration of PrPC into PrPSc during prion disease in a developed nervous system lacking such plasticity has more severe consequences.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Certainly, PrPSc does not appear to be toxic to cells lacking PrPC (47 ) and PrPSc is difficult to detect in some cases of the inherited human prion disease fatal familial insomnia (FFI) (48 ), and in transgenic mice infected experimentally with FFI (49 ), suggesting that, at least in these cases, neurodegeneration may not be the result of PrPSc toxicity.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	84	 According to such a model, the gain of function implied by the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance could reflect the formation of PrPSc which then functionally depletes PrPC by a dominant negative effect.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	85	Two additional phenotypes have now been described in PrP null mice, abnormalities of circadian rhythms (50 ) and cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration (51 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Further neurophysiological abnormalities in the hippocampus of PrP null mice, including disrupted Ca2+-activated K+ currents and abnormal intrinsic properties of CA1 pyramidal cells have recently been reported (52 ,53 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the `new variant' putatively linked to BSE.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	88	Extensive epidemiological studies of CJD have been performed in a number of countries and all obtained broadly similar results (35 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The overall annual incidence in most studies was ~1 case per million.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	90	 No significant case clustering is present other than with respect to familial clusters.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Cases are distributed apparently at random with a frequency related only to local population density.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In particular, there is no evidence for case-to-case spread or association with local scrapie prevalence.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	93	 For instance, CJD is as common in Australia and New Zealand, which have been scrapie free for many years, as in the UK where scrapie is endemic.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Numerous case control studies have not shown consistent associations with particular occupational groups or dietary components.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	95	The core clinical syndrome of CJD is of a rapidly progressive dementia usually with myoclonus.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The onset is usually in the 45-75 year age group with peak onset between 60-65.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Sporadic CJD is exceedingly rare in individuals under age 30.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The clinical progression is typically over weeks progressing to akinetic mutism and death often in 2-3 months.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Around 70% of cases die in under 6 months.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	100	However, in late 1995 two cases of sporadic CJD were reported in the UK in teenagers (54 ,55 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Only four cases of sporadic CJD had previously been recorded in the literature in teenagers, and none of these cases occurred in the UK.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In addition, both cases were unusual in having kuru-type plaques, a finding seen in only ~5% of CJD cases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Soon afterwards a third very young sporadic CJD case occurred (56 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	104	 These cases caused considerable concern and the possibility was raised that they might suggest a link with BSE.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	105	 By March 1996, further extremely young onset cases were apparent and review of the histology of these cases showed a remarkably consistent and unique pattern (57 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	106	 These cases were named `new variant' CJD although it was clear that they were also rather atypical in their clinical presentation; in fact most cases did not meet the accepted clinical diagnostic criteria for probable CJD (57 ) and, in some respects at least, clinically more closely resembled kuru (58 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Extensive studies of archival cases of CJD or other prion diseases failed to show this picture and it seemed that this did represent the arrival of a new form of prion disease in the UK.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The statistical probability of such cases occurring by chance was vanishingly small and ascertainment bias seemed most unlikely as an explanation.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It was clear that a new risk factor for CJD had emerged and appeared to be specific to the UK.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The UK Government advisory committee on spongiform encephalopathy (SEAC) concluded that, while there was no direct evidence for a link with BSE, exposure to specified bovine offal (SBO) prior to the ban on its inclusion in human foodstuffs in 1989, was the most likely explanation.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	111	 A case of the new variant was reported in France soon after (59 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	112	 PRNP analysis showed that all cases available for study were homozygous, for methionine at codon 129, and that no known or novel pathogenic mutations were found in PRNP coding sequence (60 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Recently, transmission of BSE to three macaques has been reported, with production of histopathological appearances that are closely similar to the very unusual pattern of pathology seen in new variant CJD (61 ), providing further evidence that these cases may result from BSE transmission.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	114	 However, detailed comparisons with transmissions of typical CJD cases to macaques will be needed to fully evaluate the significance of this finding.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	115	If these cases do represent transmission of BSE to humans it is unclear why none had a pattern of unusual occupational or dietary exposure to BSE; it is possible that they represent a genetically susceptible sub-population.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In addition, it is unknown why this age group should be particularly affected.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, little is known about which foodstuffs contained high-titre bovine offal.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	118	 It is possible that certain foods containing particularly high titres were eaten predominately by younger people.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is also possible that children have an inherently higher intrinsic susceptibility or shorter incubation period following dietary exposure to the BSE agent.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Possibilities might include, for example, differences in gut permeability or lymphoreticular system or higher PrP expression levels.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	121	Direct experimental evidence that new variant CJD may be caused by BSE was provided by molecular analysis of human prion strains (PrPSc typing) (see below).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The identification of a biochemical marker that distinguished new variant CJD from previously recognised forms of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD confirmed that this was a novel variant and implied that it was caused by exposure to a single novel prion strain type (62 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The lack of any history of iatrogenic exposure to humans in these patients suggested that this was a novel animal prion.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The molecular strain characteristics of new variant CJD closely resembled those seen in BSE itself and BSE transmitted to mice, domestic cat and macaque, consistent with BSE being the origin of new variant CJD (62 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Such PrPSc markers are detectable in tonsil (63 ), which may allow pre-mortem diagnosis of new variant CJD without brain biopsy, and may potentially allow earlier diagnosis.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	126	Experimental transmission studies of the human prion diseases have, until recently, largely involved transmission to laboratory primates, in particular chimpanzees and squirrel monkeys.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The extensive experience of the NIH group, reporting >300 successful transmissions has recently been summarised (64 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, transmission studies in primates are severely limited by the expense of such studies and by ethical concerns as to the use of primates in such work.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Attempts by most laboratories to transmit human prions to rodents have been fairly unsuccessful, with only occasional transmissions occurring and then at very prolonged incubation periods close to the natural lifespan of the mice.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Some groups have, however, reported more frequent transmissions (65 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Recently transgenic mice have become available which have increased susceptibility to human prions.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Mice expressing a chimaeric human/mouse PrP were susceptible to three CJD isolates with short incubation periods (66 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It has now become clear that transgenic mice expressing wild-type human PrP, but not mouse PrP, are highly susceptible to CJD, with all inoculated mice succumbing at short incubation periods usually in the range of 180-220 days (67 ,68 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Such mice appear to lack a species barrier to human prions and can now be used for extensive studies of the transmission characteristics of human prion diseases and to bioassay human prions (68 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Molecular basis of prion strains.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	136	A major problem for the `protein-only' hypothesis of prion propagation has been how to explain the existence of multiple isolates or strains of prions.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Such strains are distinguished by their biological properties: they produce distinct incubation periods and patterns of neuropathological targeting in inbred mouse lines.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	138	 As they can be serially propagated in inbred mice with the same Prn-p genotype they cannot be encoded by differences in PrP primary structure.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Furthermore, strains can be re-isolated in mice after passage in intermediate species with different PrP primary structures (69 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Understanding how a protein-only infectious agent could encode such phenotypic information has been of considerable biological interest.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	141	Support for the contention that strain specificity is encoded by PrP alone is provided by study of two distinct strains of transmissible mink encephalopathy prions which can be serially propagated in hamsters, designated hyper (HY) and drowsy (DY) (70 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	142	 These strains can be distinguished by differing physiochemical properties of the accumulated PrPSc in the brains of affected hamsters (71 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Following limited proteolysis, strain specific migration patterns of PrPSc on polyacrylamide gels can be seen.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	144	 DY PrPSc appears to be more protease sensitive than HY PrPSc producing a different banding pattern of PrPSc on Western blots following proteinase K treatment.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	145	 This relates to different N-terminal ends of HY and DY PrPSc following protease treatment and implies differing conformations of HY and DY PrPSc (72 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Furthermore, the demonstration that these strain specific physiochemical properties can be maintained during in vitro production of protease resistant PrP, when PrPC is mixed with HY or DY hamster PrPSc, further supports the concept that prion strains involve different PrP conformers (73 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	147	Recently, several human PrPSc types have been identified which are associated with different phenotypes of CJD (62 ,74 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The different fragment sizes seen on Western blots following treatment with proteinase K suggests that there are several different human PrPSc conformations.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, to fulfil the criteria of strains, these patterns must be transmissible to animals both in same and in different species.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Remarkably, this is the case, with both PrPSc fragment sizes and the ratios of the three PrP glycoforms (diglycosylated, monoglycosylated and unglycosylated PrP) maintained on passage in transgenic mice expressing human PrP (62 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Transmission of human prions and bovine prions to wild-type mice results in murine PrPSc with fragment sizes and glycoform ratios which correspond to the original inoculum (62 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	152	 New variant CJD is associated with PrPSc glycoform ratios which are distinct from those seen in classical CJD.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Similar ratios are seen in BSE and BSE when transmitted to several other species (62 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These data strongly support the `protein only' hypothesis of infectivity and suggest that strain variation is encoded by a combination of PrP conformation and glycosylation.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Transmission of PrPSc fragment sizes from two different sub-types of inherited prion disease to transgenic mice expressing a chimaeric human mouse PrP has also been reported (75 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	156	 As PrP glycosylation is thought to be a co-translational process, the different glycoform ratios may represent selection of particular PrPC glycoforms by PrPSc of different conformations.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	157	 According to such a hypothesis, PrP conformation would be the primary determinant of strain type with glycosylation being involved as a secondary process.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, since it is known that different cell types may glycosylate proteins differently, PrPSc glycosylation patterns may provide a substrate for the neuropathological targeting that distinguishes different prion strains.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Particular PrPSc glycoforms may replicate most favourably in neuronal populations with a similar PrP glycoform expressed on the cell surface.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Such targeting could also explain the different incubation periods which also discriminate strains, targeting of more critical brain regions, or regions with higher levels of PrP expression, producing shorter incubation periods.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	161	Such studies may allow a new molecular classification of human prion diseases; it is likely that additional PrPSc types or strains will be identified.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This may well open new avenues of epidemiological investigation and offer insights into causes of `sporadic' CJD.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In addition, PrPSc typing can be applied to other species; it is already apparent that PrP glycoform analysis alone can distinguish a number of mouse passaged scrapie strains (76 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The combination of fragment size and glycoform analysis should allow better resolution and might be applied, for instance, to study if BSE has transmitted to other species involved in the human diet such as sheep.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	165	 It will be necessary to study the full range of sheep strains to determine whether these can all be distinguished at a molecular level from BSE, it is possible that more refined molecular techniques may be necessary (77 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Classical strain typing, involving mouse transmissions, takes 1-2 years and can only be applied to limited numbers of cases.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Molecular strain typing takes days and allows large scale screening.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	168	The ability of a protein to encode a disease phenotype has important implications in biology, as it represents a non-Mendelian form of transmission.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	169	 It would be surprising, and also itself intriguing, if evolution had not used this mechanism for other proteins in a range of species.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The recent identification of prion-like mechanisms in yeast is particularly interesting in this regard (78 ,79 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Bovine to human species barrier.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	172	As BSE appears to have transmitted to humans, a key issue is the extent of the bovine to human species barrier.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Clearly, this cannot be measured directly since this would require inoculation of humans with BSE.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, transgenic models may offer a way to address this issue, at least in part.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The principal determinants of the `species barrier' are the degree of homology between PrP molecules in the host and inoculum (32 ) and strain of agent; however, BSE appears to be caused by a single prion strain (69 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Transgenic mice expressing human PrP, which are competent to produce human PrPSc and `human' prions on CJD challenge, offer an opportunity to address the issue as to whether it is possible for bovine prions to induce production of human PrPSc.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	177	 To date results are reassuring.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Incubation periods to BSE were unaltered in mice expressing human PrP in addition to mouse PrP, and only mouse PrPSc appeared to be produced (68 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	179	 A potentially more revealing experiment is to challenge mice expressing only human PrP with BSE (68 ).
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	180	 No transmission occurred at incubation periods well beyond those of CJD in these mice (68 ); it remains to be seen if transmission will occur at longer incubation periods.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	181	 These mice express valine at polymorphic codon 129 of PRNP and these studies are being repeated with mice transgenic for human PrP methionine 129.
0.1370075.9300662.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This is of particular importance given that all new variant CJD cases seen to date are methionine 129 homozygotes.

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	2	From the Medical Research Council Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square, London, WC1N 3BG, United Kingdom and Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, United Kingdom.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, December 16, 2003 , and in revised form, March 24, 2004.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	4	According to the "protein-only" hypothesis (6), prions are composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of host-encoded prion protein (PrP) (7).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The disease-related isoform, PrPSc, is derived from its normal cellular precursor, PrPC, by a post-translational process that involves conformational change.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	6	 PrPSc can be distinguished biochemically from PrPC by its partial protease resistance and detergent insolubility.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	7	Although the precise molecular events involved in this conversion remain ill defined, molecular genetic and in vitro studies support the hypothesis that some sort of direct interaction between PrPSc and either PrPC or some less organized state occurs.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This interaction results in the PrPSc conformation being imposed upon the substrate protein, and the process of conversion is favored by sequence complementarity (8 to 13).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A key piece of evidence supporting this and the protein-only hypothesis in general is the finding that the large majority of cases of sporadic CJD are homozygous with respect to a common polymorphism at position 129 in the human prion protein, in which either methionine or valine can be encoded (only 49% of the UK population are homozygous with respect to this polymorphism) (9).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	10	Elderly survivors of the kuru epidemic (an acquired prion disease largely restricted to the Fore linguistic group of the Papua New Guinea Highlands, which was transmitted during endocannibalistic feasts) who had multiple exposures at mortuary feasts, are, in marked contrast to younger unexposed Fore, predominantly PRNP 129 heterozygotes.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Kuru imposed strong balancing selection on the Fore, essentially eliminating PRNP 129 homozygotes.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	12	 World-wide PRNP haplotype diversity and coding allele frequencies have suggested that strong balancing selection at this locus occurred during the evolution of modern humans (14).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	13	This polymorphism is crucial to the etiology and neuropathology of prion disease; to date, only individuals homozygous for methionine (Met/Met) have succumbed to variant CJD (3, 15, 16), and iatrogenic CJD occurs predominately in homozygotes with an excess of valine homozygotes in cases related to exposure to contaminated human pituitary hormones (17).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The importance of sequence homology is further emphasized by the observation that in some families with inherited prion diseases, the age of onset is significantly later in individuals heterozygous to this polymorphism (18 to 21).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Thus, heterozygosity with respect to this polymorphism appears to confer substantial resistance to prion disease.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	16	Perhaps more fundamentally, this polymorphism is also associated with the propagation of distinct human prion "isolates" or strains seen in different CJD phenotypes.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Prion strains can be distinguished by their biological properties: distinct incubation periods, clinical features, and pattern of neuropathological targeting in experimental animals.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is now apparent that human prion strains are associated with the different biochemical features of PrPSc, with differences in PrPSc conformation and glycosylation that can be serially propagated in transgenic mice expressing human PrP (3, 5).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The residue 129 HuPrP polymorphism appears to be able to affect the generation of these strain-specific PrPSc conformers and by inference the phenotype of human prion disease (22, 23).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Such phenotypic effects of this polymorphism are also seen in inherited prion disease associated with the D178N mutation in PRNP, where this mutation may result in the phenotype of CJD or fatal familial insomnia, depending on the 129 genotype of the mutant allele (24).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	21	Further, there are multiple distinct molecular forms of human PrPSc identified by molecular strain-typing studies (5, 22, 25, 26).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These are thought to represent distinct conformational states of PrPSc that differ in either the fold of the individual polypeptide chains or in the manner in which the chains are packed in a multimolecular complex or both.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These states are manifested at the molecular level by (a) their response to cleavage by proteinase K and subsequent sizing of the resistant segment of polypeptide chain by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and (b) the ratio of diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated forms found in the protease-resistant PrPSc material.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These PrPSc types are associated with distinct clinico-pathological phenotypes in affected patients.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Types 1 to 3 are associated with classical CJD, whereas variant CJD is only associated with the type 4 strain (5).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The propagation of these strain types is highly dependent upon the codon 129 genotype and hence the primary structure of the prion protein.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For instance, the type 1 strain is only seen in methionine homozygotes, whereas the type 3 strain has not been seen on this genetic background.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Most strikingly, variant CJD has only been seen to date in homozygous MM individuals.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	29	This polymorphism is thus fundamental to prion disease in humans, and therefore an understanding of its influence on PrP folding may provide strong clues as to the molecular mechanisms that underlie prion propagation.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Current theories concentrate on the differing abilities for methionine or valine to be accommodated within -sheet structure or the thermodynamic stabilities of both forms of PrPC, both of which are thought to affect the propensity of PrPC to convert to PrPSc (17, 27, 28).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	31	As a first step in characterizing this polymorphism, its effect on the three-dimensional structure of the valine form of PrPC has been determined.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Here we describe the influence of the polymorphism on the fold stability, solution dynamics, and unfolding characteristics of the normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPC).

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This is of particular interest, since a D178N mutation is associated with a clinico-pathological phenotype of FFI when residue 129 is methionine and of CJD when it is valine.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	127	 It has been proposed that the side chains of residues 129 and 178 interact via hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Tyr128, Arg164, and Asp178 (24, 53) (although in the averaged NMR structure of HuPrP(129M), the side chain of Arg164 is not in a position to accomplish this (51)).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The side chains of these residues are well defined in the HuPrP(129V) NMR structure, and NOEs between the backbone and side chain resonances of residues 128, 129, 164, and 178 are observed.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	129	 From the distribution of conformations within the NMR ensemble, it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether the side chains of Tyr128, Arg164, and Asp178 are hydrogen-bonded to each other, but these residues are sufficiently close in individual members of the ensemble for this hydrogen-bonding to be present.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Hence, the close association of the side chains of residues 128, 164, and 178 is maintained in both polymorphs, and there does not appear to be a significant disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network surrounding residue 129 (Fig.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This conclusion is further supported by amide exchange and chemical shift data described below.

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	150	To investigate this, the rates of hydrogen/deuterium exchange for backbone amide resonances were determined, which has been used to identify regions of the protein that remain hydrogen-bonded until the protein becomes unfolded (Fig.

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The former displays anomalously high protection factors, due to residual local structure in the unfolded state of the protein (55).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The latter region, however, displays protection factors that are below the detectable limit (50 under the conditions of the present experiment).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, protection factors for residues 161 and 163, which are on the other strand of the -sheet, exhibit similar protection factors in both forms of PrPC.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus, although we can say that substitution of valine for methionine has not significantly increased the stability of hydrogen bonds surrounding residue 129 to a level where protection is observable (50), it does not appear to have significantly affected the stability of hydrogen bonds associated with the opposite side of the -sheet.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	159	 We can therefore conclude that for both forms of HuPrP, there are no significantly populated species, either folding intermediates or alternatively folded states in which the three helical and second -strand core of the protein is disrupted, and that the effect of the polymorphism on PrPC (if any) is likely to be outside of this core region.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	160	Some secondary structure elements of the protein show very little protection from exchange.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	161	 For example, the C-terminal regions of helix II (residues 186 to 194) and helix III (residues 219 to 226) and the first strand of the -sheet exhibit protection factors below the detectable limit, consistent with a significant level of conformational flexibility in these regions of the protein.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In the case of the -sheet, this conclusion is supported by weak, broadened 1H15N HSQC signals observed from this region (residues 129 to 131 and 161 to 164), whereas for the helical regions, although downfield-shifted C chemical shifts characteristic of -helical structure are observed, the downfield shift is reduced, consistent with these regions being in equilibrium with more unfolded structures (data not shown).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	163	The higher conformational variability in the C termini of these helices in comparison with the core of the protein is further supported by small chemical shift differences between the M and V polymorphs.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These chemical shift differences are small but lie outside the uncertainty in measurement.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The changes in C chemical shifts indicate that there is a slight stabilization of the C terminus of helix III, and destabilization of the C terminus of Helix II in HuPrP(129V) compared with HuPrP(129M).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In previous studies, chemical shift differences in these regions of the protein between different PrP constructs have been variously ascribed to small pH differences between samples or to transient interactions between the folded domain and the unstructured N terminus of the protein (51, 56).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The chemical shift differences observed here lie outside those caused by uncertainty in the precise pH of the solutions and indicate a difference in the distribution of stability throughout the molecule, implying a possible role for the polymorphism.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Chemical shift changes immediately adjacent to the polymorphism are, however, harder to interpret, since there are inevitably changes that are associated with the change in chemical composition.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Indeed, the sequence surrounding a residue can cause a change in C chemical shift on the order of  plus or minus 0.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	170	3 ppm in unfolded proteins, which is larger than the chemical shift changes observed adjacent to the polymorphism (57).
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Any changes in conformation reported by these chemical shift perturbations are small, since they do not affect the observed structure or stability of the protein and reflect small changes in the population distribution of the structural ensemble, which fall within the resolution of the solution structure.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	172	Spin Relaxation Measurements In order to further characterize the conformational dynamics of both polymorphs and in particular the regions of low amide protection and conformational variability, both constructs were probed using 15N spin relaxation measurements (Fig.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	173	 4), which provide information on flexibility within the protein.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The steady-state 15N{1H} NOEs and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 (15N) and T2 (15N)) for the folded, well defined, regions of HuPrP(129V) are characteristic of a globular protein of this size.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In particular, residues within the -sheet region, where the polymorphism resides, do not exhibit dynamic properties significantly different from the rest of the protein, despite the low amide protection factors and broadened 15N1H HSQC signals.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Residues 190 to 199, however, which link helices II and III, display smaller but still positive 15N{1H} NOE values (and slightly increased T2 values), indicating that these residues are indeed relatively more flexible than the structured parts of the protein, resulting in the decreased definition in the NMR structure ensemble for this region.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The degree of flexibility for this region is still significantly less than the N and C termini of the protein (residues 91 to 124 and 227 to 231), which display large negative 15N{1H} NOE values indicative of molecular motions on the subnanosecond time scale, consistent with previous observations that they are unstructured.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The increased flexibility within the C terminus of helix III appears to extend to residue 220 and is consistent with the lack of amide exchange and the reduced downfield C chemical shifts.

0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	185	  Overall, the spin relaxation properties of both polymorphs are very similar.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In particular, the region surrounding the residue 129 polymorphism shows remarkably little difference in spin relaxation values for both constructs, with slight changes in the 15N{1H} NOE for HuPrP(129V) suggestive of only a slight increase in conformational mobility surrounding the polymorphism.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	187	The above arguments establish the general point that the residue 129 polymorphism confers different molecular properties on the prion protein and that these properties strongly influence both susceptibility to disease and the conformation of PrPSc.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	188	 It follows that an understanding of the mechanism underlying this methionine/valine effect would provide valuable insights into the process by which the cellular conformation of the protein is converted to the disease-related PrPSc state.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	189	 To this end, we addressed the question of whether the influence of the M and V residues at this position results from changes in the conformation and stability of PrPC.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Our results establish a close similarity of the valine and methionine forms of the protein in the PrPC conformation.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	191	 No obvious effect on the side chain packing or dynamics in the region surrounding the mutation are discernible in the structural ensemble calculated from NOE-derived constraints, and chemical shift data for this region also show remarkably little difference between the two sequences.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In addition, the polymorphism does not affect the global stability of the molecule, as evidenced by the lack of effect on the denaturant-induced unfolding transition and on the hydrogen exchange behavior.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The latter measurements also probe the propensity for local regions of the protein to unfold or for the protein to adopt less stable, alternative conformations.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In these respects, also, the methionine and valine forms behave identically.
0.13729805.15123682.html.plaintext.txt	195	From these observations, it seems likely that the influence of residue 129 on prion disease results from its effect on the conformational properties of PrPSc, such that the type 1 and type 4 conformations are formed only by the methionine variant, whereas type 3 is favored by valine and the type 2 conformation is formed equally well by either.

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	2	Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that occur naturally in man and in a variety of other animals.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	3	 They include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)1 in cattle, and several human diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Since its first recognition in 1986, BSE reached epidemic proportions in the UK (1), and there is substantial evidence that a new variant of CJD may be because of consumption of BSE-contaminated products (2).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	5	The unusual properties of the transmissible agent, or prion, early on suggested that it might be devoid of nucleic acid (3).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Currently, the most widely accepted proposal is the "protein only" hypothesis, first outlined in general terms by Griffith (4) and enunciated in its updated and detailed form by Prusiner (5, 6).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	7	 It proposes that the prion is identical with a conformational isoform of PrPC (5), a normal host protein (7-9) found predominantly on the outer surface of neurons.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Introduction of the abnormal conformer into the organism would result in the conversion of PrPC into a likeness of itself (Fig.

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A, in the normal cell PrPC is synthesized, transported to the cell surface and recycled.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	11	 B, the protein only model assumes that the prion is identical with PrPSc (or PrP*).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Exogenous prions cause the conversion of the normal cellular protein PrPC into PrPSc, either at the cell surface or after internalization.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	13	 C, PrPSc accumulates intracellularly in late endosomes or lysosomes, and the cell surface is depleted of PrPC.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	14	 PrPSc is also released into the extracellular space.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	15	During the course of prion disease, a largely protease-resistant, aggregated form of PrP, designated PrPSc, accumulates mainly in brain (7, 10).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Prusiner and co-workers (11) proposed that PrPSc is the main or only constituent of the prion.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Because no chemical differences were found between PrPC and PrPSc, the two species are believed to differ in their conformation.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The three-dimensional structure of PrPC has been elucidated (12) but not that of PrPSc; however, the -sheet content of PrPSc was found to be high whereas that of PrPC is low (13).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Because the ratio of infectious units to PrPSc molecules is only about 1:100,000 (14), the structure of the PrP molecule actually associated with infectivity cannot be definitively inferred.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	20	 For this reason the PrP species responsible for infectivity is presently better designated as PrP* (15).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The conclusion that some form of PrP is the essential (perhaps only) constituent of the infectious agent is based on compelling biochemical and genetical evidence (5, 16).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	22	     Familial Spongiform Encephalopathies Are Associated with Mutations in the PrP Gene.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	23	Although most cases of human prion disease are sporadic, about 10% are familial and linked to one of a number of mutations in the PrP gene (Fig.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It is believed that these mutations allow spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc with a frequency sufficient to cause disease within the lifetime of the individual (5, 19).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Sporadic CJD could be attributed to rare instances of spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc or rare somatic mutations in the Prnp gene.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In both cases the initial conversion would be followed by autocatalytic propagation.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Mice overexpressing a murine PrP transgene with a mutation corresponding to the human GSS mutation Pro-102  Leu spontaneously contract a lethal scrapie-like disease, and it has been reported that this disease can be transmitted to mice expressing the same mutant transgene at lower levels, which do not lead to spontaneous disease (20, 21).

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The red arrows indicate amino acid replacements in individual mutant PrP genes.

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The Met-129  Val replacement represents a polymorphism, which in itself is not associated with disease; however, it modifies the effects of the Asp-178  Asn mutation, such that when the latter is combined with Met-129 it is associated with FFI and when combined with Val-129 it is associated with CJD.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Amplification of the number of octa repeats has been found in cases of familial CJD and GSS.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	35	     Mice Devoid of PrPC Are Resistant to Scrapie.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	36	The "protein only" hypothesis predicts that in the absence of PrPC mice should be resistant to scrapie and fail to multiply the infectious agent.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Mice devoid of PrP (Prnpo/o) were generated by homologous recombination and found to be essentially normal (22).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	38	 When challenged with mouse prions, mice devoid of PrP were completely protected against scrapie disease, and prions failed to accumulate in spleen and brain, in contrast to wild-type mice (23, 24).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Introduction of murine Prnp transgenes into Prnpo/o mice resulted in several lines with varying expression levels of PrPC, which were susceptible to mouse prions; the higher the PrPC content of the brain, the shorter the incubation times (25).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	40	The demonstration that disruption of the PrP gene confers resistance to scrapie and that reintroduction of a PrP-encoding transgene restores susceptibility paved the way to reverse genetics of PrP, that is the introduction of deletions or mutations into the Prnp gene and determination of the capacity of the modified gene to confer susceptibility to scrapie to a PrP knockout mouse.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Transgenes encoding PrP with deletions extending to codon 93, but not to 106, restored susceptibility to scrapie (25).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	42	2     Transport of Prions from the Periphery to the CNS.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	43	Acquired forms of prion diseases are mostly transmitted through oral uptake of prions or peripheral administration, raising the question as to how the agent finds its way to the CNS.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	44	Prnp+/+ neuroectodermal tissue introduced into the brain of newly born Prnpo/o mice develops into differentiated Prnp+/+ nervous tissue.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Intracerebral inoculation of such engrafted mice leads to typical scrapie pathology in the graft but not in the surrounding Prnpo/o tissue (26).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, because intraperitoneal inoculation of these mice does not lead to pathology in the Prnp+/+ graft, transport of prions from the periphery to the CNS is seen to require interposed PrP-bearing tissue (27).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	47	 It has also been shown that Prnp+/+ immunodeficient mice lacking mature B cells fail to transport prions from the periphery to the CNS, suggesting a role of the lymphoreticular system in transport (28).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	48	 It is believed that the follicular dendritic cells, which depend on B cells for their maintenance in a mature state, are the site of prion replication in the spleen (29, 30) and that transport to the CNS is, in addition, dependent on the peripheral nervous system (31).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	49	     The Species Barrier Is Abolished by Introducing the PrP Transgene of the Prion Donor into the Recipient.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	50	Prions are transmitted from one species to another much less efficiently, if at all, than within the same species and only after prolonged incubation times.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In the case of prion transmission from hamsters to mice, this so-called species barrier was overcome by introducing hamster Prnp transgenes into recipient wild-type mice (32, 33).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Importantly, the properties of the prions produced in these transgenic mice corresponded to the prion species used for inoculation (32), that is infection with hamster prions led to production of hamster prions, but infection with mouse prions gave rise to mouse prions.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Within the framework of the "protein only" hypothesis this means that hamster PrPC but not murine PrPC (which differs from the former by 10 amino acids) is a suitable substrate for conversion to hamster PrPSc by hamster prions and vice versa.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Interestingly, susceptibility of the mouse to prions from other species, such as hamster, mouse, or man, is increased when the PrP transgenes are introduced into a PrP knockout mouse, suggesting that the resident murine gene inhibits the propagation of the alien prions (23).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	55	     The Puzzle of Prion Strains.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	56	Dickinson and colleagues (34, 35) showed that many distinct strains of scrapie prions can be derived from sheep isolates.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These strains differ by their incubation times in various inbred mouse lines and by the lesion patterns they occasion in the affected brains.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Interestingly, different strains can be propagated in one inbred mouse strain (homozygous with regard to its PrP gene) (35).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Within the framework of the protein only hypothesis this is at first blush puzzling, because it means that one and the same polypeptide chain is able to mediate different strain phenotypes.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The conformational hypothesis proposes that each strain is associated with a different conformation of PrPSc (or PrP*) and that each of these can convert the PrPC of its host into a likeness of itself (19).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Marsh and colleagues (36) showed that the PrPSc species associated with two hamster-adapted scrapie strains, HY and DY, are cleaved to products of different length by proteinase K; the different susceptibility to protease is readily explained by different conformations.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Similar findings were made with other prion strains propagated in the mouse (37, 38).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Moreover, PrPSc of certain strains differ in the ratio of the diglycosylated to the monoglycosylated form (39).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	64	Is it possible that a dozen different strains of prions can differ in regard to the conformation of the PrPSc they are associated with and that all these conformations can "breed true"? It has recently been claimed that PrPSc molecules of as many as eight different strains could be differentiated by virtue of their relative affinity for a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope that is fully available in PrPC but partially occluded in PrPSc.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In addition, some strains differed in their susceptibility to denaturation by guanidinium chloride, adding further credibility to the conformational hypothesis of strain specificity (40).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	66	Conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in scrapie-infected cells is a late post-translational process, occurring after PrPC has reached its normal extracellular location or thereafter (41).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Why is spontaneous formation of PrPSc an extremely rare event and how does scrapie infection promote conversion? The "refolding model" (Fig.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	68	 3A) proposes that conversion requires that PrPC be unfolded to some extent and refolded under the influence of a PrPSc molecule (19), a process that would have to overcome a high activation energy barrier and might require a chaperone and an energy source.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	69	 3B) proposes that PrPC is in equilibrium with PrPSc (or a precursor thereof) and that PrPSc is only stabilized when it adds onto a crystal-like seed or aggregate of PrPSc.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	70	 If a stable aggregate needs to consist minimally of a substantial number of PrPSc molecules, then its spontaneous formation would be a very rare event.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	71	 However, once a seed is present, monomer addition could ensue at a rapid rate (42-44).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Trapping of PrP by essentially irreversible aggregation would drive the bulk conversion process.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The proposed process is akin to the assembly of (protease-sensitive) flagellin to (protease-resistant) flagellar filaments (45).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Interestingly, the same flagellin molecule can assemble into two types of flagella, depending on the provenance of the seed (46), thereby providing an analogy for conformationally determined prion strain specificity.

0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The conformational change is kinetically controlled, a high activation energy barrier preventing spontaneous conversion at detectable rates.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Interaction with exogenously introduced PrPSc causes PrPC to undergo an induced conformational change to yield PrPSc.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	79	 This reaction may involve extensive unfolding and refolding of the protein to explain the postulated high energy barrier and could be dependent on an enzyme or chaperone.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In the case of certain mutations in PrPC (see Fig.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	81	 2), spontaneous conversion to PrPSc may occur as a rare event, explaining why familial CJD or GSS arises spontaneously, albeit late in life.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Sporadic CJD may come about when an extremely rare event (occurring in one among a million individuals per year) leads to spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and gives rise to a conversion cascade (5, 32).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	83	 PrPC and PrPSc (or a PrPSc-like molecule) are in equilibrium strongly favoring PrPC.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	84	 PrPSc is only stabilized when it adds onto a crystal-like seed or aggregate of PrPSc.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Seed formation is a rare event; once a seed is present, monomer addition can ensue at a rapid rate (43, 44).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To explain exponential conversion rates, it must be assumed that the aggregates are continuously fragmented to present increasing surface for accretion.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	87	Caughey and colleagues (47) have shown that incubation of 35S-labeled PrPC with PrPSc yields a radioactive product that resembled PrPSc with regard to its protease resistance.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The conversion reaction exhibited the "species specificity" observed in vivo; thus PrPC from mouse was readily converted to protease resistance by murine PrPSc but poorly by bovine PrPSc and vice versa (48).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Moreover, even strain specificity has been demonstrated in this type of reaction, in that labeled PrPC incubated with PrPSc from the DY or the HY hamster transmissible mink encephalopathy strains described above yielded labeled PrPSc with the properties typical for the input PrPSc (49).
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Despite efforts by several groups, it has not been possible to demonstrate net synthesis of infectivity over the background given by the PrPSc preparation.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	91	Although each individual piece of evidence described above could be explained in several ways, the conjunction of data strongly supports the proposal that the prion is composed partly or entirely of a PrP-derived molecule (PrP* or PrPSc) and that protein-encoding nucleic acid is not an essential component.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Probably the closest one could come to irrefutable proof for the protein only hypothesis would be the demonstration that biosynthetic, pure PrPC can be converted not only into a protease-resistant form but to infectious scrapie agent under defined conditions in vitro.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	93	Many questions still need to be elucidated, in particular the mechanism and the requirements for the conversion reaction, the transport of the prion from periphery to CNS, and the mechanism of pathogenesis, to name but a few.
0.13843356.9867802.html.plaintext.txt	94	 From a practical side, early diagnosis of prion disease and treatments aimed at arresting or reversing the disease in humans are important goals.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	3	Key words: Drosophila eye, Morphogenetic furrow, Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic, Notch, Delta.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	4	Progression of the morphogenetic furrow depends primarily on Hedgehog, which is secreted by differentiating photoreceptor neurons.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Hedgehog is necessary for furrow progression (Ma et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Ectopic Hh expression is sufficient to initiate ectopic furrows in the anterior undifferentiated region (Heberlein et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Despite the primary role of Hh, cells unable to receive Hh signals are still able to differentiate because Hh triggers the secretion of secondary signals, and cells unable to respond to Hh still respond to these other signals (Strutt and Mlodzik, 1997).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Dpp is one important secondary signal, and acts redundantly with Hh.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Cells must be able to respond to either Hh or Dpp to begin differentiating (Heberlein et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	10	, 1993; Greenwood and Struhl, 1999; Curtiss and Mlodzik, 2000).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It has been proposed that Notch signaling also contributes (Baker and Yu, 1997; Li and Baker, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Ectopic Notch and Dpp together can initiate differentiation as effectively as ectopic Hh does (Baonza and Freeman, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	13	In this paper we sought to define the individual roles and interactions of each signal through the study of loss-of-function mutations affecting response to Hh, Dpp or N signals, both alone and in combination.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We also sought to determine the basis of the redundancy between Hh and Dpp, and how the two signals replace each other, and we investigated whether there is redundancy between Hh and N, and for what events, if any, each signal is individually sufficient in the absence of the others.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although redundant functions can be studied through ectopic expression experiments, a loss-of-function approach that removes components from the redundant pathways has the advantage of addressing gene function at the normal time and place, and at normal expression levels.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	16	 As each of Hh, Dpp and N signals are important many times during Drosophila development from embryogenesis onwards, it was necessary to use a conditional genetic approach.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We employed mosaic analysis using the FLP/FRT system to obtain clones of retinal cells lacking function of Hh, Dpp and N pathway components.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Each of these genes also plays roles in the initiation of the morphogenetic furrow at the posterior margin of the eye field, so that furrow initiation fails when eye margin cells are mutated, leaving the region to the anterior undifferentiated (Lee and Treisman, 2002).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The present study is therefore restricted to the progressive onset of differentiation by cells within the retinal field.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	20	Initially, we found that removing Smo did not prevent accumulation of the Ci activator Ci155.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, we found that differentiation of Smo-mutant cells depended not on Ci, but on Dpp and N signaling.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Perhaps because Dpp and Hh would otherwise act over different ranges, the pace of furrow progression is constrained by inhibitors, such as Hairy, which are themselves regulated by Dpp, Hh and N.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Taken together, these findings suggested that differentiation might depend on blocking production of Ci75 in response to Hh or Dpp.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	197	 One was that N signaling and Dpp signaling were each required for differentiation in the absence of ci.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The alternative was that N activity enhanced sensitivity to Dpp so that the limited Dpp signaling that occurs in Mad-mutant cells became sufficient for delayed differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	199	If N signaling was required for differentiation in the absence of ci, we would predict that Su(H) ci-mutant cells would be unable to differentiate.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, Su(H) ci-mutant cells did initiate differentiation, but such differentiation was delayed (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Thus N signaling was not absolutely required for differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Delayed differentiation in the absence of Su(H) and ci must depend on Dpp signaling, as it did not occur in Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Su(H) mutations must reduce the effectiveness of Dpp, as the timing of differentiation was normal in ci-mutant cells but delayed in Su(H) ci-mutant cells (differentiation in ci-mutant clones must be due to Dpp signaling, because tkv ci-mutant cells did not differentiate).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	204	 These results indicate that N signaling made Dpp signaling more effective, at least in the absence of Ci.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	212	Hh-dependent differentiation requiring Ci155 One model for the importance of Ci75 was that Ci75 antagonized Dpp and N function.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In this view the only normal role of Hh would be to help downregulate Ci75 at the furrow so that Dpp and N could act more promptly.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Delayed differentiation in smo clones would be due to ci75 antagonizing the Dpp/N function that we have found is sufficient for normal furrow progression in the absence of ci.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	217	 If the only role of Hh was to derepress Dpp and N signaling, then Mad Su(H)-mutant cells would not differentiate because of missing Dpp and N signals.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These results show that Dpp and N were dispensable for differentiation if Hh signaling was intact.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	222	 As Mad Su(H) ci cells did not differentiate, differentiation of Mad Su(H) depended on a positive role of Ci that was not mimicked by deleting the ci gene to remove Ci75.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Thus Hh, through Ci155, could drive differentiation in the absence of Dpp and N signaling.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Hh, Dpp and N signals do not appear essential to turn Hairy on, although Dpp does contribute because Hairy levels appear lower in clones mutant for tkv, Mad and their combinations with other mutations (Greenwood and Struhl, 1999) (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	229	One, or more, of Dpp, Hh or N signaling is required to turn Hairy off at the morphogenetic furrow, because Hairy expression was maintained cell autonomously in Mad Su(H) ci clones (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Hairy was turned off in Mad ci clones and tkv ci clones, although downregulation was delayed in the center of the clone (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This implies that N signaling is sufficient to downregulate Hairy in response to a signal from more posterior cells outside the clone.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	232	N signaling was required, and was sufficient, for Hairy downregulation, because Hairy was not shut off in Su(H) ci clones (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	233	 If N signaling was essential to shut off Hairy under all circumstances then we would expect Hairy expression to be maintained autonomously in Su(H) clones.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	234	 By contrast, there was only a brief delay to shutting off Hairy in Su(H) clones (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Hairy was also shut off in Mad Su(H) clones, although after a delay (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	236	 These results show that either N or Hh signals from posterior cells is sufficient to shut off Hairy expression, but that Hairy expression is maintained indefinitely in Mad Su(H) ci and Su(H) ci cells unable to respond to either pathway.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Downregulation of Hairy in response to Hh as well as N explains why N is not required for differentiation in response to Hh, even though it is required for differentiation in response to Dpp.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	238	Hairy retards differentiation Downregulating Hairy was neither necessary nor sufficient for differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Whereas Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells both failed to differentiate and maintained Hairy expression (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	240	 4E), tkv ci cells did not differentiate even though Hairy expression was shut off (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	241	 By contrast, Hairy expression was maintained in Su(H) ci-mutant clones, even though Su(H) ci cells could differentiate.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	242	 However, Hairy downregulation may contribute to prompt differentiation because differentiation is delayed in Su(H) ci compared with ci, and is less neurogenic in Su(H) ci than in Su(H) (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	243	As Hairy was shut off by either Hh or N signaling, Hairy maintenance away from the boundaries of Mad ci, tkv ci and Mad Su(H) clones shows that these genotypes were defective for Hh and Dl secretion.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Ci75 must repress Ato since mutation of smo imposes a delay on differentiation that is released by deleting ci.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Ci155 must activate Ato since Mad Su(H) cells differentiate but Mad Su(H) ci cells do not.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Tkv must activate Ato independently of Ci because ci cells differentiate normally but tkv ci and Mad ci cells do not.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Tkv is shown inhibiting Ci75, because Tkv promotes Ci155 accumulation in smo-mutant cells; this Ci155 is presumed to be inactive.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Tkv also promotes Ci155 accumulation in cells not mutant for smo.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Hairy has been shown previously to repress Ato function (Brown et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Ci155 must repress Hairy as Hairy is maintained cell autonomously by Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells but can be downregulated by Mad Su(H) cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	261	 N must repress Hairy as Hairy is maintained cell autonomously by Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells but can be downregulated by Mad ci cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	262	 N may activate Atonal independently of Hairy as well, because the furrow progresses faster through Su(H)-mutant clones where Hairy is still expressed (Li and Baker, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Hairy expression must be initiated in part by another signal, although Dpp has an input, as revealed by the quantitative reduction of Hairy levels in cells mutant for tkv (Greenwood and Struhl, 1999) and Mad, and all their combinations with Su(H) and ci.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The network accounts for all the mutant phenotypes.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In the absence of Ci, normal differentiation occurs in response to Dpp and N.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In the absence of smo, differentiation is delayed because activation pathways through Ci155 are lost but repression by Ci75 retained.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In the absence of both Dpp and N, differentiation occurs in response to Hh.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Absence of either tkv or N alone has little effect, reflecting either the dominant role of Hh, or perhaps that both positive and negative inputs are lost in each case.

0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Hh, Dl and Dpp are shown at the locations of their expression.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The signal acting most anteriorly to the morphogenetic furrow is Dpp.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Dpp is expressed at the anterior of the morphogenetic furrow in response to Hh.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	273	 More posteriorly, Dpp synergizes with the relatively indiffusible Dl signal to induce Atonal.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Dl is expressed in response to Atonal, and later in response to activation of Egfr by ligands produced by Atonal-dependent R8 cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Hh also induces Atonal through the Ci155/Ci75 ratio.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Hh is secreted by photoreceptor cells specified by Egfr activation by ligands produced by Atonal-dependent R8 cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Both N and Hh downregulate Hairy.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Despite intrinsically different ranges of Dpp and Hh signals, their activation of Ato coincides because Dpp also elevates Hairy, which must be downregulated by Hh or Dl.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	279	  The development of Mad Su(H) ci-mutant cells is a helpful starting point, as they may reflect a `ground state' of eye development that requires extracellular signals to differentiate.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Mad Su(H) ci cells fail to express the atonal or senseless genes that initiate R8 differentiation, and, consequently, fail to support retinal differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This shows that the absence of Ci75 is not sufficient for differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	282	 in Su(H) ci clones), but N and Dpp signaling together are required to activate Atonal with normal kinetics, as occurs in ci-mutant cells.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	283	 N signaling alone (in tkv ci clones) is insufficient.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In the presence of Ci, prompt differentiation required Hh to downregulate Ci75, and differentiation was delayed in Smo clones that lacked this input.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The normal role of Hh is not just to remove Ci75 thus permitting Dpp and N to work, because Atonal is turned on normally in Mad Su(H) clones that do not respond to Dpp or N signals.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Such differentiation depends exclusively on Hh yet progresses normally, except that a neurogenic phenotype reflects dependence of lateral inhibition on Su(H).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Hh depends positively on ci to drive differentiation in Mad Su(H) cells and, therefore, requires Ci155.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The positive role of ci can also be inferred from the delayed differentiation of Su(H) ci clones in comparison with Su(H) clones.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	289	We find that Hairy is downregulated redundantly by Hh and N signaling.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Prolonged Hairy expression is not sufficient to block differentiation completely but it does antagonize it (e.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Downregulation of Hairy in response to Hh as well as N explains why both ci and Su(H) mutant clones can differentiate promptly, and why N enhances differentiation in response to Dpp but is not required for differentiation in response to Hh.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	292	Hh or Dpp is sufficient for differentiation Comparison between Mad Su(H) ci cells that do not differentiate and Mad Su(H) cells that do shows that Hh signaling is sufficient to initiate eye differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This is consistent with previous studies of ectopic Hh activation (Heberlein and Moses, 1995; Li et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	294	, 1995; Ma and Moses, 1995; Pan and Rubin, 1995; Strutt et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Our experiments confirm this conclusion at the normal time and place of Hh signaling at the anterior of the morphogenetic furrow, and confirm directly that Dpp and N signaling are not necessary for Hh signaling to be sufficient.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	296	Comparison between Mad Su(H) ci cells and Su(H) ci cells shows that Dpp signaling is sufficient to initiate eye differentiation in its normal location in the absence of Hh or N signals, but such differentiation is delayed.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The normal timing of differentiation is restored by combined Dpp and N signals (in ci clones).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	298	 This is the basis for the ectopic differentiation on co-expression of Dpp and Dl ahead of the furrow (Baonza and Freeman, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	299	Superficially, our results differ from previous ectopic expression studies that concluded that Dpp signaling alone was not sufficient to induce ectopic differentiation in all locations (Pignoni and Zipursky, 1997; Greenwood and Struhl, 1999; Baonza and Freeman, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This discrepancy is probably explained by the baseline repressor activity of Su(H) protein (Hsieh and Hayward, 1995; Morel and Schweisguth, 2000).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Our previous work shows that without N signaling, repressor activity of Su(H) protein retards differentiation (Li and Baker, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Dpp signaling is sufficient for differentiation in our experiments where the Su(H) gene has been deleted.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	303	 In the presence of the Su(H) gene, Dpp may be most effective at locations where there is little Su(H) repressor activity, such as close to the morphogenetic furrow where N signaling is active.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	304	Comparison between Mad Su(H) ci cells, which do not differentiate, and Mad ci or tkv ci cells, which differentiate slowly or not at all, shows that Notch signaling alone is insufficient for differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Premature differentiation reported when N is activated ectopically ahead of the furrow must reflect endogenous Dpp signaling at such locations (Baonza and Freeman, 2001; Li and Baker, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	306	Mechanisms of redundancy Our experiments reveal an outline of the mechanisms of Hh, Dpp and N redundancy (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	307	 First, our results show that Mad and Ci independently reinforce differentiation, presumably through the transcription of target genes because Mad is sufficient for differentiation in the absence of Ci, and vice versa.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Our results show unequivocally that the transcriptional activator Ci155 activates differentiation in addition to Ci75 antagonizing differentiation.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	309	It was surprising to find that Dpp stabilizes Ci155 in the absence of Smo, which suggested Dpp input into Hh signal transduction.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Although the requirement for smo-dependent input through fused makes it unlikely that Ci155 is functional in smo clones (Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1997; Methot and Basler, 1999), Ci155 accumulation might be associated with reduced Ci75 levels.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Ci75 is shown to repress differentiation in smo clones because smo ci clones differentiation normally.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Ci155 stabilization cannot be due to an indirect effect of Dpp signaling on Hh, Ptc or Smo expression levels because the effect is detected in the absence of smo, and, therefore, reflects an effect on Hh signal transduction components downstream of Smo.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	313	 One idea is that Dpp signaling (or Dpp-induced differentiation) may replace SCFSlimb processing of Ci (which cleaves Ci155 to Ci75) with Cullin3-mediated Ci degradation, just as normally occurs posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (Ou et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In a smo clone, Ci155 would accumulate because Smo is required for Cullin3 to degrade Ci (Ou et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	315	 However, the SCFSlimb-to-Cullin3 switch may not be the only effect of Dpp on Ci processing, because Tkv slightly enhanced Ci155 accumulation even when smo is present (Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	316	Finally, downregulation of Hairy by N requires the Su(H) gene.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	317	 N also overcomes baseline repressor activity of Su(H) protein to promote progression of differentiation (Li and Baker, 2001).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	318	 This role of N must be independent of Hairy.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	319	Signal combinations control the rate of differentiation Dl, Hh and Dpp are generally thought to signal over very different distances.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	320	 How can signals of such different range substitute for one another to permit normal eye development? Fig.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	321	 5B shows signal sources and targets in the eye disc.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Dpp is transcribed in response to Hh signaling and is produced where Ci155 levels are highest (Heberlein et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	323	, 1993; Strutt and Mlodzik, 1996).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Dl is regulated by Hh indirectly through Ato and Ato-dependent Egfr activity in differentiating cells (Baker and Yu, 1998; Tsuda et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Hh is expressed most posteriorly of the three, in differentiating photoreceptors (Ma et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	326	Eye differentiation uses Hh to progress through cells unable to respond to Dpp (tkv, Mad) or N (Su(H)).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The range of Hh diffusion depends in part on the shape of the morphogenetic furrow cells (Benlali et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The Dpp that drives differentiation through ci-mutant cells unable to respond to Hh must diffuse from outside the ci clones because Dpp synthesis is Hh dependent (Heberlein et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	329	, 1993; Methot and Basler, 1999).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Large ci clones develop normally so Dpp diffusion cannot be limiting (dpp-mutant clones offer no information about the range of Dpp because they express and differentiate in response to Hh).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Instead the rate of progression in response to Dpp is controlled by Dl.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Dl signals over, at most, one or two cell diameters at the morphogenetic furrow (Baker and Yu, 1997).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	333	The previous view of eye patterning was influenced by the morphogen function of Hh and Dpp in other discs (Nellen et al.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	334	, 1996; Strigini and Cohen, 1997).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	335	 It was thought that domains of Ato and Hairy expression reflected increasing concentrations of Hh and Dpp (Greenwood and Struhl, 1999; Lee and Treisman, 2002).
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Our data shows that, in the eye, the combination of signals is important.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Differentiation is triggered where Dl and/or Hh synergize with Dpp, regardless of where the source of Dpp is.
0.14052135.12954721.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The additional requirements limit Dpp to initiating differentiation at the same locations that Hh does.

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, April 8, 2003.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	3	We previously established a line of PrP-deficient mice, designated Ngsk Prnp0/0, that exhibited late-onset ataxia because of cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration (4), which was rescued by the mouse wild-type PrP gene (Prnp) (5).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Subsequently, these results were reproduced in two independent lines, Rcm0 and Zrch II Prnp0/0 mice (6, 7).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In contrast, two other independent lines, Zrch I and Edbg Prnp0/0, have never revealed such a phenotype (8, 9).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Recent studies have provided evidence that the ectopic expression of a PrP-like protein/Doppel (PrPLP/Dpl) in the neuron of ataxic Prnp0/0 mouse lines but not non-ataxic lines could explain the discrepancy between phenotypes (6, 10).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Disruption of a part of the Prnp intron 2, including its splicing acceptor, in all the ataxic lines leads to unusual intergenic splicing between Prnp and the downstream gene, designated Prnd, encoding PrPLP/Dpl.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	8	 As a consequence, the PrPLP/Dpl gene comes under the control of the Prnp promoter, leading to the ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl in the neuron.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the physiological situation, PrPLP/Dpl mRNA is expressed at a high level in the testis and heart but is not detectable in the brain except for transient expression by brain endothelial cells around 1 week after birth (11).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A study using PrPLP/Dpl-deficient mice has suggested a physiological role for PrPLP/Dpl in spermatogenesis (12).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Recent reports demonstrated that introduction of a transgene encoding PrPLP/Dpl rendered Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice capable of reproducing the Purkinje cell degeneration observed in the Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice (13).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This is direct evidence confirming that both ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl and functional loss of PrP are required for the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	13	PrPLP/Dpl, a glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (14), consists of 179 amino acids with 23% identity to PrP in the primary structure but lacking the unique octapeptide-repeat region and hydrophobic region present in the N-terminal half of PrP (10).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	14	 An NMR study revealed similarities in the tertiary structure between PrPLP/Dpl and the C-terminal half of PrP, both of which are composed of two short -strands and three -helices (15).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Interestingly, expression of a transgene encoding truncated PrP lacking N-terminal residues 32 to 121 or 32 to 134 in nonataxic Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice also resulted in severe cerebellar degeneration, which was abrogated by reintroduction of the wild-type mouse PrP gene (16).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These results have suggested that PrPLP/Dpl and N-terminal-truncated (del32 to 121 or 32 to 134) PrP are toxic to neurons through similar mechanisms and that wild-type PrP may have a neuroprotective function.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	17	In the present study, to further elucidate mechanisms of the Purkinje cell death, we generated five different transgenic mouse lines expressing, respectively, heterologous, chimeric, and mutant PrPs on the Ngsk Prnp0/0 background.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A transgene encoding PrP-lacking N-terminal residues 23 to 88 failed to rescue the Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice from Purkinje cell degeneration, indicating a crucial role for the residues.

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In addition to the structural similarities between PrP and PrPLP/Dpl, the previous finding that a recombinant C-terminal PrP (121 to 231) fragment could convert into a -sheet-rich structure at acidic pH in vitro (26) prompted us to examine the involvement of abnormal PrPLP/Dpl aggregation in the neurodegeneration.

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The N-terminal region could thus be a key factor for determining whether physiological function is maintained but is likely to be less important in pathogenic structural conversion.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	136	Because the unique octapeptide-repeat region has the potential to bind copper (28), PrP may function in the transport or metabolism of copper in the neuron (29 to 31).

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It could thus be possible that impaired copper transport may result in reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to cell death.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Indeed, the reduced activity of Cu/Zn-SOD in the brains of Zrch I Prnp0/0 mice has been reported (33).

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Hence, copper could be one candidate for this hypothetical ligand, acting to raise a neurotoxic signal or prevent a survival signal through binding to PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This indicated that loss of the N-terminal residues 23 to 88 did not affect the cleavage, and C1 was not necessary for the phenotype rescue.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	157	 It has also been shown that a N-terminal cleavage product, PrP-(23 to 110/111), designated N1, was released into the supernatant of cultured cells (40).

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	159	 For instance, it may bind to copper or other molecules to produce a neuroprotective signal.

0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	162	Another model for the neurodegeneration to be evaluated is that the absence of PrP might make cerebellar cells vulnerable to a constitutive weak apoptotic signal transduced by PrPLP/Dpl (36).
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	163	 PrP could raise an anti-apoptotic signal independently and protect from the PrPLP/Dpl-induced apoptosis.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Accumulating evidence has supported an anti-apoptotic role of PrP.
0.15615378.12759361.html.plaintext.txt	165	 For instance, overexpression of PrP protected human primary neurons from Bax-mediated apoptosis (41).

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	8	The host PrP gene (Prnp) has a major influence over the outcome of TSE disease.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	9	 PrP polymorphisms have been shown to alter incubation time and TSE susceptibility in mice (Moore et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Classical genetic analysis of the control of TSE incubation time in mice identified the presence of a single gene (Sinc) encoding two alleles (s7 and p7), which programmed short and long incubation times, respectively, for the ME7 strain of scrapie (Dickinson et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Similar differences in incubation time have been found between NZW/LacJ and Iln/J mouse strains when infected with the Chandler isolate, identifying a single locus, Prni, that controlled incubation time, which was linked closely to Prnp (Carlson et al.

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, due to the different genetic backgrounds of these lines of inbred mice, it was difficult to confirm that the Prnp, Sinc and Prni genes were congruent and that the polymorphisms in Prnp were responsible for the control of scrapie incubation time in mice.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	15	The introduction of 108F and 189T into the murine Prnpa gene by gene targeting produced a line of transgenic mice (FV/FV) that differed from the 129/Ola parental line by only the targeted polymorphisms.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Inoculation of these mice with TSE infectivity produced incubation times similar to those in Prnpb mice, demonstrating that Sinc, Prni and Prnp were indeed the same gene and that the codon 108 and/or 189 polymorphisms were the major factors controlling TSE incubation time in mice (Moore et al.

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	110	  In order to assess the full effect of the polymorphisms in both the homozygous and heterozygous situations, LV/LV and FT/FT mice were crossed with wild-type LT/LT mice, gene-targeted FV/FV mice and each other to produce the full repertoire of genetic combinations (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This breeding strategy produced 10 lines of transgenic mice, each with a different PrP allelic combination.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Each line of mice was inoculated intracerebrally with ME7 and the resulting incubation times are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	113	Introducing heterozygosity at codons 108 and 189 revealed that the control of incubation time by these two polymorphisms is not as straightforward as suggested by data from the homozygous lines (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	114	 There is no obvious pattern of allelic combination associated with increasing incubation time (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online), with the exception that the two shortest incubation times are in mice that are homozygous for 189T (155 and 168 days) and the two longest are in mice that are homozygous for 189V (295 and 325 days), in keeping with identity at codon 189 with the source of the agent (LT/LT).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However, homozygosity at codon 189 does not always produce extreme incubation times, as LT/FT and LV/LV mice have intermediate incubation times of 196 and 261 days, respectively (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	116	An association between genotype and incubation time can be identified when the 10 lines are examined by the allelic combinations at either codon 108 or codon 189 (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	117	 When lines are sorted into groups by codon 189 genotype (189TT, 189VV or 189FV), the effect of codon 108 on incubation time is the same in each of the three groups: the shortest incubation times occur when the codon at 108 is homozygous for either L or F, although the shorter of the two is always 108LL, matching that of the source of the inoculum (LT/LT).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Therefore, at codon 108, heterozygosity always leads to increased incubation times with respect to the combination at codon 189, despite the inoculum matching one allele at codon 108.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Indeed, incubation times in excess of those in Prnpb (FV/FV) mice were observed in FV/LV mice [Table 1 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)].
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, when sorted by codon 108 genotype (108LL, 108FF or 108LF), a different pattern of incubation time is observed.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	121	 For each of the three groups, homozygosity for threonine at codon 189 (which matches the source of the inoculum) gives the shortest incubation times and homozygosity for valine (which does not match the inoculum) gives the longest incubation times, whilst the heterozygotes (TV) produce intermediate incubation times.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Hence, at codon 108, ME7 incubation times follow the pattern LL < FF < LF, whilst at codon 189, the pattern of incubation time is TT < TV < VV.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	123	 These results show that the effect on incubation period depends upon the combination of PrP alleles, particularly the presence of homozygosity or heterozygosity at codons 108 and 189 and on identity with the source of the inoculum at these positions in PrP.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	124	Interactions between codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms and the 301V strain In contrast to ME7 challenge, LT/LT mice inoculated with the Prnpb (FV/FV)-passaged strain 301V have long incubation periods of 240 days.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Similarly, FV/FV mice that have long ME7 incubation periods produce short incubation periods of 125 days with 301V.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The role of codons 108 and 189 in the control of 301V incubation time was explored by challenge of FT/FT and LV/LV mice.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Incubation times of 141 and 202 days were obtained in the LV/LV and FT/FT lines of mice, respectively, compared to 125 days in FV/FV mice and 240 days in LT/LT mice (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Hence, in agreement with the data obtained from inoculations with ME7, both codons 108 and 189 are responsible for the control of incubation time for the 301V agent strain.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Similarly to ME7, the greatest effect was produced by the T to V alteration at codon 189 (100 days reduction).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However the L to F change produced a greater effect on incubation time with 301V (60 days reduction) than with ME7, again showing that challenge with an agent that shows identity at codon 108 or 189 results in the shortest incubation times (Table 1).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The full range of allelic combinations has not been examined with this strain of TSE agent.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In addition, no incubation time is available for the LT/FT line.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Six LT/FT mice were culled due to welfare reasons between 327 and 377 days and all showed positive TSE pathology on examination of the brain tissue, suggesting an incubation time in excess of that of the LT/LT line (240 days).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the combinations that were examined have produced patterns of incubation-time alteration identical to those identified with ME7 [Table 1 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)], with the exception that the F1 cross LT/FV has an incubation time in excess of those of both parental lines.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This overdominance is characteristic of 301V and can be observed with other TSE strains.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Thus, the pattern of incubation time for 301V appears to be FF < LL < LF at codon 108 and VV < TV < TT at codon 189.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This pattern is the same as that observed for ME7, where heterozygosity results in extended incubation times for 108LF, but intermediate incubation times with 189TV.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The shortest incubation times for both strains of agent reveal a preference for identity with the genotype of the donor of infectivity (LT/LT for ME7 and FV/FV for 301V).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	139	Effect of polymorphisms on PrPSc production Detergent homogenates were prepared from three terminal ME7 brains of each genotype.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The homogenates were treated with PK and analysed by immunoblotting to assess the levels of PK-resistant PrP present in each model.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Equal levels of PK-resistant PrP were detected between the three mice of each genotype (data not shown).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Levels were also similar between the 10 different lines of mice (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	143	 4), suggesting that the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms have no effect on PrPSc levels in the brains of mice culled with clinical ME7 infection.

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	152	  Effect of polymorphisms on vacuolar pathology The targeting of vacuolar pathology in the brain was similar for all allelic combinations infected with ME7 (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Thus, the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in host PrP do not influence the distribution of vacuolar pathology with the ME7 strain of scrapie.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, the polymorphisms appeared to affect the degree of vacuolation.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In general, lines containing 189TT (LT/LT, FT/FT and LT/FT) or 189TV with homozygosity at 108 (LT/LV and FT/FV) had short incubation times ( < 215 days) and gave very similar vacuolation profiles.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Lines displaying higher vacuolation scores had longer incubation times and contained 189VV (FV/FV, LV/LV or FV/LV) or were heterozygous at both 108 and 189 (LV/FT).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, the LT/FV heterozygote gave a vacuolation profile more similar to that in LT/LT mice (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Alternatively, these observations may simply reflect incubation time of disease, with high degrees of vacuolation being associated with extended incubation times.

0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	166	  The effect of the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms on targeting was more prominent in 301V-infected lines, where the targeting of vacuolation varied between LT/LT and FV/FV mice (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	167	 189VV mice (LV/LV) and 189TV mice homozygous at codon 108 (LV/LT) gave profiles similar to those of FV/FV mice, whilst 189TT mice (FT/FT and LT/FT) gave profiles similar to those of LT/LT mice (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The LT/FV heterozygote produced an intermediate vacuolation profile (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The degree of vacuolation with 301V therefore does appear to be controlled by the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms and not by incubation time, as extended incubation times in FT/FT and LT/FT mice resulted in lower vacuolation scores in areas 7 to 9 compared to FV/FV mice (Fig.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	170	The control of incubation time is thought to be due to PrP sequence identity between the host and the donor of infectivity.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, our results show that short incubation times are obtained in FT/FT mice inoculated with LT/LT-derived ME7 and in LV/LV mice inoculated with FV/FV-derived 301V, despite the sequence incompatibility between donor and host at codon 108.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Hence, although codon 108 polymorphisms can affect scrapie incubation time independently, the major control is due to identity with the source of inoculum at codon 189.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The inoculation of mice expressing different combinations of PrnpLT, PrnpFV, PrnpLV and PrnpFT produced a complex series of incubation times (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It was clear that, in addition to identity with the inoculum at codon 189, homozygosity at codon 108 consistently gave rise to shorter incubation times in both 108L/L- and 108F/F-expressing lines.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Heterozygosity at codon 108 always resulted in extended incubation times with respect to the genotype at codon 189.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Although the series of allelic crosses produced for these experiments are described as homozygous and heterozygous at codons 108 and 189, expression from both Prnp alleles in a heterozygote will result in the presence of two different PrP populations in the cell.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It is interactions between these proteins, and not between Prnp alleles, that will determine the incubation time of disease.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Hence, the nature or combination of PrP variants in the recipient may be more important than PrP identity with the inoculum, indicating that interactions between amino acids 108 and 189, either on the same or different proteins, is a critical part of disease propagation.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	179	It has been proposed that the production of PrPSc is a two-step process that involves binding of PrP-res (PK-resistant PrP) to PrP-sen (PK-sensitive PrP), followed by the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res (Caughey, 2001).
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, it is unknown which process requires PrP amino acid identity.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Cell-free conversion experiments have shown that mouse PrP-res (108L_111V) will convert mouse PrP-sen expressing the 3F4 epitope (108M_111M), but not hamster PrP-sen (also possessing the 3F4 epitope), even though both proteins were found to bind to mouse PrP-res (Horiuchi et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Deletion mutants lacking residues 34 to 113 (MoPrP34 to 113) also bound to mouse PrP-res and converted, albeit with reduced efficiency (Lawson et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results imply that amino acid 108 is not required for either initiation of conversion or binding to PrPSc, but may be involved in the control of the rate of conversion and final conformation of PrP-res (Lawson et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Moreover, MoPrP34 to 113 was found to bind heterologous PrPSc, but, unlike the full-length molecule, did not prevent the conversion of homologous PrPC, again suggesting that this region is involved in the control of conversion, but not binding (Lawson et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The 34 to 113 truncation of PrPC was also found to affect the solubility of the molecule, as loss of these residues reduced the percentage of PrP-sen that was seen to self-aggregate when incubated under cell-free assay conditions in the absence of PrP-res.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This region may therefore be responsible for some degree of multimerization/aggregation of PrP-sen, which may be beneficial for conversion (Lawson et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	187	The individual effects of codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in PrP have also been modelled in vitro by expressing recombinant 108F_189T and 108L_189V PrP in Escherichia coli (Brown et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These intermediate forms of PrP were found to be less stable than both PrP-A (108L_189T) and PrP-B (108F_189V) and were observed to lose their normal conformation and gain some PK resistance over time.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It was proposed that inheritance of either 108F or 189V alone may be a disadvantage in terms of mouse survival, and that mice expressing either of these polymorphisms separately could potentially develop spontaneous disease (Brown et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	190	 However, the recently reported existence of a Prnpc (108F_189T)-expressing line (Lloyd et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	191	, 2004) and the data presented here for transgenic FT/FT and LV/LV lines show that such mice are viable and do not develop any neurological phenotype during their lifespan.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	192	 PrP expressed in the brains of transgenic LT/LT and FV/FV mice is PK-sensitive and expressed at levels identical to those in wild-type mice of both genotypes.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These results demonstrate clearly that in vitro and in vivo studies can produce very different outcomes; these may be due to the difference in PrP post-translational modification and/or the physiological environment of the native protein.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	194	From the data presented here, we predict that: (i) polymorphisms at PrP codon 189 control the initial interaction and binding with the agent, as incubation times reflect a preference for sequence identity between the host and inoculum at codon 189; and (ii) polymorphisms at codon 108 control the rate of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, where the ability to induce multimerization of PrPC and increase the efficiency of conversion is favoured when all PrP expressed in a cell is homogeneous in the N-terminal region.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Alternatively, the preference for codon 108 homozygosity may reflect a more complex interaction between host PrPC and PrPSc that is less efficient in the presence of heterogeneous protein populations.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	196	 However, the importance of codon 108 homozygosity in murine scrapie transmission may explain the role of PrP codon 129 in human TSE disease, where the majority of CJD cases occur in individuals who are homozygous for methionine or valine at codon 129 (Palmer et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	197	 There is an under-representation of M/V heterozygotes with CJD when compared to the distribution of genotypes in the normal population (Palmer et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	198	, 1991), suggesting that a similar mechanism requiring N-terminal homogeneity controls the efficiency of disease transmission in humans.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	199	The results of transmissions to the 108L/F_189T/V lines of transgenic mice have therefore shown that codon 189 polymorphisms exert the major control over scrapie incubation time, but that the efficiency of disease transmission is increased when codon 108 is homozygous, suggesting that a multimer of PrPC may be involved in conversion of PrP during TSE disease.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Several other studies have suggested the involvement of PrP dimers in disease (Priola et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	201	, 1995; Warwicker, 1997, 2000; Meyer et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	202	, 2003), yet most existing dimer models do not consider dimerization of the N-terminal region of PrP, due to the lack of structural information available for this region.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Combined with the in vivo data produced in this study, the observations that amino acids 90 to 121 are retained after PK cleavage of PrPSc and that deletion of this region affects susceptibility to disease (Fischer et al.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	204	, 2001) prove that this is a structurally important part of the molecule that is involved in the control of disease incubation time.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	205	Analysis of LV/LV and FT/FT transgenic mice has therefore shown that amino acid polymorphisms at both codons 108 and 189 in murine PrP are involved in the control of scrapie incubation time, and that distinct regions of PrP may play different roles in the disease process.
0.16557215.15722549.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Interactions within a single PrP molecule and between molecules must therefore underlie the mechanism by which incubation times are controlled.

0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The removal of PrP-sen could displace the equilibrium to the degradation processes.
0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	115	 An obvious limitation is that although PrP-res levels were dramatically decreased by acute siRNA exposure, the cells were not definitively `cured' of scrapie infection; thus, chronic treatments or longer exposures of siRNA may be considered in the future.
0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	116	 We are currently performing experiments to improve the long-term effects of siRNA duplexes.

0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Thus, siRNA technology should provide insights into the understanding of the physiological functions of PrP in somatic cultured cells.

0.16906957.12759373.html.plaintext.txt	125	Our results show that the siRNA technique should be useful for dissecting basic mechanisms of prion pathogenesis, in addition to its obvious potential as a therapeutic agent.

0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Genetics, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	2	The mammalian spongiform encephalopathies gave rise to the concept of infectious proteins, proteins that can transmit an infection without an essential nucleic acid.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	3	 This concept is now identified with the term "prion.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	4	" These diseases, including scrapie of sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (and its variants), are believed to be the result of a self-propagating change of PrP, a cell surface protein.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The minireview in this issue by Charles Weissmann (1) examines the spongiform encephalopathies and summarizes work from a number of laboratories.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	6	In 1994, it was suggested that two non-chromosomal genetic elements of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, [URE3] and [PSI], were infectious protein (prion) forms of Ure2p and Sup35p.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These findings have been particularly exciting because these systems will permit the application of the powerful genetic methods available in yeast to the study of the prion problem.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recently, [Het-s], a non-Mendelian genetic element of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina has been identified as another likely prion.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In each case, the evidence points to an altered form of a chromosomally encoded protein that has acquired the ability to convert the normal form of the protein into the same altered (prion) abnormal form.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These new developments will be summarized in a second minireview by Reed Wickner et al.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	11	 (2), focused on the evidence that prions of yeast and fungi can serve as genetic material, and a third by Susan Liebman and Irina Derkatch (3) discussing the yeast [PSI+] prion in detail, including its interactions with chaperones and other proteins.
0.17309903.9867801.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Although the epidemic of "mad cow disease" has brought this field to the headlines, its scientific excitement rests more on the notion that altered protein conformations can impart disease and the somewhat revolutionary concepts of infection and heredity that have come out of this work.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	5	The influence of other amino acid substitutions in the murine Prnp gene on the incubation time of disease has been demonstrated previously.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The substitution of leucine for proline at amino acid 101 (101L) in the murine Prnpa allele by gene targeting (Prnpa101L) has been shown to shorten TSE incubation times with P102L GSS from humans, 263K from hamsters and SSBP/1 from sheep when compared with wild-type (101P) mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Conversely, a second human TSE agent, variant CJD (vCJD), displayed prolonged incubation times in Prnpa101L (101LL) mice when compared with wild-type mice (Barron et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, when challenged with the mouse-passaged scrapie strains ME7 (derived from mice carrying the Prnpa gene) and 22A (derived from mice carrying the Prnpb gene), the 101LL mice also displayed increased incubation times when compared with mice homozygous for either Prnpa or Prnpb alleles (Barron et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Transgenic mice overexpressing murine PrP containing a methionine substitution at position 108 have also been shown to produce a lengthening in scrapie incubation time compared with mice overexpressing the wild-type gene; however, the effect of mutation and transgene copy number cannot readily be separated in these experiments (Supattapone et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	10	The mechanism by which these polymorphisms and mutations in murine PrP control incubation time has not yet been established.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Amino acids 101 and 108 are located in the N-terminal region of PrP (amino acids 21 to 121), which has been described in NMR structural studies as having no discernible secondary structure (Donne et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, despite the apparent lack of structure, this region of PrP contains the octapeptide repeat sequences which have been shown to bind copper, and therefore may influence both the structure and the function of the normal protein (Brown et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	13	, 1997; Brown  and  Harris, 2002).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Deletion studies have shown also that removing sections of the N-terminal region can cause increased incubation times and reduced efficiency of disease propagation in mice (Flechsig et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 2001), and can reduce efficiency of PrPC conversion in cell-free conversion assays (Lawson et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Due to the close proximity of amino acids 101 and 108, it is possible that similar mechanisms are operating by which changes at these positions in murine PrP control scrapie incubation time in mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In order to further investigate the role of this region of PrP in influencing TSE disease transmission, we have inoculated 101LL mice with four mouse-passaged TSE strains derived from both Prnpa and Prnpb mice, and compared the disease profile of 101LL mice with that of Prnpa and Prnpb mice of the same genetic background.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	53	 This observation was similar to that obtained previously with ME7 (Manson et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In order to assess whether this mechanism of control on incubation time could be similar to that of the 108F/189V polymorphisms, we compared the incubation times of these agents in Prnpa(108F/189V) mice, which are the same genetic background as 101LL mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The results showed that 79A and 139A incubation times were increased in both 101LL and Prnpa(108F/189V) mice when compared with Prnpa mice (Table 1, Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, the degree to which incubation times were extended varied with the strain of agent.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	57	 With the 79A strain of agent the 108F/189V alterations lead to a more prolonged incubation time than the 101L mutation, whereas the opposite was true for the 139A strain.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This suggested that the interaction with each strain of agent and control of incubation time differs with 108F/189V and 101L.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	59	For the strains derived from mice homozygous for the Prnpb allele the situation was more complex.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Incubation times of 79V are reduced in Prnpa mice (234 days) compared with the expected homologous transmission in VM (Prnpb) mice of 270 days (Bruce, 1993) (data not available from transmission of 79V to Prnpa(108F/189V) mice).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	61	 However, the incubation time in 101LL mice was found to be extended by over 100 days with respect to both Prnpa and Prnpb genotypes (377 days).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	62	 With 301V, incubation times in both Prnpa and 101LL mice were extended with respect to Prnpa(108F/189V) mice, but the degree to which the incubation times were increased was greater in Prnpa than in 101LL mice (70 day difference).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	63	 These results also differed from those obtained previously with 22A (also Prnpb derived) in which incubation times of Prnpa and 101LL mice were increased by approximately the same degree compared with Prnpa(108F/189V) mice (Table 1, Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, in transmissions of Prnpb strains of agent to 101LL mice, the observed effects are due to three amino acid changes in host PrP (108, 189 and 101).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To truly examine the effect of the 101L mutation on Prnpb-derived strains of agent would require the mutation to be expressed on this allele, as the possibility of combinatory or compensatory mechanisms of the 101L and 108L alterations cannot be ignored during infection with Prnpb strains (Vorberg et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, the effect of Prnpb strains in Prnpa and 101LL mice (which differ by only one amino acid) was unpredictable.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	67	 While the 79V strain showed a further lengthening of the Prnpa incubation time in the presence of the 101L mutation, a reduction in the Prnpa incubation time was observed in 101LL mice inoculated with the 301V strain.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These results, particularly those produced with the 301V strain, again indicate that the control of incubation time by the 101L mutation is different from that of the 108/189 polymorphisms.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	70	101L mutation can affect PrPSc production It had been observed previously that brain tissue from 101LL mice infected with ME7 contained lower levels of protease-resistant PrP at the terminal stage of disease than wild-type mice (Manson et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	71	 To determine whether the 101L mutation in the host PrP gene influenced the level of protease-resistant PrP produced by other strains of mouse scrapie, brain homogenates were prepared from 101LL and wild-type Prnpa mice infected with the Prnpa strains 139A and 79A, and the Prnpb strains 22A, 79V and 301V, and analysed by Western blotting with mAbs 7A12 and 8H4.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Preliminary analysis focused on three mice of each genotype with each strain of agent, to assess whether levels of PrPSc in the brain were consistent, or varied between animals.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	73	 For all transmissions, similar levels of PrPSc were observed between three mice in each group, except for the transmission of 22A to 101LL mice (data not shown).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Comparison of 101LL and Prnpa mice inoculated with Prnpa strains showed that heterologous transmissions to 101LL mice produced levels of PrPSc identical to those seen in the homologous transmission to Prnpa mice, despite the difference in incubation times (Table 1 and Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Similarly, transmission of 79V and 301V produced the same PrPSc levels in 101LL and Prnpa mice despite heterologous transmission in the presence of three and two PrP amino acid differences respectively.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The difference seen between 101LL and Prnpa mice with 79V on this blot appears, on examination of the lanes without proteinase K treatment, to be due to protein loadings (Fig.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, the heterologous challenge of 101LL mice with Prnpb strain 22A did show some degree of variation in the level of PrPSc present.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Of three animals examined, one showed similar levels to those found on inoculation of Prnpa mice, but the others contained much lower levels (Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The presence of the 101L mutation therefore does not affect the level of PrPSc produced by some strains of agent, but can alter PrPSc levels with other strains independent of the Prnp genotype of the source of infectivity, as found here with 22A and previously with ME7 (Manson et al.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The degree of vacuolation in specific brain areas is characteristic of individual mouse-passaged scrapie strains.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Vacuolation is scored on a scale of 0 to 5 in nine grey matter and three white matter areas, and average scores ( plus or minus SEM) plotted to give a lesion profile, which is essentially a fingerprint for each strain (Fraser  and  Dickinson, 1967).
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Lesion profiles were produced for each strain of mouse scrapie, comparing mean vacuolation scores from 101LL and Prnpa mice displaying both clinical and pathological signs of TSE disease (Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The heterologous transmission to 101LL mice of Prnpa-derived strains 139A and 79A produced significant variation in the targeting of vacuolation when compared with the corresponding homologous transmission in Prnpa mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The 139A and 79A Prnpa-derived mouse scrapie strains share a common lineage, and produce identical lesion profiles in wild-type mice of both Prnp genotypes.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	95	 These strains can, however, be distinguished by their incubation times in Prnpb (or Prnpa(108F/189V)) mice (Table 1, Fig.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Both of these strains displayed increased levels of vacuolation in areas 1 (dorsal medulla), 3 (superior colliculus), 4 (hypothalamus) and 7 (septum), but decreased levels of vacuolation in the white matter regions (1* cerebellar white matter, 2* midbrain white matter, 3* cerebral peduncle) of 101LL mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The change in vacuolar profile and incubation time of these two related strains in 101LL mice appears identical (Figs 1, 3; Table 1), indicating a similar interaction between each strain and the 101L mutation in PrP.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Heterologous challenges with Prnpb-derived strains (79V, 22A and 301V) produced less variability between Prnpa and 101LL mice, despite differing from the source of infectivity by two and three PrP amino acids respectively.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Identical lesion profiles were obtained in 101LL and Prnpa mice challenged with 301V, and although 79V showed reduced levels of vacuolation in areas 6 to 9 (hippocampus, septum, cerebral cortex and forebrain cerebral cortex) of the 101LL brain, the overall pattern was the same as in Prnpa mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The 22A strain showed slightly more variability due to altered levels of vacuolation in areas 4 (hypothalamus), 7 (septum) and 8 (cerebral cortex), but all other areas of grey and white matter showed identical targeting of vacuolation in both lines of mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The 101L mutation therefore exerts a strain-specific effect on vacuolar targeting ranging from little or no alteration with heterologous challenges differing at three amino acids (108L, 189T and 101L), to major alterations with heterologous challenges differing at only one amino acid (101L), which was also observed previously with ME7 (Manson et al.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The differences in PrP sequence between species are thought to reduce the efficiency of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, and result in low transmission frequencies and long incubation periods.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, TSE infectivity from human, hamster and sheep brain tissue has previously been transmitted to 101LL mice with reduced incubation times compared with wild-type mice, despite the lack of PrP sequence identity between species (Barron et al.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The PrP sequence of C57BL mice (Prnpa) in which ME7, 139A and 79A are propagated differs from that of 101LL mice by only one amino acid (101P), yet incubation times in 101LL mice are 2-fold greater than in wild-type mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The PrP sequence of VM mice (Prnpb) in which 79V, 301V and 22A are propagated differs from 101LL mice at three residues (101P, 108F and 189V); however, the effect is in this case far less predictable.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	112	 With Prnpb-derived strains, incubation times observed in 101LL mice were also extended when compared with Prnpb mice, but were found to be both shorter (301V) and longer (79V and 22A) when compared with the Prnpa mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus within the mouse species the presence of the 101L alteration prolongs the scrapie incubation time normally observed in the donor genotype.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	114	 However for agents from other species, the effect of the 101L mutation appears in most cases to be to facilitate the transmission of disease, perhaps indicating that the 101L mutation allows more efficient adaptation of an agent in mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	115	The effect of the 101L mutation on murine scrapie incubation times largely parallels the effect of the 108/189 polymorphisms in murine PrP, as incubation times are extended in 101LL mice compared with the homologous transmission in either Prnpa or Prnpb mice.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	116	 However, the degree to which incubation times are affected by 101L is distinct from 108/189, and is also very unpredictable with Prnpb-derived strains.

0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Although the precise effects of the 108M/111M mutations are difficult to quantify in these experiments due to the differences in Prnp gene copy number and genetic background between control and mutant mice, the results suggested that mutations in this region of PrP may extend TSE incubation times with all mouse-passaged TSE isolates.
0.18022668.14573822.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, in this experiment incubation times with 301V were extended in Prnpa(108M/111M) mice compared with the transgenic mice overexpressing Prnpa.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In spite of the small sample size, the 95 % CI showed a decrease in the odds ratio for deer with the QSAS allele and lacking the QGAS allele when compared with deer with the presumed wild-type QGAS homozygous genotype.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Homozygous QSAS deer had a lower odds ratio (0 089, 95 % CI 0 016 to 0 502) than did heterozygous QSAS QGGS deer (0 167, CI 0 035 to 0 789).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The presence of the QGAS allele resulted in similar odds ratios for heterozygous QSAS (0 564, 95 % CI 0 212 to 1 501) or QGGS (0 444, 95 % CI 0 133 to 1 489) deer.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The H/Q polymorphism at position 95 results in substitution of a neutral for a polar residue but is commonly reported in the deduced amino acid sequences from the PRNP gene among and within a large number of species (Schatzl et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Residue 96, encoding G or S, is adjacent to the final octapeptide repeat in a region poorly conserved among the mammalian species examined, with insertions and single base changes reported (Van Rheede et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Although there was no evidence for resistance to disease in deer with any of the major genotypes in this study, deer lacking the QGAS allele and carrying one or two copies of the allele encoding 96S (QSAS) were less likely to be found in the CWD population than deer with the QGAS allele on one or both chromosomes.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This finding is consistent with data from deer in Wisconsin (Johnson et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	99	, 2003), although in that study universal prion primers were used and the functional genotype could not be determined for some animals from the data shown.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The sample sizes in both studies are relatively small (26 in Wisconsin, 67 in this study).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	101	 If larger sample sizes support these observations, however, the pattern of genetic susceptibility in white-tailed deer would be similar to that observed in Rocky Mountain elk, in which a predisposing genotype is reported (O'Rourke et al.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The low frequency and lack of heterogeneity of the white-tailed deer pseudogene could be due to inbreeding within this confined herd, to polymorphisms in the primer binding sites resulting in detection of a limited subset of alleles or to a relatively recent introduction of the pseudogene into the genome of white-tailed deer.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Although the founder group in the study herd was estimated at fewer than 20 animals, loss of heterogeneity in the pseudogene due to inbreeding is an unlikely explanation because all functional alleles identified in the Wisconsin (Johnson et al.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Furthermore, using the 138N polymorphism as a marker for PNRP in the Wisconsin and Wyoming studies, pseudogene frequencies are similar among the groups.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Polymorphisms in the PCR primer-binding sites cannot be ruled out.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, the pseudogene was detected with two primer pairs in all deer in which the 138N mutation was detected with the universal prion primer pair, suggesting that failure to amplify a novel PRNP allele is not likely.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Although the evolution and taxonomy of the dozens of subspecies of white-tailed and black-tailed deer in the Americas are complex, examination of mitochondrial DNA and Y-linked genes supports the model that white-tailed deer and black-tailed deer diverged on the North American continent during the Pleistocene, with subsequent hybridization of sympatric populations resulting in appearance of mule deer (reviewed by Geist  and  Francis, 1999).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Subsequent hybridization between mule deer and white-tailed deer probably occurred (and continues to occur) infrequently, with a low level of introgressive hybridization of maternal DNA from mule deer and black-tailed deer into white-tailed deer populations within limited geographic areas (Cronin, 1991).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	129	The PRNP alleles in this study and the previous study of mule deer (Brayton et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	130	, 2004) invariably encoded 138N and an expansion of the octapeptide repeat number was observed in some deer.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	131	 These changes were not seen in the functional gene, leaving unresolved the question of whether the changes occurred in the ancestral functional gene before the duplication event or in the processed pseudogene after duplication.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The substitution of N for S in the prion protein is common within and among species and functional alleles encoding 138N are common in fallow deer (Dama dama) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (unpublished data).

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	137	 If PRNP arose after evolutionary radiation of Odocoileus species in the New World, this pseudogene is not likely to be found in more distantly related members of the order Artiodactyla such as sheep, cattle or goats.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Novel pseudogenes may yet be found in some populations of domestic livestock through judicious selection of primer pairs optimized for pseudogene discovery.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, processed pseudogenes are not typically transcribed or translated (Mighell et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	140	, 2000) and are therefore not expected to affect susceptibility to a protein-based disorder.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	141	All major PRNP diploid genotypes were represented in the CWD group in this study.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	142	 We addressed the possibility of genetically controlled differences in incubation time (the period from infection until accumulation of detectable PrPd in the brain) by examining fawns (animals under 1 year of age) for late disease (PrPd in the brain).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Using this crude measure, we identified three fawns (QGAS QSAS and QGAS QGGS genotypes) with late disease, demonstrating an extremely rapid course in those animals.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	144	 PrPd is thought to accumulate first in the lymphoid tissues of the alimentary tract (Sigurdson et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	145	, 1999), with subsequent neuroinvasion and transport through the splenic or vagus nerves to the brain.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In experimental rodent models, the incubation time and neuroinvasion rate are associated with a number of variables, including PRNP polymorphisms (Dickinson  and  Outram, 1973), innervation and PrPc production in lymphoid tissues (Mabbott et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	147	, 2001), and route of infection (Bartz et al.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Transgenic mice with cervid PRNP genes may be an appropriate laboratory model for examining the extremely rapid neuroinvasion seen in some genotypes.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In spite of an infection rate of nearly 50 % in this herd, no clinical evidence of CWD was noted in live deer by the property owner or hunters or at necropsy.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Losses to intercurrent viral diseases were extensive during some years and the terrain provided adequate cover for sick animals to evade detection prior to death, possibly masking the presence of a TSE in this herd.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Alternately, the clinical course in these white-tailed deer may have been more acute than described in mule deer due to differences in the biology of the cervid host, the strain of TSE agent in this herd or the dose of the disease-causing agent in this confined facility.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Additional observations on clinical CWD in white-tailed deer held in captive settings will be necessary to address the spectrum of phenotypes of TSE infection in cervids.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	155	PRNP alleles and diploid genotypes of white-tailed deer with CWD identify those associated with CWD susceptibility.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In contrast, disease resistance is considerably more challenging to define in free-ranging populations for several reasons.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	157	 First, equivalent exposure to the disease-causing agent cannot be demonstrated across the population.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Although the deer in this study were removed from a single fenced area, it is likely that the herd spent part of the year in small maternally related groups, congregating at feed plots and at natural watering areas.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	159	 CWD transmission routes are not known and the relative efficiency of transmission through deer-to-deer contact or through shared feed and water sources cannot be determined.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Microsatellite analysis of DNA from the affected animals needs to be performed to determine whether maternal contact increases the probability of infection.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Secondly, some of the alleles are relatively rare and additional study populations from the endemic areas or from selectively bred captive white-tailed deer will be needed to increase the sample size in these genotypes.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Thirdly, the interval from infection to the accumulation of detectable PrPd levels is not known.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	163	 CWD was diagnosed in deer at 8 to 10 months of age in this herd, establishing a minimum incubation period.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The maximum incubation period cannot be identified if infection times occur outside the perinatal period (Miller  and  Williams, 2003).
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Some older adult deer had detectable PrPd restricted to the lymphoid tissue.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	166	 If the temporal pattern of PrPd accumulation in white-tailed deer is similar to that in sheep (Hadlow et al.

0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	168	, 1999), this observation indicates that white-tailed deer can be infected as adults, as reported in mule deer (Miller  and  Williams, 2003) or that the incubation period can be as long as 5 years.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Failure to detect PrPd in some deer is less likely to be due to genetic differences than to the termination of the entire herd for regulatory reasons while some or all deer were in the very early stage of the disease, before PrPd is detectable.
0.18326303.15105552.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Long-term observations of heavily exposed herds or direct oral challenge of captive deer will be needed to establish relative disease resistance in deer with the rare genotypes.

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	6	By taking advantage of `prion-resistant' polymorphisms that naturally exist in sheep and humans, an alternative approach can be envisaged.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Genotype analyses in sheep has shown that the polymorphism present at codon 171 of the ovine Prnp gene is correlated with the disease incidence and the modulation of its incubation time.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Sheep carrying the polymorphisms Q/R or R/R at codon 171 of the PrP protein were resistant to different isolates of scrapie, whereas sheep harboring the Q/Q alleles developed prion disease (Belt et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Human genetic studies revealed that the gene encoding the prion protein has a large repertoire of polymorphisms and mutations.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Studies among the Japanese population found that, 12% carried the polymorphism E/K at codon 219 of the PrP protein, whereas the remainder carried the E/E alleles.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Because E/K-heterozygosity at codon 219 was not reported on the 85 autopsied cases of patients with sporadic CJD, this therefore suggests that the polymorphism E/K protects humans from prion diseases (Shibuya et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	12	 introduced the Q171R sheep mutation and E219K human mutation in the mouse Prnp gene (MoPrPQ167R and MoPrPQ218K respectively) (Kaneko et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These mutated PrPs could not be converted into the abnormal PrPSc isoform and, significantly, they also inhibited the formation of 3F4-tagged mouse PrPSc molecules during co-transfection experiments (Kaneko et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The substitutions Q167R and Q218K in MoPrP were therefore described as dominant negative mutants because they block the replication of their wild-type counterparts (Kaneko et al.

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Transgenic mice carrying PrP with Q167R or Q218K substitutions on a Prnp to / to  background, were unable to replicate and propagate prion diseases.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In transgenic mice, whose wild-type (wt) Prnp gene was re-inserted, the conversion of wt PrPC into PrPSc was dramatically slowed down and correlated with an increase in the incubation time in these animals.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This dominant negative effect seemed to depend on a particular ratio of the mutated PrP molecules produced by the transgene and the endogenous wt PrP molecules.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	19	These transgenic experiments demonstrate the relevance of the dominant negative mutants but because they are not directly applicable in gene therapy, it appeared necessary to develop vectors for their in vivo delivery.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The lentiviral gene transfer system is one of the most appropriate systems that could be employed.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We used the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) lentiviral vectors to evaluate a gene transfer therapeutic strategy.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Here, we show that FIV vectors carrying the MoPrPQ167R or MoPrPQ218K dominant negative mutants are able to abolish endogenous wt PrPSc replication in chronically prion-infected N2a58/22L cells.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, injections of virion preparations into mice, using the intracerebral (ic) or intravenous (iv) routes, demonstrate that our lentiviral vectors can transduce cells from brain and spleen tissues.

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Generally, these results show that the virions harboring the PrP dominant negative mutants are functional and that they are efficient to inhibit the endogenous wt PrPSc-conversion.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	150	 These results are in accordance with those obtained in previous studies (Kaneko et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	151	, 2002) who showed that inhibition of wt MoPrPSc-formation can occur with MoPrPQ167R and MoPrPQ218K mutants.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In addition, the lentiviral gene-transfer method allowed us to amplify the inhibitory effect of these dominant negative mutants in scrapie-infected cells.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	153	 The transient transfections of prion-infected cells performed by Kaneko et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	154	, 1997), resulted in only a minority of cells expressing the PrP mutants, which had an inhibitory effect only on the conversion of 3F4-tagged MoPrPC but not on the conversion of endogenous wild-type PrPC into PrPSc.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In our case, and because the majority of the cells expressed the PrP mutants, we were able to obtain a strong inhibition of the conversion of the endogenous wt PrPC into PrPSc.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Our results show that the delivery of dominant negative PrP mutants through lentiviral vectors, can not only provide a strong expression of the transgene, but also transdominantly inhibit the accumulation of the endogenous wt MoPrPSc in chronically scrapie-infected N2a58/22L cells.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	157	Lentiviral vectors possess the ability to transduce post-mitotic cells such as differentiated neurons as well as the cells of the lymphoreticular system in a prolonged and stable manner (Aguzzi et al.

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	159	 To analyse whether our lentiviral vectors had the potential to deliver the gene to the brain or the peripheric organs, we performed ic and iv injections of lentivirus expressing the ss-galactosidase gene in mice.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	160	 For ic delivery, we used a stereotaxic frame to inject the lentiviral preparation in the right lateral ventricle or in the thalamus of adult C57BL/6 mice.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	161	 ss-galactosidase expression was assessed by direct X-Gal staining of the entire brain.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Following the intrathalamic injection, we observed a ss-galactosidase activity mainly in the injection site (Fig.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	163	 4A,B,E), which demonstrated the capacity of our lentivirus to transduce neural cells.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Following intraventricular injection, X-Gal-blue coloration was limited all along the syringe trajectory and around the lateral ventricle (Fig.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This was probably owing to the diffusion of the lentiviral particle in the whole ventricle.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, close examination of the brain by immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to detect ss-galactosidase staining in the area of striatum, the cortex and in some more distant sites as well as the area of the cerebellum (Fig.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	167	 After systemic lentiviral injections, ss-galactosidase was observed around the blood vessels in the spleen of the mice and in some dispersed liver cells, probably due to the iv injection (Fig.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The spleen localisation in the vicinity of the vessels is somehow very pertinent because these structures are innervated by the noradrenergic peripheric autonomous nervous system implicated in the neuroinvasion process (Aguzzi et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These data showed that our lentiviral vectors can be used to transduce cells in the brain and in the spleen.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Because neurons are the main cells targeted in prion disease, the use of lentiviral vectors carrying dominant negative PrP mutants could slow or even prevent prion replication, at least in the brain area transduced with the virion particles.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In addition, the first stages of prion diseases are characterized by an increase of the PrPSc levels in the lymphoreticular system and in the spleen (Lasmezas et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Thus, lentiviral vectors could be useful effectors for the development of a gene therapy through repeated peripheral injections, with the aim of slowing down or preventing prion replication during the very early stages of disease, at least before neuroinvasion.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Moreover, a gene therapy strategy was recently evaluated by Marr et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	174	, as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Marr et al.

0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	176	 A single lentiviral injection decreased the number and size of amyloid plaques by about 45%.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Altogether, these data have encouraged us to further evaluate therapeutic strategies based on injections of the lentivirus carrying dominant negative PrP mutants, by both ic and peripheral routes.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Moreover, the recent and promising results of the neuroprotective cell-therapy treatment have prompted us to consider an approach combining both cell therapy and gene therapy using these dominant negative PrP mutants (Bachoud-Levi et al.
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	179	, 2001; Brustle and McKay, 1996; Lindvall, 2003; Lindvall and McKay, 2003).
0.19237107.15494372.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Indeed, neural precursors obtained after in vitro differentiation from embryonic stem cells could thus be transduced with the dominant negative PrP virion preparations before injection in the prion-infected brain.

0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	3	Although CWD is not perceived as an immediate major threat to deer or elk populations, it is of concern and interest for several reasons: (i) the possibility that wild herds could be gradually destroyed by CWD (Gross  and  Miller, 2001) due to the persistence of the infectious agent in the environment (Miller et al.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	4	, 2002) and the lethality of the disease; (ii) the unknown nature of circumstances, if any, under which this disease could affect a human; (iii) the greater understanding of human TSEs that could accrue by knowing more about related mammalian prion diseases that have not been well understood before; (iv) the economic impact of CWD on game farming; and (v) the possible spread of CWD to other members of the cervid family worldwide through unregulated commerce and transport of captive animals (Williams  and  Miller, 2003).
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	5	In other acquired prion diseases, notably scrapie of sheep and variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, amino acids encoded at certain key positions in the endogenous host prion protein (PrP) are strongly associated with susceptibility to TSE infection (Goldmann et al.

0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Alternatively, selection against the 225SS genotype by high CWD prevalence could produce areas of both high disease prevalence and high frequency of the SF genotype.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	125	 On an overall basis we saw no relationship between the proportions of SF animals estimated in HUs and the prevalence of CWD, but it may be necessary to compare proportions of SF and CWD prevalence in the same unit over time to detect such trends.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Whether the time scales required for such observations would be feasible is not known.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	127	 CWD is estimated to have been present in wild cervids for 50 years or more (Miller et al.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	128	, 2000), so the time over which such effects could have been at work in CWD endemic areas may be too short to show reduced disease prevalence in areas of high SF frequencies.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Also, the effect could be small compared with drift or mutation if CWD exerts only a low level of genetic selection because of its normally long incubation period, which allows for continued reproduction or genetic replacement, despite disease status.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The fact that we did not observe a relationship may also be due to the scale at which our observations have been made (i.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	131	 HUs), which are large relative to the population units most affected by variations in factors involved in the disease, including genetics (Conner  and  Miller, 2004).

0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This widely variable frequency of the 225F allele could be localized founder effects that are a legacy of demographic bottlenecks created in the historic past by intense market hunting of this species.
0.20848115.16033959.html.plaintext.txt	135	 An intriguing alternative is that it does reflect selection of genotype by CWD (directional or balancing) without detectable trends in disease prevalence, or is an example of population genetic differentiation such as isolation by distance.

0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The incidence of copper toxicosis in the general population is low (6, 46).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Acute copper poisoning is not frequent but is usually the consequence of consumption of contaminated foodstuffs or beverages, or from accidental or deliberate ingestion of high quantities of copper salts.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Acute copper poisoning is characterized with nausea, vomiting, and gastric pain.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In severe cases, intravascular hemolytic anemia, acute hepatic failure, acute tubular renal failure, shock, coma, and death can occur (46).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	9	Chronic copper toxicosis may be of greater concern (6).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Nutritional studies of chronic copper overload in both mice and rats have shown copper-induced liver damage in these animals (1, 19, 38).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In addition, WD, a human genetic disorder of copper overload, is characterized by a gradual hepatic accumulation of copper that eventually results in liver cirrhosis (7).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Other copper overload disorders in humans include Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis (ETIC), and idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These diseases result in abnormal hepatic copper accumulation and can result in chronic hepatitis and hepatic failure (36).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although the liver injury in each of these cases is copper induced, the mechanisms by which excess copper results in cellular toxicity have not been fully elucidated.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The increase in copper levels, especially in WD, occurs over a period of many years, and phenotypic consequences are not reported until copper levels are extremely elevated.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The lack of appreciable pathological changes from ever increasing copper levels until late in the disease process suggests that compensatory homeostatic mechanisms must exist.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	17	Toxicity resulting from copper overload has long been hypothesized to result from the redox cycling Haber-Weiss reaction in which cuprous ions react with H2O2 to form highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn catalyze the oxidation of biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (reviewed in Refs.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The suspected role of ROS in copper overload is supported by observations of increased generation of lipid peroxidation products, as well as evidence of DNA damage in hepatocytes reacted with ionic copper (6, 59).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In vivo studies have shown that markers of lipid peroxidation are increased in mitochondria from livers of WD patients (55).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	20	 There is also evidence of lipid peroxidation in livers of rats chronically fed very high copper diets (38, 54).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	21	The levels at which copper becomes toxic is not clear.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Most studies that indicate that copper causes oxidative stress have tested very high levels of copper (38, 54).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Indeed, a study in which a diet with moderately high levels of copper was fed to rats showed no lipid peroxidation (1).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	24	 DNA damage, often a consequence of oxidative stress, has been observed in copper overload in vivo, however, only in the cirrhotic livers of WD patients (21).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nevertheless, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with WD is not higher than that in the general population (50).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This raises the question of whether copper, at moderately elevated levels, results in oxidative damage, and if not, what effects, if any, these levels have on cells.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Clearly, the cellular mechanisms that protect the cell are vigorous, and only at very high levels do they become overwhelmed.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We currently have only a limited understanding of the protective systems that operate in cells chronically exposed to copper.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Additionally, the limits of homeostatic regulation are not known, making it difficult to define the milder effects of copper excess (3).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Currently no early, biologically relevant markers of copper excess exist.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	31	 A robust assay to facilitate the diagnosis of copper excess and to distinguish mild, moderate, and severe copper overload is needed.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	32	To address these issues, we have investigated the effects on steady-state gene expression of chronic copper overload in a cell culture model system using cDNA microarray technology.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	33	 For this study we have chosen to utilize cells from a genetic model of copper overload.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We have used fibroblast cells from two mouse mutants, C57BL/6-Atp7aMobr and C57BL/6-Atp7aModap (henceforth to be referred to as Mobr and Modap, respectively, for simplicity) as genetic models of chronic copper overload.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Cultured cells from mice with mutations in the Atp7a represent genetic models of moderate cellular copper overload (12, 32).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Excess copper is normally exported by the ATP7A copper transporting P-type ATPase, which translocates from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the presence of elevated copper (45).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Mutations in ATP7A in both humans (Menkes disease) and mice (mottled mouse) lead to reduced intestinal basolateral export of copper and subsequent systemic copper deficiency (33).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	38	 All cultured cells tested, with the exception of hepatic cells, from mottled mice accumulate copper to abnormally high levels in normal culture media (12, 32).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Our results show no evidence of oxidative stress in the copper-loaded cells and suggest remarkable cellular compensation.

0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	233	We utilized cDNA microarray technology to investigate the effects of chronic copper overload.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The microarray experiments, which compared transcripts from each mutant (Mobr and Modap) to a control cell line, were carried out four times per mutant.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	235	 For the analysis of the individual microarray data sets, we employed a novel, data-driven approach, recently developed in our laboratory, for identifying differentially expressed genes.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The resulting lists of significantly up- and downregulated genes from each individual microarray were then compared with each other and showed high reproducibility.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	237	An investigation into the functions of the differentially expressed genes led us to some surprising results.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Copper is thought to be toxic if allowed to accumulate in excess of cellular needs because of its ability to generate free radicals (6).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Indeed, there are reports of copper-induced oxidative damage at high doses of exposure (55).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Hence, we expected that many of the differentially expressed genes would be those that encoded proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Surprisingly, both mottled cell lines, despite being chronically copper overloaded, show no differential expression of oxidative stress genes besides the upregulation of MT1.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	242	 MT1, long known to be induced by copper (and other heavy metals) and to be elevated in the cultured fibroblasts (and other nonhepatic cell lines) from both Menkes patients (25, 49) and mottled mice (41), was upregulated in the Mobr cells, (it was not on the array and, therefore, not assayed in the Modap cells).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In contrast, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), one of the main intracellular antioxidants, and -glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCL), a regulator of glutathione synthesis, which previously has been shown to be upregulated under oxidative stress (13, 35), were not induced in either of the two cell lines.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In support of our findings is a recent study that showed that fibroblasts from Menkes patients, despite having intracellular copper levels five times that of control cells, had decreased basal oxidative stress and a more efficient protection toward free radicals than fibroblasts from controls (18).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Their results, which included measurements of redox metal content, antioxidant equipment, and oxidative stress markers, showed that the activity of catalase and GPX, TBARS (a marker of lipid peroxidation), and the production of hydrogen peroxide were all decreased in the Menkes (MNK) cells.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Metallothionein production was also increased in the MNK cells.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Together, these data suggest that chronic exposure to moderately elevated intracellular levels of copper does not induce oxidative damage to cells; instead, we observe evidence of an adaptive response to copper.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	248	A large number of differentially expressed genes in both the Mobr and Modap cell lines are involved in cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion (Table 2).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The relationship between cytoskeletal organization and copper metabolism is not known.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	250	 It is possible that copper may be affecting the cytoskeleton directly.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Polymerization/depolymerization of actin and tubulin is regulated in part by divalent metal-ion-binding sites, generally for Ca2+ and Mg2+; thus other divalent metals may act as potential toxic interferers (58).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Whether copper or other metal ions actually compete with or displace Ca2+ or Mg2+ in the cytoskeleton is not known, but there is evidence that zinc, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium can disrupt actin and microtubules in intact cells (58).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Another possible explanation of the expression changes could be an indirect effect secondary to lysyl oxidase (LO) deficiency.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	254	 LO is a copper-containing protein that is responsible for the formation of lysine-derived cross-links in connective tissue, particularly in collagen and elastin (52).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	255	 LO activity has been shown to be decreased in fibroblasts from patients with Menkes disease (17, 51).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Hence, alterations in the extracellular matrix could have a downstream effect on the cytoskeleton and lead to the observed changes in gene expression.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Additionally, amyloid precursor protein, induced in our models of copper overload and whose function is still undetermined, has been shown to interact with collagen, sharing common binding sites with heparin, and has been proposed to be a mediator of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions (56).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The changes we observed could also be due to changes in function of this protein.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Furthermore, defects in the trafficking of the ATP7A protein may be leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Normally, the ATP7A protein traffics between the TGN and the plasma membrane and is vesicle mediated (45, 42).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The molecular mechanisms responsible for membrane trafficking of ATP7A have recently been under extensive investigation and may involve cytoskeletal factors that have yet to be identified.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	262	In search of the genes that may be involved in the putative adaptive response, we investigated the specific genes that were differentially expressed in both the Mobr and Modap cell lines.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	263	 It is important to note that two different microarrays were used for each set of experiments, and it is possible that significant genes from the Mobr experiments were not assayed in the Modap experiments, and vice versa.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Nevertheless, we compared the 193 and 130 reproducible genes from each mutant, and 12 genes were found to be similarly differentially expressed in the mutants (Table 1).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Because of the different microarrays, the true number of similar genes may, in fact, be higher.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Interestingly, 2 of the 12 genes found to be upregulated in both the Mobr and Modap mutant were App and Prnp.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	267	The protein products of these genes are involved in the pathology of two neurodegenerative diseases, AD and prion disease, respectively.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The identification of copper binding sites on both of these proteins suggests a possible role in copper homeostasis (61).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	269	 APP is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and, although the function is unknown, is likely to play an important role in normal cell physiology.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	270	 APP contains two copper-binding sites and is able to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) in vitro (37).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	271	 APP is the precursor of the ss-amyloid (Ass) peptide, which constitutes the characteristic amyloid plaques of AD.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The homeostasis of copper is significantly altered in the AD brain (57).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Copper inhibits ss-amyloid production by stimulating the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP (5); however, in vitro, copper induces aggregation of the soluble amyloid peptide, suggesting a role in both the processing of APP and amyloid plaque assembly and may contribute to AD development (24).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	274	 App to / to  mice have increased copper in their livers and in the cerebral cortex, with no change in their serum (63).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	275	 App to / to  neurons are less sensitive to copper toxicity compared with wild-type cells (62).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	276	 These observations led Strausak et al.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	277	 (57) to suggest that the amyloid precursor protein could be involved in the release of copper from the cell.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	278	Our results, demonstrating upregulation of App in both genetic models and a nutritional model of chronic copper overload, support a role for this protein in copper homeostasis.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Recently the Menkes protein was overexpressed in human fibroblasts (a state of decreased intracellular copper), and the researchers showed that copper depletion significantly reduced APP protein levels and downregulated App gene expression (4).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	280	 We suggest that the adaptive response to moderately elevated levels of copper may involve the amyloid precursor protein.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	281	Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which include scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), result in fatal neurodegenerative conditions (47).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In prion disease, it is thought that the pathogenic process is related to transformation of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a protease-resistant and readily aggregated isoform, called PrPsc (scrapie prion protein) (31).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Evidence is mounting that copper may play a role in PrPc biology (9).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The Prnp to / to  mouse has decreased copper levels in the brain and liver, whereas copper levels in their serum were increased (10).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In addition, cell lines from Prnp to / to  mice are more sensitive to copper exposure (11).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The prion protein may therefore represent a potential copper-transporting or -sequestering protein that may prevent copper toxicity (9).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	287	Our results demonstrate upregulation of Prnp in the genetic models but not the nutritional model of chronic copper overload.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The copper-treated cells, although copper loaded, still have the capability to export copper, whereas the mutant cells do not.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	289	 It could be that prion protein is functioning secondarily to copper export, thus protecting the cell from copper toxicity only when copper s normal export is disrupted.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Additionally, cellular distribution of copper may be different between the genetic and the nutritional models, and this may have an effect on the prion protein.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Clearly, further studies on the role of this protein in copper overload are needed.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	292	Copper exposure has been proposed to play a role in cardiovascular disease and cancer, in addition to neurodegenerative diseases (8, 16, 23, 61).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Although overt copper toxicity is relatively rare, signs of moderate copper overload may be more common (6).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The relationship between these conditions and the effects of chronic copper exposure has not been adequately assessed, possibly due to the inadequacy of current methodology for assessment of copper status (3, 34).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Currently there is no effective measure of copper overload besides invasive liver biopsy (36).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) levels (53) can be decreased in copper deficiency, but since Cp is an acute phase protein, levels can be elevated in a variety of inflammatory conditions independent of copper levels (34).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Clearly, there is need for a more robust assay to facilitate the diagnosis of copper excess and to distinguish mild, moderate, and severe copper overload.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	298	Gene expression patterns could serve as biomarkers of exposure or effect (2, 40, 44).
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We have compared our results to all published studies (as of January 2004) on the gene expression effects of nutrient and xenobiotic exposure on mammalian cells and found no significant overlap of differentially expressed genes assayed.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	300	 These include studies of several metals such as arsenic and cadmium.
0.21379416.15467011.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Thus we suggest that the genes which we have identified to be differentially expressed in both Mobr and Modap cells lines may be specific for chronic copper exposure.

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, December 18, 2003 , and in revised form, March 16, 2004.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	3	A large number of transcription factors have been described to recruit Sin3 to target genes.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	4	 These include: Pf1, TIEG2, Opi1, Mnt, Mad family members, and S.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The interaction between Mad and Sin3 is of great interest as it targets deacetylation and repression of transcription to genes required for proliferation of cells.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mad belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein family and is part of the Myc/Mad/Max network.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The tumor suppressor Mad and the proto-oncogene Myc independently heterodimerizes with Max to form complexes capable of targeting the hexanucleotide core sequences 5'-CACGTG-3' enhancer box present on specific promoters such as cyclin D2, htert, and Id2 (24-29).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The Myc/Max heterodimer can recruit the TRRAP/GCN5 complex containing HAT activity in proliferating cells, as opposed to the Mad/Max heterodimer, which recruits the Sin3 complex triggering deacetylation of histones in differentiation (30-32).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	9	Interactions between Sin3 and transcription factors are mediated by four PAH domains within the Sin3 protein.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Opi1, pf1, N-CoR, and the SMRT co-repressor have been described to interact with PAH1 (33, 34).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	11	 PAH2 has been reported to interact with Mad family members, Mnt, Ume6, as well as with TIEG2 and Pf1.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	12	 So far, PAH3 has been shown to interact with SAP30.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Recently glycosylation was linked to transcriptional repression by showing interaction between PAH4 and O-Glc-NAc transferase (35).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	14	 A minimal conserved binding motif consisting of the N terminus residue 8-20 of Mad1 was established to interact strongly to PAH2 (36).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The interaction between the PAH2 domain of Sin3 with the SID of Mad has been characterized in detail by NMR.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	16	 PAH2 folds as a wedged four-helix bundle structure that is stabilized upon complex formation with the Mad-SID, which adopts an amphipathic -helix (37, 38).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although the four domains have a high degree of homology, they seem to interact with distinct subsets of factors.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Structural prerequisites of PAH interactors for a stable interaction with a PAH domain seem to be -helicity and amphipathicity, but the structural studies do not shed light on the role of individual residues in binding and specificity.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	19	Here, to uncover residues that convey the specificity of interaction between PAH2 and Mad, PAH2 residues contacted by the Mad-SID were introduced into the PAH1 domain of mSin3b and tested for gain of interaction.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We report that the insertion of PAH2-specific residue Phe-7 in PAH1 conveyed an interaction with the Mad-SID.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Stabilization of Mad-SID interaction with PAH1-Phe-7 occurred upon extra insertion of Val-14 and Gln-39.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Strikingly, in PAH2, Phe-7 was further identified as a critical residue.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Overall, we established Phe-7 as the most important molecular determinant of the interaction between PAH2 and Mad.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	24	GST-PAH1 or PAH2 (10  microg) were incubated with ProtG-Mad and bound to IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	143	 To achieve this, a stop codon was inserted downstream of the Mad sequence before the second cysteine, thus creating a C terminus.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In this C-terminal, "flexible" context, Mad-SID strongly interacted with PAH2 but not detectably with PAH1, and hence the specificity of interaction was not altered in this context (Fig.

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Noticeably, the gain of free movement by Mad-SID tolerated and partially compensated for the loss of interaction because of V14L and Q39K, but not when the mutation F7V was present.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	166	To extend and validate in a cell-free system the observed role of PAH residues 7, 14, and 39 in the interaction with Mad, we used the IgG pull-down assay.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	167	 PAH1 and PAH2 mutants were fused to GST, purified, and incubated with fixed amounts of immobilized ProtG-Mad bound to IgG-Sepharose beads (Fig.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In the context of PAH1, Phe-7 partially facilitated binding to Mad-SID, which was further enhanced with the inclusion of Val-14 and/or Gln-39.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Val-14 in the context of PAH1 displayed some binding to the Mad-SID, whereas Gln-39 was unable to support an interaction.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Overall, the in vitro data show that Phe-7 is the residue that contributes most for binding, followed by Val-14 and Gln-39.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In the reverse situation, mutation in PAH2 of Phe-7 abolished the interaction in vitro, as observed in the yeast two-hybrid setting.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Mutating Gln-39 in PAH2 slightly affected the interaction, whereas no effect could be observed when Val-14 was mutated.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Combining Phe-7 and Gln-39 mutations yielded background levels as observed in vivo.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Mutations combining Phe-7 and Val-14 in PAH2 resulted in a substantial interaction, whereas no effect could be observed from combining Val-14 and Gln-39.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	175	 We conclude that the phenylalanine at position 7 is the specific, critical molecular determinant of complex formation between PAH2 and Mad-SID in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid assay, as well as in vitro in a direct interaction assay.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	176	An analysis of interatomic contacts of structural units (CSU) on the NMR structure of the PAH2 domain of msin3b with the Mad-SID revealed possible molecular contacts of Phe-7, Val-14, and Gln-39.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Gln-39 side-chain displays some atomic contacts with Leu-13 of the Mad-SID.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Mutating Gln-39 to a Lys does not change the length of the side-chain, but changes the charge.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Thereby, Lys-39 would maintain atomic contacts with Leu-13 of the Mad-SID and, thus, does not provide an explanation for Gln-39 stabilizing role.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Remarkably, Gln-39 displays many hydrophilic-hydrophilic contacts with other PAH2 residues, such as His-36, Thr-37, Tyr-38, and Gln-42.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, Gln-39 could have an important role in charge maintenance.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	182	 A lysine mutation would lead to a unilateral positive charge and, as a consequence, these hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions could be affected and disturb the folding of PAH2.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	183	Careful inspection of the NMR structure with respect to Val-14 residue as well as CSU analysis show intermolecular contacts with conserved residues Leu-12, Ala-15, Ala-16, and Leu-19 of the Mad-SID.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	184	 It has already been remarked that the short side-chain of Ala-15 and Ala-16 of the Mad-SID might play a crucial role in allowing the maintenance of the PAH2/Mad-SID interface.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Val-14 fits in a hole formed by Ala-15, Ala-16, and Leu-19 of the Mad-SID (38).
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Replacement of Val-14 with a leucine would increase the side-chain length.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	187	 This increase could generate a distance as close as 2.

0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Based upon the results from our experiments, structural information, and modeling, a stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of Phe-7 and Tyr-18 is most likely the key to the complex formation between PAH2 and Mad.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	207	In conclusion, interaction between the Sin3 co-repressor, the tumor suppressor Mad, and other PAH interactors seems to be characterized by conserved properties such as amphipathicity and -helicity and reach their specificity at a molecular level through residues such as Phe-7 that is present only at the PAH2 domain of Sin3.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Open questions remain on understanding the specificity of PAH1, PAH3, and PAH4 and their interacting partners.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Consensus sequences for PAH-interacting protein are still unsolved and subject to many questions.
0.21711254.15047710.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Ultimately, a definition of the specificity of every PAH domain can provide a new way to identify the residues required and needed in amphipathic -helix motifs of Sin3-interacting members, enlarging our molecular view of the role of the Sin3 co-repressor complex in transcriptional repression and cell growth.

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	7	In contrast to short-term memory, long-term memory (i.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	8	 the ability to retain information for several hours, days and even years) depends on de novo protein synthesis and on long-term changes in the molecular components of the neuronal synapse (5).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, little is known about the cell biology and molecular mechanisms that initiate and maintain these structural changes.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Recent experiments in yeast and Aplysia suggest that a prion-like protein switch might help to maintain long-term synaptic changes required for the formation of long-term memory.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Specifically, it has been shown that a neuronal isoform of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates local protein synthesis and stabilizes synapse-specific long-term facilitation in Aplysia (6).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, Aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties when expressed in yeast and it is the self-perpetuating prion-like form of CPEB that has the capacity to activate translationally dormant mRNA (7).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These studies led to the radically new notion that prion-like conformational changes may be a key event for the maintenance of structural synaptic changes underlying long-term memory.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	14	 If the conversion of proteins into a self-perpetuating state represents a mechanism for long-term memory storage, genes encoding proteins with prion-like properties are excellent candidates for association with human long-term memory capacity.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	15	In humans, the only protein with well-characterized prion properties is the prion protein PrP, encoded by the PRNP gene on the short arm of chromosome 20.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	16	 PRNP is polymorphic with intronic, 5'- and 3'-UTR SNPs as well as a common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 (M129V), which modulates the folding behavior of the protein (8,9) and controls susceptibility to prion diseases (10).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Human genetic variation is often organized into population-specific haplotype blocks, i.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	18	 areas of the genome with substantial correlations among neighboring alleles (11).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In populations of Caucasian origin, genetic variability of PRNP is represented by a haplotype block spanning 25 kb including the M129V SNP (www.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	20	 On the basis of the recent experimental observations related to the mechanisms of long-term memory formation (6,7), we hypothesized that human genetic variability of PRNP might be related to long-term memory and, therefore, investigated the influence of polymorphic sites within PRNP on memory capacity in 354 healthy young subjects (Table 1).

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The methionine to valine substitution at codon 129 of PRNP (M129V) is caused by a common A to G transition (rs1799990); the threonine to methionine substitution at codon 174 of PRND (T174M) is caused by a common C to T transition (rs2245220).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	28	 All PRNP SNPs were significantly (P0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	29	01) associated with long-term memory performance, with M129V (underlined) yielding the most significant result.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	30	 T174M and rs1029273 failed to reach significant levels of association.

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Long-term memory performance (median split) served as the dependent binary variable.

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The curves of 129MM carriers (n=159) and of 129MV carriers (n=151) are essentially identical.

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Influence of PRNP and adjacent polymorphisms on long-term memory (24 h free recall of words) in the entire sample and the two subsamples   Exclusion of nearby genomic loci Next, we investigated whether the observed association of the M129V SNP with long-term memory was due to linkage disequilibrium with a nearby genetic variation.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In the 3' flanking region of PRNP, we analyzed the T174M substitution of the PRND gene, which is located 25 kb 3' to the M129V SNP and encodes the PrP homologue doppel (Fig.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Twenty five kilobases 5' to the M129V SNP we analyzed SNP rs1029273 which has been previously shown to confer susceptibility for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) independently of the M129V polymorphism (12).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Consistent with existing data in the populations of Caucasian origin (www.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	42	com), the three PRNP SNPs and the 5'-flanking SNP rs1029273 were part of a haplotype block in our study population (multi-allelic D'=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	43	000001) with the PRNP SNPs exerting the highest LD values.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The T174M SNP of PRND was not part of the haplotype (D'=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Of note, none of the examined SNPs deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Neither T174M nor rs102973 showed significant association with long-term memory performance (Fig.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Therefore, we conclude that the codon 129 polymorphism fully accounts for the association between the PRNP locus and long-term memory.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	48	Exclusion of non-random genetic heterogeneity Association studies in outbred populations such as the present one may be prone to false-positivity because non-random genetic heterogeneity within the study sample (i.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	49	 population structure) can lead to spurious associations between a candidate marker and a phenotype (13).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Therefore, we calculated the structure of genetic heterogeneity in our study population by genotyping each subject for 318 SNPs located in both genic and non-genic regions and distributed over all autosomes.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Structured association analysis (14) revealed a low allele-frequency divergence in our population (Kullback-Leibler distance=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The individual genetic background values were normally distributed (P=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Ten subjects were identified as outliers (i.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	54	 beyond the 25 or 75% limits of the normal distribution curve).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Importantly, our findings remained unchanged after exclusion of these subjects from the statistical analyses.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In addition, we included each subject's genetic background value as a covariate in each analysis.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Again, the results remained unchanged.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Therefore, we conclude that the significant association of the M129V SNP with long-term memory is independent of the observed genetic heterogeneity levels of our population.

0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Using 318 unlinked SNPs, structured association analysis revealed low allele-frequency divergence among populations (Kullback-Leibler distance=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The superimposed curve indicates normal distribution of the data (P=0.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Ten subjects were identified as outliers (i.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	64	 outside the 25 or 75% limits of the normal distribution curve).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Identical results were obtained under the a priori assumption of 3K6 discrete subpopulations.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	66	In vitro experiments suggest that the 129M allele results in a higher propensity of the prion protein to form beta-sheet-rich oligomers (9).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Recently, transgenic mice expressing human PrP with methionine 129, but not valine 129, presented with a variant CJD-related phenotype (15).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These findings indicate that the 129M allele may facilitate self-perpetuating conformational changes of the human prion protein.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Interestingly, our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of the 129M allele on long-term memory in healthy young subjects and therefore support the hypothesis that a prion-based mechanism is involved in the formation of long-term memory.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	70	Is the association of the PRNP locus with human long-term memory related to the susceptibility for prion diseases? In humans, but not in any other mammalian species (16), PRNP displays the common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Approximately 40% of our population was heterozygous for this polymorphism, which is in line with reports in middle European populations (17).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, 129MM and 129VV homozygotes are heavily over-represented in sporadic CJD and iatrogenic CJD (10).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In addition, all victims of variant CJD, which is thought to result from infection with bovine prions, were found to be 129MM homozygotes (18).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Therefore, 129MV heterozygosity appears to be protective against prion infection (10,19).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	75	 We observed that the methionine allele correlated dominantly with better long-term memory, because we were unable to discern any difference between the 129MM and the 129MV subgroups.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Therefore, the association of the PRNP locus with human long-term memory seems to be unrelated to the susceptibility for prion diseases.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	77	Although prions were originally described as transmissible pathogens (20), the induction of a self-perpetuating conformational change within populations of cellular proteins does not always need to be deleterious (21).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	78	 For example, the Podospora anserina prion, Het-S, may confer a selection advantage to its host (22).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Also, the Sup35 translational termination factor may act as a useful evolutionary buffer for infected yeast (23).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Finally, the CPEB protein which is involved in the maintenance of long-term synaptic changes (6) has been shown to possess prion-like properties when expressed in yeast (7).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	81	 One might therefore speculate that the impact of PrP variants on long-term memory in healthy humans is related to physiologically occurring conformational changes (24).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	82	Taken together, the human prion protein is genetically associated with long-term memory.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Further evaluation of the biological consequences of the M129V polymorphism in neurons will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this association.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	84	Memory capacity was tested during two consecutive days.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	85	 On the first day, subjects viewed six series of five semantically unrelated nouns presented at a rate of one word per second with the instruction to learn the words for immediate free recall after each series.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In addition, subjects underwent an unexpected delayed free-recall test of the learned words after 5 min and again after 24 h.
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Both delayed recall tests reflect episodic memory (25).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In contrast to the 5 min recall, the 24 h recall additionally requires long-term synaptic changes (5).
0.26525193.15987701.html.plaintext.txt	89	 To control for type I statistical error and for effects of educational level on memory, we recruited two independent populations of either university students (academic group) or non-academic employees/trainees (non-academic group).

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	4	The first gene distal to PRNP in eutherian mammals is PRND, which encodes the doppel (Dpl) protein (Moore et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	5	 1999) and is thought to have arisen by a duplication of PRNP (Mastrangelo and Westaway 2001).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The next neighbor gene to PRND, detected so far only in humans and not present in mouse, is the related PRNT gene (Makrinou, Collinge, and Antoniou 2002), which seems to be a pseudogene that has arisen from duplication of PRND.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	7	The complexity of the mammalian PRNP locus and the conundrum of PrP function provided the impetus for searching publicly available genomic sequence databases of human (Lander et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	8	 2001) and model vertebrates (Aparicio et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	9	 2002) to discover PrP paralogs in silico.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	10	 As these paralog genes may have functions related to those of PrP, their characterization may illuminate its functions and reveal the basis for PrP's disease associations.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The paralogs themselves may be indicated to be potential drug targets (Lander et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	12	Using this comparative genomics approach, we recently manually annotated a new gene, SPRN, that is a paralog of PRNP (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	13	 SPRN was detected in mammals (human, mouse, rat) and fish (Fugu, Tetraodon, zebrafish).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It encodes the Shadoo (Sho) protein, and is better conserved between mammals and fish than is PRNP (fig.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	20	  Several other genes encoding proteins with homology to PrP have also been described recently in fish only (table 1): PrP-like protein from Fugu, Tetraodon, and zebrafish (Suzuki et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	21	 2002), a protein from Fugu and Tetraodon named PrP461 (Rivera-Milla, Stuermer, and Malaga-Trillo 2003) or stPrP-1 (Oidtmann et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	22	 2003), and stPrP-2 from Fugu and stPrP from salmon (Oidtmann et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast to Shos, these new fish proteins are not well conserved among the major fish lineages nor among mammalian or other vertebrate PrPs (frog, reptile, and bird).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	24	View this table:    Table 1 Summary of Vertebrate Proteins and Genes Related to PrP, Dpl, and Sho.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	25	  However, despite divergence of their amino acid sequences, many overall protein features peculiar to these proteins are conserved; these features are summarized in figure 1.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	26	 First, all these proteins are extracellular and predicted to be GPI-anchored and, with the exception of the most divergent PrP-like proteins, are also actually or potentially N-glycosylated.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, PrPs and stPrPs do, or can be predicted to, contain a disulfide bond.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Next, all mature proteins have basic regions and, except for frog PrP, repeats.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The most characteristic feature of all PrPs and fish proteins related to PrP is a middle stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, which in mammals is essential for the pathogenic PrP isotype conversion (Prusiner 1998).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Sho protein shares with these PrPs this unique property of a middle non to membrane-spanning hydrophobic region (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In contrast, the Dpl sequence lacks both repeat and hydrophobic regions and shows homology only to the C-terminal folded domain of PrP.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	32	In addition to the serious problem of transmission of prion disease among mammals and to humans in the recent bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis arising from feeding of contaminated mammal-derived proteins to cows, these new findings of PrP homologs in fish raise new issues: the possibility of spread of prion disease to farmed fish from mammals (and vice versa?) from meat and bone meal feedstuff derived from farm animals.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Hence, understanding the evolution of the fish proteins and definition of their functions appear both critical and timely for defining the function, and dysfunction, of the mammalian PrPs, as a means for understanding the transmissibility of infectious prion disease.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	34	Genes in different species defined as orthologous by their derivation from a common ancestor generally lie in the same genomic context and perform the same function; this property is the basis for prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes (O'Brien et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Although this comparative genomics approach is a powerful tool for understanding biological function, the appropriate evolutionary distance of species in a comparison depends on the biological question addressed (Frazer et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For example, a comparative study of custom-sequenced genomic data for four yeast species that diverged 5 to 20 MYA allowed a complete analysis for gene identification, determination of gene structures, estimate of rapid/slow evolutionary changes, detection of regulatory elements, detection of combinatorial control of expression, and identification of the key regulatory elements determining gene activity (Kellis et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	37	 However, there are limitations in the depth and extent of possible mammalian comparative genomic analysis, which parallel availability of eutherian, marsupial, and monotreme lineage representatives (O'Brien, Eizirik, and Murphy 2001; Graves and Westerman 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The most comprehensive targeted comparative genomic analysis reported to date included 13 vertebrate species (one human, eight other mammals, one bird, and three fish) and allowed identification of conserved coding and noncoding sequences as well as insight into the genome dynamics (Thomas et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	39	The aim of this work is to analyze the evolutionary relationships among mammalian PRNP and fish genes encoding proteins related to PrP, and also their relationships with SPRN from mammals and fish, by means of comparative genomic analysis.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This analysis comprises both homology and nonhomology criteria for assessing gene orthology (Eisen and Wu 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Apart from identification of gene similarity (homology criteria), we tested whether homologous rearrangement events have occurred in the intergenic regions (nonhomology criteria).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Conserved order and transcription orientation with respect to adjacent gene or genes, also dubbed "conserved contiguity," implies that there has been no rearrangement in the intergenic regions and that the genes share common evolutionary history.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This is suggested to be a strong indication of orthology (Comparative Genome Organization Workshop 1996; Gilligan, Brenner, and Venkatesh 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	44	Our analysis is based on sequence data available in public databases.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Apart from human, only two vertebrate genome sequences are available in draft form: those for mouse (Waterston et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	46	 2002) and tiger pufferfish Fugu rubripes (Aparicio et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Substantial data for the rat genome is also available (http://www.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Rodents are separated from human by 75 Myr of independent evolution, and mouse and rat (separated by 30 Myr) are the major mammalian models for genetic and immunological research and physiological research, respectively.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Fish are at the root of vertebrate diversification, and extant fish are separated from mammals by 450 Myr of independent evolution.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The compact vertebrate genome of Fugu rubripes was proposed as a tool for discovery of vertebrate genes and their regulatory elements (Brenner et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	54	 1993), and, indeed, its draft genome sequence showed significant conservation of protein-coding genes, intron-exon structures, and gene arrangement with human (Aparicio et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Partial genomic sequence information is also available for green pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (http://www.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	56	fr/), which diverged from Fugu 20 to 30 MYA, and also for zebrafish Danio rerio (http://www.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	57	org/), which diverged 100 to 150 MYA from pufferfish and is a popular experimental model in developmental studies.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The availability of genome information has led to increased recent interest in zebrafish as a model system for human disease (Ward and Lieschke 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	59	Here, we compare genomic sequences, including adjacent genes, protein alignments, and phylogenetic analysis of mammalian PRNP, related fish genes, and SPRN genes from mammals and fish, together with their adjacent genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	60	 We provide detailed descriptions of the mammalian PRNP, PRND, PRNT, and SPRN genes, and performed "phylogenetic footprinting" on the aligned human, mouse, and Fugu SPRN genes to define possible regulatory regions and transcription factor to binding sites.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	61	 We present evidence for novel fish genes related to PrP that we identified in public databases: stPrP-2 from Tetraodon and stPrP-3 from zebrafish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	62	 We derived the SPRN sequence coding for Sho experimentally from Tetraodon, and for Fugu, Tetraodon, carp, and zebrafish, we found in silico a duplicated SPRN gene (SPRNB) encoding the related Shadoo2 protein (Sho2).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	63	 We have assessed orthology of the mammalian PRNP and fish genes related to PrP and the mammalian SPRN and homologous fish genes, respectively, and have inferred evolutionary patterns for the mammalian PRNP and SPRN genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	64	 We have developed an evolutionary model consistent with our various findings, as well as information available in the literature, and propose it as a framework for investigating gaps in knowledge in these genes, particularly in fish and tetrapod lineages.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	65	Detection of PRNP Genes and Genomic Environment in Human, Mouse, and Rat The PRNP genes in human (chr20p13: 4614996 to 4630236 bp), mouse (Chr2F3: 132911892 to 132940089 bp), and rat (Chr3Q36: 112889678 to 112890442 bp) were found by key word search of the Ensembl human (version 12.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	73	Identification of Tetraodon Sequences Containing PrP-like and stPrP-2 to Coding Genes We identified genomic contig FS_CONTIG_4238_2 containing the Tetraodon PrP-like and stPrP-2 to coding genes by using the sequence of the Tetraodon PrP-like ORF (Suzuki et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	74	 2002) as search query and the BlastN program provided in the Genoscope Web service.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	75	 We identified overlapping genomic clone FS_CONTIG_4238_1 by using the terminal 200 bp of FS_CONTIG_4238_2 as search query.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In addition, two more overlapping clones (FS_CONTIG_24895_1 and FS_CONTIG_31286_1) were identified by using the same strategy.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In the Fugu genome, stPrP-1 is flanked distally by TA-PPC2 (T-cell activation protein phosphatase 2C) and EPI-64 (epi64 protein).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Proximally, it is arranged head-to-head with a gene that appears to be a homolog, SPRNB, of the gene, SPRN, which we recently discovered encoding the protein Shadoo (Sho) (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	171	 2003); SPRNB, in turn, is flanked by KCNIP3 (calsenilin) (see also below).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In the zebrafish genome, we detected stPrP-1 adjacent to sprnb, also head-to-head, but flanked, interestingly, by the rassf2 gene proximally and the slk gene (STE20-like kinase) distally (i.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	173	, a different genomic environment from that in Fugu).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The proximity in fish of the two genes, stPrP-1 and SPRNB/sprnb, is very interesting, suggesting an evolutionary and possible functional link between stPrP-1 and Sho2 proteins.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	175	 We have not found the SPRNB gene in mammalian sequence databases.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There are several possible explanations; for example, the gene has been lost from the mammalian lineage, or it is so diverged that searches cannot recognize it.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The most obvious possibility, that the gene was duplicated after divergence of mammals and fish, is not consistent with phylogenetic results we present later.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	178	We found another stPrP-like gene, we here call stPrP-3, in zebrafish in the Ensembl genomic contig NA3274.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Its proximal flanking gene is unknown, but its distal flanking genes code for green cone photoreceptor (gcp) and annexin a6 (anxa6).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	180	We observe some major differences between the PrP-related genes in the mammalian and fish genomes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	181	 First, neither PRND nor PRNT genes were detected in fish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Although the similarity in position and orientation of PRNT in human and the PrP-like gene in pufferfish might suggest orthology, sequence comparison shows no similarity (i.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (2002) correctly noted that the genes encoding Rassf2 and Slc23a1 are in proximity to the PrP-like protein to coding gene in Fugu but reported them in a different gene order and relative gene orientation.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Rivera-Milla, Stuermer, and Malaga-Trillo (2003) stated that the genomic environments around the Fugu genes encoding PrP461 and PrP-like proteins seemed to have undergone multiple chromosomal rearrangements, but they did not present supporting data.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In the Fugu genomic data, Oidtmann et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	187	 (2003) found the stPrP-1 to coding gene on scaffold_96, and the stPrP-2 to coding gene on scaffold_155, adjacent to the PrP-like protein to coding gene; they concluded it was unlikely that ancestors of the stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 genes evolved directly into present mammalian forms of PRNP and PRND.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	188	 As supported by our later phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that stPrP-2 shares an ancestor with the fish gene encoding stPrP-1, but the gene duplication giving rise to stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 occurred after the evolutionary separation of fish and mammals.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Although stPrP-2 in pufferfish and PRNP in mammals share the same proximity to the Rassf2-coding and Slc23a1-coding genes and are likely orthologous, their sequences have diverged greatly, and they may have evolved significantly different functions.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The relaxation of conserved contiguity between the sites with different genes distal to PRNP and stPrP-2 (i.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	191	 PRND and PrP-like genes) suggests independent duplications producing PRNP-PRND and stPrP-2 and PrP-like genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	192	 As shown in figure 1, the C-terminal regions of PrP and stPrP-2 proteins have similar features, but these are not present in the PrP-like protein sequences; hence, the function of the PrP-like protein is likely different from that of stPrP-2.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Interestingly, we have recently detected an apparent duplication of the SPRN gene in human, about 140 kb downstream, from genomic data (L.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	196	 We obtained the Tetraodon SPRNA context by finding overlapping genomic sequence reads in the Genoscope database (http://www.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	199	) Genes adjacent to SPRN in mammals and SPRNA in pufferfish are those encoding the GTP-binding protein (GTP) and AO; both gene order and relative orientation are conserved in the two vertebrate clades, implying orthology.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, in zebrafish, although we found the GTP-binding to protein gene adjacent to sprna in the same tail-to-tail orientation, the proximal adjacent gene is the long-chain fatty-acyl elongase (fae) to coding gene rather than the AO-homologous gene.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Because the next proximal genes are not known from the assembly, it is not clear whether the AO-encoding gene is present.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	209	 First, we extracted 22,249 bp of genomic sequence containing the stPrP-2 to coding gene and its neighbor genes (FS_CONTIG_4238_2, FS_CONTIG_4238_1, FS_CONTIG_24895_1, FS_CONTIG_31286_1; Genoscope) and assembled it into the Tetraodon virtual contig 1.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	210	 To verify this assembly and assess its validity for our comparative genomic analysis, we aligned it to its orthologous Fugu genomic sequence using the PiPMaker program (Schwartz et al.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The dot plot indicates that the Tetraodon virtual contig 1 is assembled in an order consistent with the Fugu genomic sequence; we conclude the assembly is correct and valid for comparative analysis.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Additionally, we deduced the Tetraodon stPrP-2 amino acid sequence from the genomic sequence information (see later figure S3 of Supplementary Material online).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	217	Second, we identified 19,029 bp of Tetraodon genomic sequence (FS_CONTIG_4144_1, FS_CONTIG_31029_1, FS_CONTIG_37429_1; Genoscope) containing the SPRNA gene and adjacent genes, and merged it into the Tetraodon virtual contig 2.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The dot plot of 10 kb of this sequence aligned to orthologous Fugu genomic sequence (chr_scaffold_28: 384,496 to 394,338 bp; Ensembl) is shown in figure S1B of Supplementary Material online; this shows the GenScan exon predictions for the single-exon Sho ORF and for genes encoding AO and GTP-binding protein.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Untranslated gene fragments may contain regulatory sequences that affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency, so the choice of alternate polyadenylation sites may strongly affect expression of the gene (Beaudoing and Gautheret 2001).

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	332	 As the zebrafish contig does not contain the next proximal gene, it is not clear whether the synthetase gene is merely inserted or the AO-coding gene, which is found on another contig, is at another location.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	333	Conservation of the SPRN-coding exon between mammals and fish satisfies homology criteria for gene orthology.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Next, conserved gene order and relative transcription orientation of SPRN and its adjacent gene encoding GTP-binding protein (including also AO-coding gene in pufferfish) between mammals and fish indicates that no rearrangement occurred in this genomic fragment after the evolutionary divergence of fish and mammals 450 MYA.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Thus, we conclude that the SPRN gene is likely to be orthologous between mammals and fish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	336	Phylogenetic Footprinting of the SPRN Gene "Phylogenetic footprinting" is a method for identifying regulatory elements in a single gene by comparing orthologous sequences from several species (Blanchette and Tompa 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	337	 The basic assumption is that functional regions, including regulatory elements, are under greater selective pressure and will be more conserved between species than nonfunctional regions.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	348	 We next checked whether any known transcription factor to binding sites were among the detected motifs using the MatInspector program (Quandt et al.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Motifs 4, 14, and 16, labeled by an asterisk (*), denote potential nurr1, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and MAZR (MYC-associated zinc-finger protein to related) transcription factor to binding sites, respectively.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	356	  This combined analysis showed that three of the motifs detected by phylogenetic footprinting correspond to predicted transcription factor to binding sites, and, significantly, we note that these elements are present in the same relative order in the human and mouse sequences.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	357	 All three motifs were detected in the SPRN intron; we note, again, that this intron is free of transposable elements, so the presence of the motifs suggests the intron may play an important role in gene regulation.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	358	Motif 4 denotes the binding site for the nurr1 nuclear receptor, which is expressed only in brain and is known to play an important role in coordinate neuroendocrine regulation of activity of the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis (Murphy and Conneely 1997).

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	361	Motif 14 corresponds to the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) binding site.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	362	 ATF6 is a member of the basic leucine-zipper family.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	363	 It is involved in induction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, during which transcription of genes encoding molecular chaperones and folding enzymes located in the ER is upregulated.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Upstream to ATF6 in the ER stress response is IRE1 (Wang et al.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	374	 First, we deduced a sequence of 395 amino acids for Tetraodon stPrP-2 protein from the assembled genomic sequence.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Second, we translated the zebrafish stPrP-3 to coding sequence in Ensembl genomic contig NA3274.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	376	1 into a protein of 561 amino acids.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Third, based on the incomplete genomic sequence we had assembled, we cloned and sequenced the Tetraodon Sho ORF and deduced a 155-residue protein, thus adding a third fish Sho sequence to those for zebrafish and Fugu we had previously reported (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Last, as already discussed, we identified a new Sho-related class, Shadoo2 (Sho2), of sequences in public databases.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	379	 We were able to deduce Sho2 protein sequences of 150, 150, and 135 amino acids, respectively, from genomic information for Fugu (scaffold_96 from Ensembl), Tetraodon (FS_CONTIG_41464_1 from Genoscope), and zebrafish (ctg10456 from Ensembl).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Carp Sho2 was conceptually translated from EST data (CA964511 from NCBI) to give a protein of 145 amino acids.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	381	As described in Materials and Methods, the amino acid sequences of 11 PrP-related proteins from human, chicken, turtle, Xenopus, Fugu, Tetraodon, and zebrafish and 10 Sho and Sho2 proteins from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, Tetraodon, zebrafish and carp, were aligned independently using ClustalW (Thompson, Higgins, and Gibson 1994).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	382	 After refinement of the alignments using GDE (Smith et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	383	 1994), we assessed the alignments and chose 118 and 149 sites from the PrP-related and Sho/Sho2 proteins, respectively, for phylogenetic analyses using the maximum-likelihood program MOLPHY (Adachi and Hasegawa 1996).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	384	 The alignments are shown in figures S3 and S4 of Supplementary Material online.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	394	  The most-likely tree groups the human, chicken, turtle and frog sequences together to the exclusion of all fish sequences, as expected from known phylogeny.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Although the inferred evolutionary relationship among higher vertebrates has human PrP more distantly related to birds and reptiles than frog, the most likely tree is not significantly different from others consistent with the current view on tetrapod evolution (i.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	396	, with PrPHu and PrPFr changed over).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	397	 The divergence of the amino acid sequence between the fish proteins related to PrP and the PrPs of higher vertebrates suggests no orthology between these proteins.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	398	 The clustering pattern of the stPrPs also indicates that the genes coding for these proteins were duplicated in fish after the evolutionary split from tetrapods.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	399	The analysis of the Shadoo proteins identified a single most-likely tree, shown in figure 8, and 48 near-optimal trees, none of which differed significantly from the most likely tree.

0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	408	  The Shadoo tree indicates that Shos and Shos2s lie on two separate branches, implying these two genes duplicated before the divergence of fish from tetrapods.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Most importantly, the fish Shos cluster with their mammalian homologs, rather than with their fish Sho2 paralogs.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	410	 This clustering pattern strongly suggests orthology between mammalian and fish Shadoos, an inference previously made on the basis of sequence conservation (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	411	 As noted previously, conserved genomic context and failure to detect SPRNB in mammalian genomes suggests either that the SPRNB gene has been lost between fish and mammals or that it is highly diverged and yet to be found.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	412	It is established that gene duplication occurred in several fish lineages and that many duplicated fish genes have only one homolog in mammals (Taylor et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Two fates of duplicated genes have been proposed.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The classical model of neofunctionalization predicts that one of the duplicate loci retains its original function, whereas the other duplicate is fixed only if rare beneficial mutations occur (Ohno 1970).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	415	 This model fits current knowledge of Shos and Sho2s, with the Sho2 duplicate either deleted in mammals (and other tetrapods?) or so highly diverged by neofunctionalization that its mammalian ortholog is not recognizable.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	416	 The alternative model proposes that both duplicates are preserved because of subfunctionalization, where proteins encoded by the duplicates complement each other functionally (Force et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	417	 This model fits the fish stPrPs, which have sequences similar to each other but dissimilar to those of tetrapod PrPs.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	418	Protein Sequence Features We introduced previously a model for the structures of mature Sho, PrP, and PrP-related proteins, which is a useful basis for discussing both conserved and highly variable regions in these sequences (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	419	 The model consists of four regions: a basic region 1, which shows a tendency for insertion of repeat or other sequence (region 2), a hydrophobic region 3, and a C-terminal region 4.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Figure 1 and figures S3 and S4 of Supplementary Material online show the model represents a quite dynamic structural scaffold, with substantial differences in the presence, lengths, and sequence compositions of the regions and insertions among the complete Sho/PrP set, particularly taking account of the numerous fish proteins.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	421	 As we have already compared the sequence features of all proteins in figure 1 except for the ones newly reported here (TestPrP-2, ZestPrP-3, TeSho, FuSho2, TeSho2, CaSho2, and ZeSho2 [see table 1]), we confine attention here largely to the new proteins.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	422	Fish proteins from the known stPrP set (FustPrP-2, 424 residues; TestPrP-2, 395 residues; FustPrP-1, 461 residues; and ZestPrP-3, 561 residues) are much longer than tetrapod PrPs (frog, 216 residues; turtle, 270 residues; chicken, 273 residues; and human, 253 residues) or fish PrP-like proteins (170 to 190 residues) and show significant sequence heterogeneity among themselves, especially in the seemingly "free format" low-complexity repeats and large insertion in region 2 and for large insertions within region 4.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	423	 Most of the difference in length between TestPrP-2 and FustPrP-2 is in the large insertion in region 2, whereas the very large ZestPrP-3 protein shows increases of approximately 90 and approximately 45 residues in the region 2 insertion and in region 4, respectively, compared with stPrP-2s.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	424	 More useful alignment and analysis requires better knowledge of the number of stPrP proteins in individual fish and their variation among the major fish lineages (see also Protein Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis above).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	425	 As shown in figure 1, the new stPrPs are also predicted to have N-terminal and C-terminal signal sequences for extracellular export and GPI-anchor attachment, respectively (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	426	 2003 and Materials and Methods), and also one disulfide bridge and three N-glycosylation sites.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	427	The main significantly conserved feature among all PrP-related proteins is the hydrophobic region 3 (residues 112 to 131 in HuPrP) and also subsequent sequence in region 4 up to about residue 160 (HuPrP).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	428	 Interestingly, this includes the beginning of sequence shown to be folded in the NMR structures (L125-R228 for HuPrP [Zahn et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	429	 2000]) and includes the first unusual (highly hydrophilic) -helix (D144-M154, HuPrP) and the first part of the antiparallel ss-sheet (Y128-G131, HuPrP).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	430	 This segment also includes the region from residues 119 to 138 (HuPrP) implicated as a PrPC dimerization site and potential binding site for PrPC-PrPSc complex formation (Horiuchi and Caughey 1999; Zuegg and Gready 2000).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	431	 We note a repetitive insertion in this region in fish PrP-like proteins.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	432	Compared with PrP-related proteins, conservation of features, including length, is much higher in the Sho/Sho2 set.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	433	 We previously noted very high conservation (identity 81% to 96%) among mammalian Shos (human, mouse, and rat), and good conservation, particularly for zebrafish, between fish and mammalian sequences to slightly beyond the end of the hydrophobic sequence (identity 41% to 53%, zebrafish 1 to 78) (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	434	 The fish proteins are all of similar length (FuSho, 146 residues; TeSho, 149 residues; ZeSho, 131 residues; FuSho2, 150 residues; TeSho2, 150 residues; ZeSho2, 136 residues; CaSho2, 145 residues).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	435	 There is an insertion in the Fugu and Tetraodon Sho basic repeats that is not present in other Shos.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	436	 Of note, however, is that Sho2 sequence in this region is different from that in Shos, with the Sho basic region N-terminal to the hydrophobic region being missing in Sho2s.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	437	 Although there are some local regions of sequence conservation, including around the N-glycosylation site conserved in all Shos and Sho2s, the C-terminal regions of fish Shos and Sho2s are quite diverged; this is also the sequence region most diverged between fish and tetrapod Shos (see above).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	438	Model for the Evolution of PRNP-Related and SPRN-Related Genes In their paper reporting the finding of the fish PrP-like protein to coding genes, Suzuki et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	439	 (2002) made the initial suggestion of an evolutionary link between the fish PrP-like protein to coding genes and tetrapod PRNP genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	440	 This was based on both weak "homology" (both encode extracellular GPI-anchored proteins with repeats and an unusual internal hydrophobic region [see figure 1]) and context-based (conservation of genes encoding Rassf2 and Slc23a1 in both genomic contexts) criteria.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	441	 (2003) of the stPrP-2 to coding gene proximal to the PrP-like protein to coding gene in Fugu, somewhat strengthened the homology argument for an evolutionary relationship between tetrapod PRNPs and this fish gene because the C-terminal regions of the proteins are similar, whereas those of PrP-like proteins are quite different (see figure 1).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	442	 However, this finding weakened the context-based argument.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	443	 Although the orientation of the stPrP-2 gene is now the same as that of mammalian PRNP, the two genes are separated from the Rassf2 coding gene by different genes (PrP-like gene and PRND) with different orientations (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	444	 We have suggested previously that this could be accounted for by independent duplications.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	445	 (2003) also reported another fish gene, stPrP-1, in another genomic context.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	446	 In our earlier paper (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	447	 2003) reporting the finding of the SPRN gene in both fish and mammals, we provided clear evidence, both homology and context based, that suggested a direct evolutionary relationship.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	448	 However, at this stage, we had no evidence for an evolutionary link between Sho and PrP proteins, although the overall structural features were intriguingly similar.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	449	In this paper, we applied several methods of homology-based (VISTA genomic global alignment, promoter-region footprinting, and protein sequence alignment and phylogenetics) and context-based (genomic context and relative gene order and orientation) analysis to see whether more definitive statements can be made on the relationships between the fish and tetrapod genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	450	 We also included in the analyses sequences of several relevant new genes we found in fish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	451	 It is now clear that fish contain a plethora of genes with similarities to PRNP and SPRN, with quite diverged sequences even among the few fish lineages available to us.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Also, data on SPRN and PRND genes of tetrapods other than mammals are lacking.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	453	 Remarkably, in all these genes, the ORF is contained within a single exon.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	454	 Hence, although we can make some firm conclusions, others are more tentative and await the correction of the current draft data for Fugu, Tetraodon, and zebrafish genomes as well as the availability of more data for tetrapod lineages other than mammals (i.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	455	, amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials, and monotremes).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	456	Considering first the issues for PrP and related genes, our VISTA analysis for global alignment of genomic environment does not show conservation between mammalian PRNP and fish stPrP-2 and PrP-like protein to coding genes, although the adjacent Rassf2 and Slc23a1 coding genes align with their fish orthologs in the exons.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	457	 There is clear evidence of rearrangements in this genomic region, as the PRND gene (and PRNT gene in human) exists in mammals but not in fish, where the PrP-like protein to coding gene is so far reported only in fish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	458	 It, thus, seems clear that the PRNP and stPrP-2 to coding genes have diverged greatly since they last shared a common ancestor.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	459	 There is no basis for suggesting functional homology; that is, the genes are likely to have evolved significantly different functions.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	460	 Second, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the gene duplication giving rise to stPrP-1/stPrP-3 and stPrP-2 is likely to have occurred after evolutionary separation of fish and mammals.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	461	 The clustering of the fish stPrPs separately from the tetrapod PrPs in figure 7 is indicative of the divergence of the amino acid sequence between the fish and higher-vertebrate proteins, and of likely different functions.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	462	Remarkably, we found a new SPRN-related gene, SPRNB, adjacent to the stPrP-1 coding gene in both Fugu and zebrafish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	463	 As current data indicate the genomic contexts of the genes (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	464	 2) are different, caution in interpreting these results is necessary.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	465	 However, it seems unlikely to be accidental that these two genes have been found together twice.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Hence, these findings provide the first hint of an evolutionary link between the SPRN and PRNP families.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	467	 The fact that these two genes code for the unique hydrophobic segment, as we reported initially (Premzl et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	468	 2003), is further evidence at the protein level of an evolutionary link.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	469	Considering now the SPRN/SPRNB genes, a quite different picture emerges.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	470	 All evidence suggests mammalian and fish SPRN/sprn genes are likely to be orthologous; that is directly descended from a common ancestor and with preserved function.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	471	 VISTA analysis shows the SPRN gene aligns in our cross-species analysis, together with its adjacent genes, whereas protein-sequence alignment and phylogenetic-tree analysis also indicate conservation between mammalian and fish Shos.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	472	 Phylogenetic analysis shows Shos and Sho2s lying on two separate branches (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	473	 8), implying the two genes were duplicated before the divergence of fish from tetrapods.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	474	We present an evolutionary model consistent with these various findings in figure 9, as a basis for discussion and future investigation.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	475	 The model proposes that the ancestral gene leading to all the PrP-related and Sho-related encoding genes was the SPRN-like gene.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	476	 First, an ancient prevertebrate duplication produced the SPRNA and SPRNB genes within an environment that may have contained the AO-binding protein and GTP-binding protein encoding genes proximally, and the Rassf2 and Slc23a1 encoding genes distally.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	477	 The model then proposes separation of the SPRN and SPRNB genes, by a translocation of half of the gene cluster.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	478	 The subsequent history of the two branches suggests the genomic environment containing the SPRNB gene was highly recombinogenic, whereas that containing the SPRNA gene was stable, leading to the currently known fish and mammal Sho orthologs.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	479	 The stability of this gene suggests that orthologous SPRN genes coding Sho protein will be found in the other tetrapod lineages.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	480	 A further duplication of the SPRNB gene is then proposed, still before the divergence of fish from tetrapods, with the duplicate genes acquiring additional C-terminal coding sequence to produce SPRNB1 and SPRNB2 protogenes with a completed C-terminal domain, as in tetrapod PrP and fish stPrP-1/-2/-3 proteins (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	481	View larger version (14K):    FIG.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	482	  An evolutionary model for origin of Sho-related and PrP-related coding genes consistent with current data for vertebrates.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	483	  As shown in figure 9, acquisition of the additional sequence to form the complete C-terminal domain at this stage is necessary to explain subsequent gene evolution steps.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	484	 It is intriguing that this model predicts the C-terminal domain sequence of genes evolved from SPRNB1 and SPRNB2 has been truncated or replaced at least three times, leading to the PrP-like protein and Sho2 (SPRNB) coding genes in fish and the PRNT gene in human.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	485	 Figure 9 shows that SPRNB2 translocated at this ancestor stage as separate contexts is consistent with the known fish stPrP-1 and stPrP-2 gene contexts (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	486	 However, as no genes descendent from SPRNB2 are reported in tetrapods, it is not certain if this translocation occurred before or after the separation of fish from tetrapods.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	487	After divergence of fish from tetrapods, the model proposes independent duplications of the SPRNB1 and SPRNB2 protogenes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	488	 In the tetrapod lineage, a gene duplication of SPRNB1 produced a gene cluster containing PRNP and PRND genes, together with Rassf2 and Slc23a1 coding genes.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	489	 The timing of this duplication is unclear because known genes are limited to PRNPs in frogs, reptiles, birds, and mammals and PRND in mammals.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	490	 As noted above and elsewhere in this paper, it is not known at what stage the SPRNB2 gene was deleted in tetrapod evolution or whether it has simply diverged beyond levels currently detectable in mammals.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	491	 The model allows for a more ancient origin of PRNT than necessary simply to explain the existing minimal data (i.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	492	, absent in rodents but present in human).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	493	In the fish branch, initial duplications of the SPRNB1 protogene to produce stPrP-2 and PrP-like protein to coding genes and duplications of the SPRNB2 protogene to produce SPRNB (Sho2 coding gene, as observed) and stPrP-1 to coding gene, are proposed.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	494	 As drawn in figure 9, these gene clusters are already separated.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	495	 If the separation occurred after these duplications, translocation of the SPRNB and stPrP-1 fragment might more conveniently explain the different contexts observed in Fugu and zebrafish.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	496	 The additional complexity and plethora of genes in fish is consistent with existing knowledge of the higher rate of gene duplication in fish and the fact that many duplicated fish genes have only one homolog in mammals (Taylor et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	497	Dynamics of Mammalian PRNP and SPRN Genes We observed some interesting differences in the mammalian SPRN and PRNP gene characteristics, which offer some insights into how these genes have been evolving.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	498	 First, although in the SPRN and PRNP local genomic environments (covering several genes as in VISTA analyses in figure 4 and in figure S2 of Supplementary Material online), we found the percentage of repetitive elements is comparable (tables S2 and S3 of Supplementary Material online), at the single-gene level the picture is strikingly different.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	499	 The SPRN gene has no transposable elements, whereas PRNP and PRND have up to 46% and 24%, respectively, in human, all in the introns (table 2).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	500	 Consistent with this picture of gene dynamics, the brain-specific SPRN gene has evolved conservatively between fish and mammals, and Sho is predicted to have a conserved basic function in vertebrate brain.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	501	By contrast, we have shown that the PRNP gene has undergone major and rapid changes at several levels of comparison: it does not align with sequences of fish stPrP-2 to coding genes (fig.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	502	 4); the sequence, and subsequence composition (Strumbo et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	503	 2001), of the tetrapod PrPs (frog, reptile, bird, and mammal) show significant differences; and the number of exons and size of introns varies significantly in mammals (Lee et al.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	504	 1998; Makrinou, Collinge, and Antoniou 2002 [table 2]).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	505	 These features are characteristic of genes evolving under relaxed evolutionary constraints, typical of proteins with rapidly evolving function (Harrison and Gerstein 2002; Kitami and Nadeau 2002).
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	506	 What these functions are has yet to be elucidated.
0.3283119.15342797.html.plaintext.txt	507	 Despite extensive study, the functions of mammalian PrP remain elusive (Aguzzi and Hardt 2003), and no functional studies, or tissue expression profiles, of the other tetrapod PrPs have been reported.

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, June 10, 2005 , and in revised form, July 20, 2005.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	3	At least for some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, host genetic factors modulate susceptibility to prion infection.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This phenomenon was initially discovered in sheep, in which several mutations within the coding sequence of the prion protein gene (PRNP) are known to lead to increased or decreased scrapie susceptibility (10 to 14).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In humans, a polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP coding sequence is strongly correlated with susceptibility to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as all human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients share the homozygous Met129/Met129 genotype, whereas Val129/Val129 and heterozygous individuals have not been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease so far.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, in cattle, none of the known polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP coding sequence seem to have an influence on BSE susceptibility.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Alternatively, it has been speculated that the promoter region of the PRNP gene might influence the expression level of the protein and thus the incubation period of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (15).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	8	We previously reported the first tentative association of BSE susceptibility with polymorphisms in the PRNP gene promoter (1).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In our previous study, the allele frequencies at two linked insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms within the bovine PRNP promoter differed significantly between the 48 healthy and 43 BSE-affected German cattle analyzed.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The most common haplotypes at these two polymorphisms contained either both insertions (referred to as ins/ins) or both deletions (referred to as del/del).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The frequency of the del/del haplotype was higher in the BSE-affected group.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We therefore hypothesized that the observed differences in haplotype frequencies may reflect differences in PRNP promoter activity.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	13	 According to this hypothesis, the del/del allele, which was over-represented in the affected group, should show stronger promoter activity than the ins/ins allele.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To test our hypothesis, we investigated the functional properties of different allelic variants of the bovine PRNP promoter by performing reporter gene assays in vitro and by quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in vivo.

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The experiment showed that the 23-bp insertion allele produced strong and specific band shifts with transcription factor RP58.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, the deletion allele produced only a weak band shift that could be competed with the unlabeled insertion allele, indicating that RP58 has a higher affinity for the insertion allele than for the deletion allele.

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The shifted band with the G allele had a higher intensity; however, as this allele was predicted to be the non-binding allele for NEUROG1, the polymorphism was not further studied.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Both allelic AP2 probes did not produce any band shift, whereas a control oligonucleotide with a perfect AP2 consensus site led to a shifted band of the expected size.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In the case of EGR4, both allelic probes produced identical band shift patterns with two bands for each probe.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This led to the conclusion that only the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms are involved in differential allelic PRNP promoter modulation and thus in PrPc expression.

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In addition to the reporter gene constructs, the transcription factor-expressing plasmids pRP58 and pRSV/SP1 were added to some wells.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This study was performed in triplicates at 3 (PT) or 2 (KOP) separate weeks (nPT = 9 and nKOP = 6) (supplemental Fig.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	157	The addition of pRSV/SP1 to the p12Ins and p12Del vectors resulted in elevated luciferase expression levels with both constructs in PT cells, but only with p12Del in KOP cells (PT, pp12Ins = 0.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In PT cells, the increase in expression was also much more pronounced with p12Del than with p12Ins.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The p12Del reporter gene construct includes three putative SP1-binding sites (positions  to 98 to  to 93, +351 to +356, and +901 to +906).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In addition to these three SP1-binding sites, the p12Ins vector harbors an additional one within the 12-bp insertion at position +300.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	161	In the long constructs, the overexpression of SP1 consistently led to slightly increased luciferase expression if the 23-bp deletion was present at position  to 1594, regardless of whether the 12-bp indel polymorphism with the SP1 site was present or not.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, in three of four assays with the 23-bp insertion at position  to 1594, the overexpression of SP1 had no significant effect on luciferase expression.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	163	 SP1 overexpression also led to an increase in reporter gene expression with pInsIns in the PT cell line.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Thus, the presence of the 23-bp insertion in the 5'-flanking sequence seemed to reduce the SP1-induced activation of the PRNP promoter.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The overexpression of recombinant RP58 also increased luciferase expression in all four constructs with the 23-bp deletion at position  to 1594, whereas the expression level did not change significantly in all four constructs with the 23-bp insertion.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	166	qRT-PCR Experiments We collected 96 bovine tissue samples from each the brain stem, intestinal lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	167	 RNA was isolated and used for qRT-PCR experiments measuring the absolute transcript quantities of the PRNP and GAPDH genes by the standard curve method.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	168	 A relative quantification was performed by dividing the PRNP expression level by the GAPDH expression level.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	169	 DNA from the same tissue samples was used for genotyping with regard to the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Five different genotypes were identified: 23del:12del (n = 27 to 30), 23del:12het (n = 5 to 6), 23het:12het (n = 39 to 41), 23het:12ins (n = 6 to 7), and 23ins:12ins (n = 15 to 16).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The results from qRT-PCR were evaluated with respect to these five genotype groups.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	172	The expression levels of the four different tissues differed widely.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The highest PRNP mRNA expression levels were encountered in the brain, followed by the spleen, liver, and intestinal lymph nodes.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Within these tissue groups, the brain stem, spleen, and liver showed no significant differences in mean expression levels with respect to the genotypes.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In lymph node samples, the 23het:12ins expression levels were lower than the 23del:12del, 23del:12het, and 23het:12het expression levels (supplemental Fig.

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Allelic variants at these six potential transcription factor-binding sites differ with respect to the consensus binding sites, and the involved transcription factors are themselves expressed in relevant tissues for BSE pathogenesis.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These putative transcription factors are SP1, AP2, RP58, NEUROG1, EGR4, and POZ.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	184	 SP1 is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in the regulation of many promoters (24).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	185	 AP2 plays a role in tissues of ectodermal origin (25).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	186	 RP58 was named according to its function and is expressed mainly in the brain (26, 27).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It includes a POZ domain, which has been described as an interactor with SP1.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	188	 It has been suggested that the POZ domain represses transcription by interfering with the DNA-binding activity of SP1 (28).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	189	 EGR4 (also called nerve growth factor-induced clone C) is like neurogenin-1, a protein that is most likely involved in brain function (29, 30).

0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	198	  All six transcription factors were studied by EMSAs.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	199	 All oligonucleotide probes with the exception of the two allelic variants of the AP2-binding site produced band shifts.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In the case of the two indel polymorphisms, the observed band shifts differed between allelic PRNP promoter variants.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was checked by competition with unlabeled probes.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In the case of SP1, the identity of the shifted band from the nuclear brain extract was further corroborated by a positive control experiment using purified recombinant SP1.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The results of the RP58 EMSA suggest that RP58 had a higher affinity for the 23-bp insertion allele.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The weak affinity of RP58 for the 23-bp deletion allele is not surprising, as the RP58-binding site is duplicated with just one mismatch outside the indel polymorphism.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	205	Following the initial evidence from the EMSA experiments, we created reporter gene constructs with these polymorphisms in every possible combination.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The 12-bp indel polymorphism in intron 1 was deliberately included in the analysis, as it has previously been shown that intron 1 elements are necessary for bovine PRNP promoter activity (17).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our reporter gene assays revealed an influence of the indel polymorphisms on PRNP transcription rates.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Surprisingly, in a short construct, the 12-bp insertion alone resulted in an increased expression level, whereas in the long construct in combination with the 23-bp insertion, the 12-bp insertion caused a decreased expression level.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These findings are compatible with a model in which RP58 binds to the 5'-flanking sequence of the PRNP gene and represses PRNP promoter activity by an interaction with SP1 bound within intron 1, similar to known RP58-SP1 interactions in other promoters (28).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	210	RP58 seems to be a logical candidate for the repressing factor.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	211	 At this time, the identity of the repressing factor has not been definitely proven.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The EMSA results certainly hinted at an involvement of RP58; however, the cotransfection experiments with RP58 were inconclusive.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	213	 A possible explanation for these results is that the recombinant human RP58 used was indeed able to bind to the recognition sequence within the bovine promoter, but not to exert its repressing function in the heterologous bovine system.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	214	The influence of the PRNP promoter genotype with regard to the 23- and 12-bp indel polymorphisms on PRNP expression in vivo was further studied by qRT-PCR experiments.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We chose tissue samples from the spleen, brain stem, and intestinal lymph nodes because of their importance in the infection route of the prions.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The liver was chosen as a control organ because it is supposedly not involved in BSE pathogenesis.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Only the lymph nodes showed a significant distribution of the five genotype groups.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	218	 As the expression level of PRNP in intestinal lymph nodes was very low compared with that in the other organs, this result raises the intriguing question of whether the low PRNP amounts in intestinal lymph nodes are rate-limiting for the conversion of cellular PrPc into PrPSc during the spread of BSE infection toward the central nervous system.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The higher expression level of the pDelDel plasmid is consistent with our previous finding that the 23del:12del genotype is associated with higher susceptibility to BSE in German cattle (1).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	220	Our results tentatively indicate that individuals with deletion alleles at the 23-bp indel polymorphism have higher PRNP expression levels in their intestinal lymph nodes.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The influence of the promoter polymorphism on the expression levels is rather limited in comparison with the observed variance.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	222	 This might be because we analyzed whole tissue samples, which may have been composed of varying proportions of different cell types.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Future analyses should be performed at the single cell level, e.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	224	 by in situ hybridizations, as it has previously been demonstrated that PRNP expression is not completely uniform within lymph nodes (32).
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Despite the large variance, the observed differences in PRNP expression levels are consistent with the notion that the 23-bp deletion allele is associated with higher susceptibility to BSE in German cattle.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	226	In conclusion, we have shown that two indel polymorphisms in the bovine PRNP promoter that contain binding sites for the RP58 and SP1 transcription factors modulate the expression level of PRNP in vitro.
0.34315994.16141216.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Our in vivo data show that the PRNP genotype may contribute to the observed high variance of PRNP expression in intestinal lymph nodes.
