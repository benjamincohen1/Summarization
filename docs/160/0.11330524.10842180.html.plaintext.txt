The Prnd gene encodes a homolog of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) called doppel (Dpl). Up-regulation of Prnd mRNA in two distinct lines of PrP gene ablated (Prnp0/0) mice, designated Rcm0 and Ngsk, is associated with death of Purkinje cells. Using recombinant Dpl expressed in Escherichia coli and mouse neuroblastoma cells we demonstrate that wild type (wt) Dpl, like PrPC, adopts a predominantly -helical conformation, forms intramolecular disulfide bonds, has two N-linked oligosaccharides, and is presented on the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Dpl protein was detected in testis of wt mice. Using Triton X-114 phase partitioning to enrich for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, Dpl was detected in brain samples from Rcm0 Prnp0/0 mice but was absent in equivalent samples from wt mice and ZrchI Prnp0/0 mice, indicating that ectopic expression of this protein may cause cerebellar pathology in Rcm0 mice. Biochemical and structural similarities between PrPC and Dpl documented here parallel the observation that ataxic Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice can be rescued by overexpression of wild-type PrP transgenes, and suggest that cell surface PrPC can antagonize the toxic effect of Dpl expressed in the central nervous system.

The prion protein gene, Prnp,1 encodes PrPSc, the major structural component of the etiological agent in disorders such as scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In uninfected animals, Prnp encodes a cellular protein denoted PrPC, which is thought to be converted to PrPSc by a posttranslational mechanism during the course of prion infections. Although Prnp is conserved in mammalian species, the ZrchI and Npu lines of Prnp0/0 gene-ablated mice remain healthy throughout development (1-3); this may indicate that PrPC serves a function that is not apparent in a laboratory setting, or perhaps that other molecules fulfill an overlapping function. An insight into this issue has emerged from large scale sequencing (4). Although Prnp was originally considered to be unique within the mammalian genome, it has recently been shown to have a paralog (5). The mouse gene Prnd is located 16 kilobases downstream of Prnp and encodes the 179-amino acid Dpl protein. Corresponding Dpl coding sequences are located downstream of Prnp in both humans and rats, and most likely in other mammals. Dpl has approximately 25% sequence identity with the C-terminal two-thirds of PrPC and is predicted to contain three -helices and two disulfide bonds, but is notably lacking an octapeptide repeat domain like the one present at the N terminus of PrPC (5).
Unlike Prnp, abundant Prnd mRNAs are absent from the brains of wild-type (wt) animals, although species of 1.7 and 2.7 kilobases are present in high levels in both heart and testis (5). Interestingly, however, inappropriate expression of Prnd mRNA in the central nervous system is associated with a neurodegenerative syndrome. The Rcm0 and Ngsk lines of Prnp0/0 mice display normal early development but develop a widespread loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells at around 70 weeks of age, which is accompanied by a progressive ataxia (5, 6). These mice differ from asymptomatic Prnp0/0 mice in that they carry chromosomal deletions that extend beyond the Prnp open reading frame into intron 2 at the 5' end, and extending into the 3'-untranslated region of the Prnp mRNA (encoded by exon 3) at the 3' end. These deletions eliminate the Prnp exon 3 splice acceptor site and result in the generation of high levels of Prnd transcripts in the brain by an unusual mechanism involving exon-skipping and intergenic splicing (5). Although it is possible that long range perturbations in chromatin structure underlie the ataxic phenotype of the Rcm0 and Ngsk lines of Prnp0/0 mice, the parsimonious interpretation of the available data is that Dpl overexpression is toxic to Purkinje cells. Finally, it is noteworthy that disease in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice is abrogated by reintroduction of a wt Prnp transgene (7), providing genetic evidence for an interaction between PrPC and the molecules that cause Purkinje cell loss.
In this work we sought confirmation of previous predictions regarding the biochemical and structural properties of the Dpl protein. We demonstrate that recombinant Dpl refolded under standard conditions adopts a predominantly -helical conformation, and that Dpl expressed in mouse neuroblastoma cells possesses two N-linked oligosaccharides and is attached to the cell surface via a GPI anchor. These findings show that Dpl and PrPC resemble one another with respect to their post-translational modifications and subcellular localization. We also report that Dpl protein is present in the brains of Rcm0 mice, but is undetectable in the brains of wt FVB/N mice and the ZrchI line of PrP-knockout mice. Our findings are discussed in the context of the transgene rescue experiments indicating interactions between Dpl and PrPC.

Expression, Purification, and Refolding of Mouse Dpl 27-154-- The DNA fragment coding for mouse Dpl (MoDpl) 27-154 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from cosmid I/LnJ-4 using the oligonucleotide primers: 1) N-terminal primer (5'-GGGGCATATGTCTAGGGGCATAAAGCACAGG-3') and 2) C-terminal primer (5'-GGGGGATCCTATCACCTTTCCAGCCAGAAATCGCA-3'). The amplified gene was cloned into the plasmid pRBI-PDI-T7 via the NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. This expression plasmid was named pMoDpl27-154. In this plasmid, the mouse Dpl gene is under the control of the T7 promoter/lac operator sequence (8, 9). According to the N-end rule in bacteria (10), we introduced a Ser at the N terminus of MoDpl 27-154 to minimize proteolytic degradation in the cytoplasm. The recombinant MoDpl 27-154 consists of 130 amino acid residues with the correct gene sequence verified by DNA sequencing. Cells of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) including pMoDpl27-154 were grown at 37  degrees C in 1 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100  microg/ml). At A600 nm = 0.8-1.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the culture was incubated at 37  degrees C for another 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000  x  g for 10 min and suspended in 20 ml of suspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml DNase I, 0.4 mg/ml RNase A, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), then shaken at 37  degrees C for 2 h and at room temperature for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 4  degrees C at 39,000  x  g for 1 h. The insoluble inclusion bodies were washed twice with 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 23% sucrose (w/v), 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mini-complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet, EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and solubilized in 10 ml of dissolve buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 8 M urea, 1 mini-complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet, EDTA-free). After centrifugation at 39,000  x  g at 22  degrees C for 1 h, 3 ml of supernatant was applied to a SP-Sepharose column (20 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 8 M urea, using a BioLogic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The isocratic rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions were collected in 1.5 ml/tube. MoDpl 27-154 was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.6 M). Fractions containing MoDpl 27-154 were pooled and diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 8 M urea to a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1  microM, and the solution stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The oxidation was quenched by addition of 1 mM EDTA. The solution was dialyzed against double-distilled H2O, concentrated by Centriplus 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off concentrators (Amicon) to 1 mg/ml, and stored at 20  degrees C. Recombinant mouse PrP (MoPrP 23-231) was prepared as described previously (11).
Electrophoretic Analyses and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing-- Proteins were boiled in the gel loading buffer for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10-20% Tricine gels, and stained with Coomassie Blue. For N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the protein was electrophoresed on a 10-20% Tricine gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and stained by Coomassie Blue. The membrane was sliced and individual bands sequenced using a Porton Gas-phase Microsequencer model 2090 and on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis.
Amino Acid Analysis and Determination of Protein Concentration-- The amino acid analysis was performed on a Waters Pico-Tag system calibrated in triplicate using a collection of derivatized amino acid standards. Dried MoDpl 27-154 was hydrolyzed using 6 M HCl with 1% phenol at 110  degrees C for 24 h. After hydrolysis, excess HCl was removed from the hydrolysis tube under vacuum, the sample was derivatized, dissolved in sample diluent (pH 7.4) and an aliquot injected into a Waters Pico-Tag column running on a Waters Pico-Tag gradient, with a column temperature of 33  degrees C. For tabulation of individual amino acids, yields are expressed as percentage weight or percentage content with a molecular weight correction for loss of one water molecule per residue.
S-Carbamidomethylation of Cysteines-- MoDpl 27-154 (1.2 mg/ml) in 50  microl of S-carbamidomethylation buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride) was incubated with or without 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 1 h. The reduced or non-reduced MoDpl 27-154 was incubated with 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Iodoacetamide reacts with free SH group of cysteine to yield a carbamidomethyl cysteine, with a concomitant increase in molecular mass of 57 Da. 1  microl of reduced or non-reduced MoDpl 27-154 treated with IAM was then used for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric (MALDI-MS) analysis without further purification.
Trypsin Digestion of MoDpl 27-154-- Trypsin digestion was carried out with MoDpl 27-154 (1 mg/ml) in 20  microl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2. 1  microl of modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) solution (2 mg/ml in 50 mM acetic acid) was added to yield a final enzyme protein ratio of 1:10. After incubation at 37  degrees C for 2 h, 2  microl of 1 N HCl was added to bring the mixture to pH 3.0 and inactivate the trypsin. One half of the sample (10  microl) was moved to another tube and mixed with 2  microl of 0.1 M tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin (Pierce) in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0. The mixture was incubated at 37  degrees C for 30 min for reduction of the disulfide bond-containing tryptic peptides. 1- microl aliquots of reduced or non-reduced tryptic peptide mixtures were used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification.
Mass Spectrometric Molecular Weight Determination and Peptide Mapping-- MALDI time-of-flight MS analyses were carried out using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems Inc.), equipped with a pulsed UV nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse) and a dual microchannel plate detector. For molecular mass determination of full-length MoDpl 27-154 protein, spectra were acquired at linear-DE mode, acceleration voltage set to 25 kV, grid voltage at 95% of the acceleration voltage, guide wire voltage at 0.150%, delay time at 320 ns, and low mass gate was set at 1000 Da. The mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the molecular mass of a mixture of proteins (mass: 5734.58-16,952.56 Da). For analysis of tryptic peptides, the spectra were acquired at reflectron-DE mode with acceleration voltage set to 20 kV, grid voltage at 72% of the acceleration voltage, guide wire voltage at 0.050%, delay time at 200 ns, and low mass gate at 250 Da. The mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the mass of a mixture of standard peptides (mass: 904.46-5734.58 Da). Saturated -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for analysis of tryptic peptides, and saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for protein analysis. 1  microl of a solution of MoDpl 27-154, reduced or non-reduced S-carbamidomethyl MoDpl 27-154, or reduced or non-reduced tryptic peptide mixture was applied on the MALDI plate followed by 1  microl of saturated matrix solution. Spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent and processed using GRAMS software for data collection and analysis. Predicted masses were calculated by the ExPASy Peptide Mass program.
Circular Dichroism-- Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed by a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Using a cell of path length 1 mm, scans were conducted between 190 and 250 nm at a scan speed of 20 nm/min with a sensitivity of 50 millidegrees. All CD spectrum measurements were performed at room temperature, in 20 mM phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.0. Spectra were subject to curve-smoothing and where noted converted into [], mean residue ellipticities, in degrees cm2/dmol based on the protein concentration determined by amino acid analysis using the Pico-Tag system.
Antibodies-- The anti-Dpl rabbit polyclonal Ab, D7177, was raised against the synthetic Dpl-2 peptide as described previously (5).
Cell Lines-- The mouse neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, was obtained commercially (ATCC) and used to establish all cell lines. The cDNA for mouse Dpl was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) and used to establish the stably transfected line of Dpl-expressing cells, called Dpl-3, as described previously (5). The Dpl-7 cell line, which expresses no Dpl mRNA or protein when assayed by Northern and Western blotting, respectively (5), and untransfected N2a cells were used as negative controls.
Preparation of Cell Lysates-- Cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium for Dpl-3 and Dpl-7 cultures was additionally supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Cells were washed three times in HBSS, scraped into HBSS, pelleted at 1000  x  g at 4  degrees C, and then resuspended in cell lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing one mini-complete protease inhibitor tablet. Cells were disrupted by agitating for 10 min at 4  degrees C and then centrifuging at 20,000  x  g for 10 min at 4  degrees C to remove insoluble debris. Cleared supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at 80  degrees C until needed.
Preparation of Tissue Homogenates-- Ten percent (w/v) homogenates of tissues were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing a mini-complete protease inhibitor tablet on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were spun at 3000  x  g for 10 min at 4  degrees C, and the cleared supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 80  degrees C until needed. The concentration of total protein in each sample was determined using a Bradford assay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).
PNGase F Digestion-- Aliquots of cell lysate or tissue homogenates were thawed, 0.1 volume of 10 x  denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 10% -mercaptoethanol) was added to each sample, and tubes were boiled for 10 min. To each sample, the following was added: 0.1 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 volume of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). 0.2 volume of PNGase F (1 unit/ microl in 50  microM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; New England Biolabs) was added to all samples except those to be used as negative controls to which 0.2 volume of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) alone was added. Samples were incubated for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, or 120 min at 37  degrees C with gentle shaking. 0.25 volume of 4 x  Laemmli buffer was added to each sample following incubation, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting.
PIPLC Incubation-- Dpl-3 and Dpl-7 (negative control) cell lines were grown to 80-90% confluence on a 10-cm2 dish as noted above. Cells were washed three times in HBSS, and then incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) with or without 0.2 units/ml PIPLC (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37  degrees C. Cell medium was recovered and transferred to a tube containing 0.1 volume of 10 x  TNE (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl, 50 mM EDTA). Recovered medium was centrifuged at 2500  x  g for 5 min at 4  degrees C to remove any cellular debris. The cleared medium was concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Centricon tube (Amicon), and then methanol-precipitated. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 1 x  Laemmli buffer and stored at 80  degrees C for later analysis. After removal of the medium, cells were washed three times in HBSS, scraped into 5 ml of HBSS, and pelleted at 1000  x  g for 5 min at 4  degrees C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in cell lysis buffer and transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Cells were disrupted by agitating for 10 min at 4  degrees C and then centrifuging at 20,000  x  g for 10 min at 4  degrees C to remove insoluble debris. Cleared supernatant was transferred to a new tube, 0.25 volume of 4 x  Laemmli buffer was added, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting.
Triton X-114 Phase Partitioning-- Prior to conducting Triton X-114 phase partitioning, stock solutions were prepared as follows. A 3% (v/v) aqueous solution of Triton X-114 was thoroughly mixed at 4  degrees C to solubilize the detergent and then incubated overnight at 37  degrees C to induce phase transition. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the lower detergent phase was mixed with 0.1 volume of 10 x  TNE to create a Triton X-114 stock.
The hydrophobicity of cellular proteins was determined by harvesting cells as described above and resuspending the cell pellet in 1 x  TNE containing 0.25 volume of Triton X-114 stock. Recovered medium was first cleared, concentrated, and methanol-precipitated as described above; proteins were then resuspended in 1 x  TNE containing 0.25 volume of Triton X-114 stock. All samples were cooled to 4  degrees C and then centrifuged at 3000  x  g for 10 min at 4  degrees C to remove any insoluble aggregates. Supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube, heated at 37  degrees C for 10 min to induce phase transition, then centrifuged at 3000  x  g for 10 min to pellet detergent-protein micelles. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, again mixed with 0.25 volume of Triton X-114 stock at 4  degrees C, and then heated to 37  degrees C to induce phase transition. This repartitioning of the aqueous phase was repeated two more times, resulting in the generation of four separate detergent phases and a single aqueous phase. Detergent phases one, two, and three were pooled in a single tube. All samples were then precipitated by adding 5-10 volumes of methanol, incubating overnight at 20  degrees C, and then centrifuging at 3000  x  g for 30 min at 4  degrees C. Samples were resuspended in 1 x  Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.
Triton X-114 phase partitioning of mouse tissue homogenates was conducted as follows. Volumes of 10% (w/v) tissue homogenate corresponding to 50  microg of total protein were thawed and mixed 1:4 with 1 x  TNE containing 0.25 volume of Triton X-114 stock. Samples were mixed at 4  degrees C and then partitioned as described above.
Western Blotting-- Prior to fractionation by SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 5 min and the centrifuged at 20,000  x  g for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto 10-20% Tricine gradient gels (Novex) and electrophoresed at 125 V for approximately 90 min. Samples were transferred to 0.2- microm nitrocellulose (Schleicher  and  Schuell) for 60 min at 100 V in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5) containing 150 mM glycine, 20% (w/v) methanol, 0.01% SDS. Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 3 h at room temperature and then probed with D7177 Ab at a concentration of 1:1,250 in 0.5% (w/v) milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Where D7177 Ab was preincubated with the immunogenic Dpl-2 peptide, 20  microg of peptide was added to the antibody and incubated with gentle shaking at room temperature for 3 h prior to use. The secondary Ab used was goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antisera (Bio-Rad). Blots were visualized using ECL or ECL-Plus detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions and exposed on X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.).

Expression and Authentication of Recombinant MoDpl 27-154-- Dpl is predicted to contain N- and C-terminal signal peptides, directing expression into the secretory pathway and addition of a glycolipid anchor, respectively (Ref. 5 and this paper). Accordingly, an expression cassette was constructed omitting these signal peptide regions (MoDpl 27-154; Fig. 1) by amplifying DNA from the I/LnJ-4 cosmid clone (12). The N terminus of the reading frame was modified by the addition of a methionine. Since the wild-type N-terminal Arg is predicted to be a destabilizing residue in E. coli according to the N-end rule, (10), a Ser residue was also introduced. Electrophoretic analysis of purified MoDpl 27-154 demonstrated a single species at 14.9 kDa (data not shown), and Edman degradation yielded the anticipated N-terminal sequence SRGIKHRF. MALDI-MS molecular mass analysis of MoDpl 27-154 showed a single charged protein signal ([M+H]+) at m/z 14,917.0 ( plus or minus 1.5) Da (Table I, Fig. 2A), in excellent agreement with the calculated molecular mass 14,916.9 Da ([M+H]+). The only other strong signal present in this analysis (Fig. 2A) is a double charged protein signal at m/z 7458.9 Da, underscoring the purity of the protein sample. Finally, as detailed below, the masses of tryptic peptides derived from the recombinant protein are also in very close accord with those predicted from the nucleotide sequence of Prnd (Table I).

Shaded residues 1-27 represent the cleaved N-terminal signal sequence, while shaded residues 155-179 represent the C-terminal domain thought to be removed upon attachment of a GPI anchor to residue 155. Two N-linked glycosylation sites and two disulfide bonds predicted from computer modeling are indicated. The coordinates of the synthetic Dpl-2 peptide used to raise the D7177 antibody are also indicated.

B, S-carbamidomethylation of cysteine in MoDpl 27-154. Mass spectrum of non-reduced MoDpl 27-154 incubated with IAM. MoDpl 27-154 (1.2 mg/ml) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride was incubated without DTT at room temperature for 1 h. The non-reduced MoDpl 27-154 was incubated with 50 mM IAM at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. C, mass spectrum of reduced MoDpl 27-154 incubated with IAM. MoDpl 27-154 (1.2 mg/ml) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1  microM EDTA, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride was incubated with 10  microM DTT at room temperature for 1 h. The reduced MoDpl 27-154 was incubated with 50 mM IAM at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.
Disulfide Bonds in MoDpl 27-154-- Our preparation scheme for MoDpl 27-154 included exposure to 1  microM Cu(II), to favor formation of an intramolecular of disulfide bond (or bonds). Whereas PrPC has a single disulfide bond, according to computer modeling studies four Cys residues in the C terminus of Dpl (residues 95, 109, 143, and 148) are predicted to participate in two disulfide bonds (5). We therefore employed the S-carbamidomethylation method, previously used to analyze PrP 23-231 (11), to titrate the number of free cysteines in MoDpl 27-154 prepared by this standard oxidation-refolding regimen.
After incubation with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in the presence or absence of DTT at pH 8.0, MoDpl 27-154 was incubated with IAM for S-carbamidomethylation of cysteines and analyzed by MALDI time-of-flight MS. "Native" MoDpl 27-154 (i.e. non-reduced) treated with IAM did not exhibit a significant change in mass; the starting material had a mass of 14,916.9, and IAM-treated material had a mass of 14,918.4 Da, well within the error of 0.05% (~7.5 Da) for this type of analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicates an absence of free cysteines. After reduction with DTT, carbamidomethylated MoDpl 27-154 increased in mass by 231 units to 15,149.0 Da (Fig. 2C), consistent with the addition of four adducts (predicted mass of 15,144.9 Da). These data are compatible with 2 disulfide bridges per MoDpl 27-154 molecule.
Secondary Structure and Disulfide Bonds in MoDpl 27-154-- A solution of MoDpl 27-154 in 20 mM PB, pH 7.0, was examined by far-UV circular dichroism (CD), using mouse PrP 23-231 produced by a similar refolding regimen as a control (9, 11). The Dpl 27-154 sample exhibited a CD spectrum indicative of a high -helical content, as did MoPrP 23-231, with minima at 208 and 222 nm and a maximum at 192 nm (Fig. 3). Standard deconvolution algorithms indicated -helical content for Dpl 27-154 between 28% and 35%, with -sheet estimated at ~15%. These data are compatible with the prediction that Dpl has three -helices analogous to those present in mouse PrPC and that it could have a short -sheet region like PrPC (5, 13-15).

Tryptic peptides of Dpl (see Table I, Figs. 4 and 5) were analyzed by mass spectroscopy to ascertain the connectivity of disulfide linkages. Mass spectra of tryptic digests of native and reduced MoDpl 27-154 samples are presented in Fig. 4 (A and B). As predicted from the analysis with IAM, four signals present in the reduced sample were either absent or present at considerably lower levels than in the native sample (see also Fig. 5B; Table I). These are tryptic peptides 12 (T12) at m/z 2953.9 Da, T13 at m/z 2271.6 Da, T19 at m/z 650.5 Da, and T20 at m/z 1106.0 Da. Parenthetically, the T12 peptide has a propensity to form Na+ adducts (secondary and tertiary peaks immediately to the right of the signal at 2953.9) under the conditions of this analysis, although the significance of this phenomenon is currently unclear. Conversely, additional signals at high mass-to-charge ratios and with large peak heights were present in the un-reduced "native" sample. The peak with the largest amplitude in this analysis was detected at m/z 2920.0 Da and is assignable as T13-S-S-T19 (Fig. 4A; predicted mass, 2920.3 Da). This indicates a disulfide bond between residues 109 and 143, exactly analogous to the PrPC disulfide bond between residues 178 and 213 linking helices B and C. A strong signal was also detected at m/z 4058.6 Da, assignable as T12-S-S-T20 and indicating a Cys95-Cys148 connectivity. However, we also observed signals with small amplitudes indicative of two other disulfide bond connectivities not predicted by computer modeling (Table I, Fig. 4A, and "dashed-line" tryptic peptide maps in Fig. 5B). First, a signal at m/z 1754.4 Da, possibly corresponding to a Cys143-Cys148 bond (predicted mass of the T19-S-S-T20 di-peptide 1755.0 Da), although a peptide indicative of a reciprocal connectivity of T12-T13 was not detected at the predicted mass of 5223.7 Da (data not shown). Second, a smaller signal at m/z 3375.6 Da, assignable as T13-S-S-T20 (predicted mass 3375.7 Da), although again, a signal indicating a reciprocal connectivity of T12-S-S-T19 (predicted mass 3603.0 Da) was not detected. We conclude that, although most MoDpl 27-154 molecules prepared by a standard oxidative refolding scheme contain the Cys109-Cys143 and Cys95-Cys148 linkages predicted by computer modeling (5), lower abundance species with other connectivities or free sulfhydryl groups can be detected under these particular conditions of proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis.

Dpl Has Two N-Linked Glycosylation Sites-- Previous experiments involving immunoblots of Dpl-3 cell lysates showed a heterodisperse signal between ~32 and 41 kDa when blotted with the D7177 Ab. This signal is reduced to a single band at ~17 kDa when cell lysates were incubated with PNGase F prior to blotting, indicating that Dpl is heavily glycosylated (5). When Dpl cell lysates were incubated with PNGase F for different periods of time, it was possible to identify a single intermediate form of Dpl at ~27 kDa, presumably representing the monoglycosylated protein (Fig. 6). Prolonged incubations with PNGase F did not reduce Dpl beyond ~17 kDa. These results indicate the presence of two N-linked glycosylation sites within Dpl, as had been predicted previously (5).

Dpl Is a GPI-anchored Cell Surface Protein-- Analysis of the translated protein sequence of Prnd failed to reveal a classical GPI recognition sequence (5), although a hydrophobic C-terminal extension was broadly compatible with this notion. Resolution of this issue was deemed of importance, as it bears upon the biological site of action of Dpl. Since the D7177 Ab exhibits cross-reactivity with protein species that do not correspond to Dpl (Ref. 5; this paper), it was considered unsuitable for immunohistochemical studies of cell cultures using the GPI anchor cleaving enzyme PIPLC (16). Instead, we sought direct biochemical evidence for a GPI anchor. Fig. 7A shows an immunoblot of cell lysates and medium from the Dpl-expressing neuroblastoma cell line, Dpl-3. When a monolayer of intact Dpl-3 cells was incubated with the enzyme PIPLC prior to collection and lysis, Dpl was present in the recovered medium but absent from the cell lysate. These results contrast with those obtained when non-PIPLC-treated Dpl-expressing cells were Western blotted. In this case, Dpl was detected in the cell lysate but was not present in the recovered medium. Dpl was not observed in the pellet or supernatant fractions of PIPLC and non-PIPLC-treated Dpl-7 cells used as negative controls (data not shown).

A, Dpl-3 cells were incubated with or without PIPLC as indicated by the figure legend. When cells were untreated, Dpl was detectable in the cell lysate but not in the medium. In PIPLC-treated samples, Dpl was detectable in the recovered medium but not in the cell lysate. B, Dpl-3 cells were incubated with or without PIPLC. Cell lysates and recovered medium were then subjected to repeated Triton X-114 phase partitioning. Detergent phases 1-3 (Dt 1-3) were combined, while detergent phase 4 (Dt 4) was kept separate as an internal control for pipetting error. The detergent phases and the aqueous phase (Aq) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Lanes 1-3, Triton X-114 fractions from untreated Dpl-3 cells; lanes 4-6, Triton X-114 fractions from PIPLC-treated Dpl-3 cells; lanes 7-9, Triton X-114 fractions of recovered medium from PIPLC-treated cell. Dpl is only present in lanes 1 and 9.
Triton X-114 phase-partitioning of PIPLC-treated and non-treated Dpl-3 cells and medium was used as another means of confirming the presence of Dpl's GPI anchor. When untreated cell lysates were subjected to Triton X-114 phase partitioning prior to immunoblotting, Dpl was detected in pooled detergent phases 1-3, but was not present in either detergent phase 4 (included as an internal negative control), or the aqueous phase (Fig. 7B). When recovered medium from PIPLC-treated Dpl-3 cells was subjected to Triton X-114 phase partitioning, Dpl was found to have shifted from the detergent phase to the aqueous phase. Together, these results indicate that the Dpl protein is present on the cell surface and is attached via a GPI anchor.
Detection of Dpl in Mouse Tissue Samples-- Homogenates of testis and brain from wt FVB/N mice were incubated with or without PNGase F for 3 h prior to Western blotting. When these samples were electrophoresed and probed with D7177 Ab, Dpl could be observed in the testis samples, but was not detected within brain samples (Fig. 8A). Untreated testis contained a heterodisperse signal from ~29 to 37 kDa, while PNGase F-treated testis displayed a single band at ~17 kDa, which corresponded to unglycosylated Dpl protein. These signals were not observed in blots probed with D7177 that had been preincubated with Dpl-2 peptide, or when blots were probed with pre-immune sera (data not shown).

Lanes 1 and 3 represent untreated tissue homogenates, whereas lanes 2 and 4 were incubated with PNGase F prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Diglycosylated Dpl is present in lane 1, while the unglycosylated Dpl can be seen in lane 2. Dpl is not detectable in lanes 3 or 4. B, brain homogenates from wt FVB/N, ZrchI, and Rcm0 mice were subjected to Triton X-114 phase partitioning to enrich samples for Dpl protein. Samples were split and loaded on identical SDS-PAGE gels. The blot in the left-hand panel was probed with D7177 Ab alone, while the blot in the right-hand panel was probed with D7177 Ab that had been preincubated with Dpl-2 peptide. Left-hand panel, lane 1, detergent phases 1-3 of wt FVB/N testes (positive control); lane 2, detergent phases 1-3 of wt FVB/N brain; lane 3, detergent phases 1-3 of ZrchI brain; lane 4, detergent phases 1-3 of Rcm0 brain; lane 5, aqueous phase of wt FVB/N testes (negative control). Dpl is only detectable in lanes 1 and lane 4 (as indicated by arrowhead). Right-hand panel, lane 6, detergent phases 1-3 of wt FVB/N testes; lane 7, detergent phases 1-3 of wt FVB/N brain; lane 8, detergent phases 1-3 of ZrchI brain; lane 9, detergent phases 1-3 of Rcm0 brain; lane 10, aqueous phase of wt FVB/N testes. The signals corresponding to Dpl protein in the left-hand panel are not present here.
As Prnd mRNA levels are low in the central nervous system of wt FVB/N and C57BL6 mice (5) (i.e. undetectable by standard Northern blotting procedures), Triton X-114 phase partitioning was used to enrich for Dpl, and thereby enhance the possibility of detecting the Dpl protein in brain samples. As Dpl with an intact GPI anchor partitioned within the detergent phase (Fig. 7B), tissue homogenates were subjected to repetitive partitioning and detergent fractions 1-3 were pooled and used for Western blot analysis. When partitioned brain extracts from Rcm0, ZrchI, and wt FVB/N mice (using asymptomatic animals in the case of the Rcm0 knock-out line) were probed with D7177, a ~30-33-kDa signal corresponding to Dpl could be detected in brains from Rcm0 mice, as well as in detergent phases 1-3 from testis of wt animals. A comparable signal was absent from similarly processed brain samples of ZrchI and wt FVB/N mice, as well as the aqueous phase of testis homogenates included as a negative control (Fig. 8B, left-hand panel). A duplicate blot probed with D7177 Ab preincubated with a synthetic Dpl peptide competitor confirmed that the signals attributed to Dpl within wt testis and Rcm0 brain were not due to cross-reactivity of the antibody with a nonspecific antigen (Fig. 8B, right-hand panel). These results indicate that although the Dpl protein is present in the testis of wt FVB/N mice, it is only present in the brains of Rcm0 mice, as suggested by prior Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis of reverse transcriptase synthesized cDNA (5).     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Features of MoDpl 27-154 Expressed in E. coli-- Although a number of difficulties were encountered expressing PrPC in E. coli (17, 18), our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of expressing Dpl in this system. Dpl produced by a standard folding paradigm adopts an -helix rich conformation, a feature it shares in common with full-length PrPC, and demonstrated here in side-by-side CD spectral analyses (Fig. 3). However, since Dpl likely contains two, rather than one intramolecular disulfide bond, novel re-folding protocols may need to be developed to obtain stoichiometric formation of two disulfide bridges without accruing molecules with extraneous connectivities. Although tryptic dipeptides containing the Cys95-Cys148 and Cys109-Cys143 disulfide bonds predicted from computer modeling were the species with the highest peak-heights in the mass spectrometric analyses of re-folded MoDpl 27-154 (Fig. 4A), tryptic peptides indicative of alternative connectivities were present at low levels. In particular, Cys148 located in tryptic peptide 20 has a tendency to form linkages to Cys143 and Cys109. Whether the alternative disulfide linkages represented by T13-S-S-T20 and T19-S-S-T20 di-peptides and the low levels of "free" T13 and T20 peptides represent interchange occurring during refolding, or under the conditions of proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis of the "non-reduced" samples remains to be determined. Nonetheless, there are two implications of our current findings for future studies. First, our figure for the  -helical content of Dpl 27-154 may be an underestimate of the true value; this would be consistent with Dpl lacking the unstructured N-terminal region present in PrP. Second, experiments to verify the Cys95-Cys148 and Cys109-Cys143 disulfide bonds in Dpl purified from mouse tissue samples would appear prudent before embarking upon high resolution structural studies of Dpl polypeptides refolded in vitro.
Glycobiology of Dpl-- Mouse PrP has two consensus Asn-linked glycosylation sites of the form N-X-T occurring at residues 181 and 196. Although only the first site is conserved in mouse Dpl (predicted to occur at residue 111 in the helix B region), a second non-conserved N-V-T Asn-linked glycosylation site was predicted at residue 99. Our data are compatible with the prediction that mature Dpl is glycosylated at two sites (Fig. 6), although further studies will be required to demonstrate that these involve carbohydrate adducts at residues 99 and 111. The Dpl oligosaccharide side chains are resistant to digestion by endoglycosidase H2 but are sensitive to PNGase F, indicating that Dpl is processed in the ER and Golgi, as expected.
PrPC is attached to the cell surface via a GPI anchor (16), and our data now confirm that this is also the case for Dpl, even though it lacks a GPI addition signal peptide closely related to that of PrP. The shift of Dpl protein from the cell lysate to the recovered medium after incubation of live cells with PIPLC provides biochemical evidence that most Dpl in N2a cells is exposed on the cell surface and modified by the addition of a GPI anchor. Triton X-114 phase partitioning was used as an additional means of verifying this conclusion. Proteins with an intact GPI anchor normally partition in the detergent phase, but treatment with PIPLC removes the hydrophobic diacylglycerol moiety of the anchor and results in the recovery of treated proteins in the aqueous phase (19, 20). Using this experimental paradigm, Dpl was found to shift from the detergent phase to the aqueous phase after PIPLC treatment. Although the attachment sites for GPI anchors often correspond to Asp or Ser residues (21), this being Ser231 in the case for PrPC, addition at other amino acid residues is not without precedent. Indeed, GPI anchor signal peptides are somewhat degenerate and addition can occur at a variety of different small amino acids, including alanine, aspartate, asparagine, glycine, or serine (22, 23). In the case of Dpl, prior computer modeling predicts addition to Gly155 (5). It is also noteworthy that, even in the case of PrP, conservation of Ser231 is not ubiquitous: thus rabbit PrPC lacks serine at position 231 and GPI attachment is thought to occur at the adjacent glycine (24).
Dpl Physiology-- Dpl does not appear to be present in the brains of adult wt animals and is associated with neurodegeneration when expressed ectopically in this location (see below). It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that although Dpl may play a role in the initial development of the brain, the principal physiological function likely lies within other tissues. Northern and Western blot data indicate that Dpl is expressed at high levels in the testes of adult wt mice (Fig. 8) and is also present in the heart (5). We anticipate that experiments to determine the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Prnd and to ablate the Prnd coding region will be required to obtain definitive insights into the normal function of this novel PrP-like protein. Nonetheless, some experiments reported here can be interpreted to indicate that Dpl biogenesis is modulated, perhaps in a tissue-specific manner. For example, the Asn-linked side chains associated with (ectopic) expression in the brain appear different to those observed in testis and N2a cells, as indicated by the ~30-33- and ~27-39-kDa species detected by Western blotting. Second, although Prnd mRNA can be detected in testis of wt mice and in the brains of (asymptomatic) Rcm0 mice by Northern analysis (5), Dpl protein is more abundant in the former location than the latter (Fig. 8B). This suggests that Dpl protein expressed in the central nervous system is unstable, or that translation of Dpl from chimeric mRNA in the brains of Rcm0 mice may be less efficient than translation of Prnd mRNA containing a 5'-untranslated region encoded by Prnd exons 1A and 1B (5).
Dpl, PrPC, and Pathways to Neuronal Death-- Prior analyses of Rcm0 and Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice have attributed the cerebellar ataxia present in these mice, but not in other Prnp0/0 lines such as Zrch I and Npu, to an organization of the residual Prnp gene favoring overexpression of Prnd mRNA (5). This correlation now extends to a fifth Prnp0/0 line designated ZrchII (25). Although experiments to express Dpl under the control of a heterologous promoter will be required to cement this relationship, results presented here lend additional support to this hypothesis, and begin to suggest the type of events that may initiate neuronal death. Thus, Dpl protein can be detected in the central nervous system of Rcm0 mice, but not in the brains of wt or ZrchI mice. Further, we demonstrate that Dpl possesses two N-linked oligosaccharides and is attached to the cell surface via a GPI anchor. Thus, Dpl not only resembles PrPC with regard to its amino acid sequence, but also with respect to synthesis in the secretory pathway, certain post-translational modifications, and subcellular localization to the external face of the plasma membrane. It is likely that Dpl's GPI anchor directs it to caveolae-like membrane domains (26, 27), although this remains to be established experimentally. The biochemical similarities between Dpl and PrPC are germane to the observation that Purkinje cell death in Ngsk mice can be abrogated by overexpression of wt PrPC encoded by the Tg4053 transgene array (7). Notably, these similarities suggest that PrPC, by virtue of a C-terminal domain structurally similar to that of Dpl, can antagonize a deleterious activity associated with ectopic expression of Dpl in central nervous system neurons.
One mechanism would be that Dpl binds to another cell surface molecule to initiate a signal leading to cell death, whereas PrPC, when overexpressed, competes for this binding site without initiating a signal transduction event. This type of model was proposed by Schmerling et al. (28) to account for the pathogenic properties of internally deleted PrP molecules and was first discussed in the context of a putative PrP-ligand denoted PrPL. These workers noted that, although ZrchI Prnp0/0 mice exhibit normal development, the introduction of Prnp transgenes encoding PrP molecule where amino acids 32-121 (PrP32-121) or 32-134 (PrP32-134) had been deleted caused these mice to develop ataxia and cerebellar granule cell degeneration (28). Our data do not speak to the hypothetical PrP ligand PrPL, but as Dpl resembles PrPC minus the conserved N-terminal Cu(II) binding domain, they do suggest that expression of the 32-121 and 32-134 "Dpl-like" versions of PrPC in ZrchI mice may activate a Dpl-dependent pathway of neurotoxicity, with pathogenic consequences somewhat akin to those observed in Rcm0 and Ngsk mice (25). Here, partially analogous to the case with Ngsk mice, pathology could be abrogated in ZrchI mice expressing N-terminally deleted PrP by reintroduction of a single copy of Prnp encoding full-length wt PrPC (28), suggestive of competitive inhibition. Identification of a receptor for Dpl with some affinity for PrPC therefore comprises one line of future research, with the potential to yield insights into the physiological and pathogenic attributes of both proteins.
